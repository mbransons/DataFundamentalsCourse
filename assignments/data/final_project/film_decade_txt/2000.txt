"Rachel, let me see. - Can I see? - Finders keepers. And I found it. In my garden. Finders keepers. Bruce? Bruce? Mom! Mr. Alfred! Did you have dream? Nightmare. Worse than this place? They are going to fight you. - Again? - Until they kill you. Can they kill me before breakfast? You are in hell, little man. And I am the devil. You're not the devil. You're practice. Solitary. - Why? - For protection. - I don't need protection. - Protection for them. Get in. Are you so desperate to fight criminals... ...that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time? Actually, there were seven of them. I counted six, Mr. Wayne. How do you know my name? The world is too small for someone like Bruce Wayne to disappear... ...no matter how deep he chooses to sink. Who are you? My name is merely Ducard, but I speak for Ra's al Ghul... ...a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld. A man who can offer you a path. What makes you think I need a path? Someone like you is only here by choice. You have been exploring the criminal fraternity... ...but whatever your original intentions... ...you have become truly lost. And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer? The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil... ...and wishes to serve true justice. The path of the League of Shadows. - You're vigilantes. - No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man... ...if you devote yourself to an ideal... ...and if they can't stop you... ...then you become something else entirely. Which is? Legend, Mr. Wayne. Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something... ...there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can carry it to the top of the mountain... ...you may find what you were looking for in the first place. And what was I looking for? Only you can know that. You turn back. You go back. Ra's al Ghul? Wait. What are you seeking? I seek... ...the means to fight injustice. To turn fear... ...against those who prey on the fearful. To manipulate the fears in others... ...you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin? I can... I can barely stand. Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate or fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us, Mr. Wayne... ...what do you fear? Bruce? It's okay. It's okay. You'll be okay. Will we be needing an ambulance, Master Wayne? No, I'll set the bone and take him for an x-ray later. Very good, sir. - I'm very sorry, sir. I've told... - Don't worry. It's fine. Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce? And why do we fall, Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. Just a little fall. It's just a small fracture. The bats again? You know why they attacked you, don't you? - They were afraid of you. - Afraid of me? All creatures feel fear. Even the scary ones? Especially the scary ones. I got something to show you. - You think your mother will like them? - Yeah. - I think it's time to get up. - Maybe. No going back to bed. Did you build this train, Dad? Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering. People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times. So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city. And at the center... ...Wayne Tower. - Is that where you work? - No, I work at the hospital. I leave the running of our company to much better men. - Better? - Well... ...more interested men. Can we go? Please. Okay. Let's go. - What's wrong, Bruce? - No, no. It was me. I just needed some fresh air. A little bit of opera goes a long way. Right, Bruce? Come on. Let's go. Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast. - That's fine. - Fast. Take it easy. Take it easy. Here you go. It's fine. It's fine. Now just take it and go. - I said, jewelry. - Hey... Thomas! Bruce. It's okay. Don't be afraid. Is this your father's? It's okay. Come here. There you go. It's okay. It's okay. Gordon. Hey. Good news. We got him, son. You're in excellent hands. We'll be watching the empire. When you grow up, it'll be waiting for you. I thought I might prepare a little supper. - Very well. - Alfred? - Yes, Master Bruce? - It was my fault, Alfred. - I made them leave the theater. - No. - If I hadn't gotten scared... - It was nothing that you did. It was him, and him alone. Do you understand? I miss them, Alfred. I miss them so much. So do I, Master Bruce. So do I. And do you still feel responsible for your parents' death? My anger outweighs my guilt. Come. You have learned to bury your guilt with anger. I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth. You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600. You know how to disappear. We can teach you to become truly invisible. Invisible? The ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility. Always mind your surroundings. Ninjitsu employs explosive powders. - As weapons? - Or distractions. Theatricality and deception are powerful agents. You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent. - Who is he? - He was a farmer. Then he tried to take his neighbor's land and became a murderer. - Now he is a prisoner. - What'll happen to him? Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated. Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding. Your parents' death was not your fault. It was your father's. Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act. - The man had a gun. - Would that stop you? I've had training. The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act. Yield. You haven't beaten me. You have sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke. Rub your chest. Your arms will take care of themselves. You are stronger than your father. You didn't know my father. But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangling the grief... ...until the memory of your loved one is just... ...poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed... ...so you'd be spared your pain. I wasn't always here in the mountains. Once, I had a wife. My great love. She was taken from me. Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency... ...who must be fought without hesitation, without pity. Your anger gives you great power. But if you let it, it will destroy you... ...as it almost did me. - What stopped it? - Vengeance. That's no help to me. Why, Bruce? Why could you not avenge your parents? Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir... ...or can I persuade you to stay on for a day or two? I'm not heading back at all. - You don't like it there? - I like it fine. They just don't feel the same way. - I've prepared the master bedroom. - No. My room will be fine. With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house. No, Alfred, it's my father's house. - Your father is dead. - This place is a mausoleum. If I have my way, I'll pull the damn thing down brick by brick. This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered six generations of your family. Why do you give a damn, Alfred? It's not your family. I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible... ...for what was most precious to him... ...in the whole world. Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing. She probably hopes to talk you out of going. Should I just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred? I wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir. Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future. Haven't given up on me yet? Never. Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf. Hasn't he noticed you're tall enough to reach now? Old habits die hard, I guess. - Never used to stop us anyway. - No, it didn't. How's your mom? She misses this place. So do I. Yeah. But it's nothing without the people who made it what it was. - Now there's only Alfred. - And you. - I'm not staying, Rachel. - You're just back for the hearing. Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way to convince you not to come. Someone at this proceeding... ...should stand for my parents. We all loved your parents, Bruce. - What Chill did is unforgivable. - Then why is your boss letting him go? In prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone. He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole. Rachel, this man killed my parents. I cannot let that pass. And I need you to understand that, please. Okay. The depression hit working people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all. His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed... ...but by desperation. Given the 14 years served, as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation... ...with one of this office's most important investigations... ...we strongly endorse his petition for early release. Mr. Chill? Your Honor... ...not a day goes by that I don't wish I could take back what I did. Sure, I was desperate, like a lot of people back then... ...but that don't change what I did. I gather there is a member of the Wayne family here today. Has he got anything to say? - He's coming out the side! - He's coming out the side, guys! Bruce Wayne! Joe! Hey, Joe! Falcone says hi. Come on, Bruce. We don't need to see this. I do. The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden... ...insisted on making the hearing public. Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open. Maybe I should thank them. - You don't mean that. - What if I do, Rachel? My parents deserved justice. You're not talking about justice. You're talking about revenge. - Sometimes, they're the same. - No, they're never the same. Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better. - It's why we have an impartial system. - Your system is broken. You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce. This city is rotting. They talk about the depression as if it's history. It's not. Things are worse than ever here. Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs... ...preying on the desperate, creating new Joe Chills every day. Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce... ...but he's destroying everything that they stood for. You wanna thank him for that? Here you go. We all know where to find him. As long as he keeps the bad people rich... ...and the good people scared, no one'll touch him. Good people like your parents, who'll stand against injustice, they're gone. What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing? - I'm not one of your good people, Rachel. - What do you mean? All these years, I wanted to kill him. Now I can't. Your father would be ashamed of you. You're taller than you look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne. No gun? I'm insulted. - You could've just sent a thank-you note. - I didn't come here to thank you. I came to show you that not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you. Only those who know me, kid. Look around you. You'll see two councilmen... ...a union official, couple off-duty cops... ...and a judge. I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them. Now, that's power you can't buy. That's the power of fear. I'm not afraid of you. Because you think you got nothing to lose. But you haven't thought it through. You haven't thought about your lady friend in the DA's office. You haven't thought about your old butler. People from your world... ...have so much to lose. Now, you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot... ...you know about the ugly side of life, but you don't. You've never tasted desperate. You're... You're Bruce Wayne, the prince of Gotham. You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet someone who didn't know your name. So don't come here with your anger, trying to prove something to yourself. This is a world you'll never understand. And you always fear... ...what you don't understand. All right. Yeah, you got spirit, kid. I'll give you that. More than your old man anyway. In the joint, Chill told me about the night he killed your parents. He said your father begged for mercy. Begged. Like a dog. Should've tipped better. - For what? - Your jacket. Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it. It's a nice coat. Be careful who sees you with that. - They're gonna come looking for me. - Who? Everyone. It's... It's a nice coat. When you lived among the criminals, did you start to pity them? The first time I stole so that I wouldn 't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled... ...I learned the fear before a crime... ...and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them. Fool. What do I care what your name is? You're a criminal. Tell that to the guy who owned these. You've traveled the world to understand the criminal mind and conquer your fears. But a criminal is not complicated. And what you really fear is inside yourself. You fear your own power. You fear your anger... ...the drive to do great or terrible things. Now you must journey inwards. You are ready. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear, you must become fear. You must bask in the fear of other men. And men fear most what they cannot see. You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace your worst fear. Become one with the darkness. Focus. Concentrate. Master your senses. You cannot leave any sign. I haven't. Impressive. We have purged your fear. You are ready to lead these men. You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows. But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice. No. I'm no executioner. Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share. That's why it's so important. It separates us from them. You want to fight criminals. This man is a murderer. - This man should be tried. - By whom? Corrupt bureaucrats? Criminals mock society's laws. You know this better than most. You cannot lead these men... ...unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil. And where would I be leading these men? Gotham. As Gotham's favored son... ...you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality. - How? - Gotham's time has come. Like Constantinople or Rome before it... ...the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice. It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die. This is the most important function of the League of Shadows. It is one we've performed for centuries. Gotham... ...must be destroyed. You can't believe in this. Ra's al Ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts. What he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary. I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men like this... ...but I will not become an executioner. Bruce, please. For your own sake, there is no turning back. - What are you doing? - What's necessary, my friend. I will tell him you saved his life. Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. - Yes, I have. - You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud. Are you coming back to Gotham for long, sir? As long as it takes. I want to show the people... ...their city doesn't belong to the criminals and the corrupt. In the depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises... ...combating poverty. He believed his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city. Did it? In a way. Their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action. People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy. I can't do that as Bruce Wayne. As a man... ...I'm flesh and blood, I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol... As a symbol, I can be incorruptible. - I can be everlasting. - What symbol? Something elemental... ...something terrifying. I assume that as you take on the underworld... ...this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals? You're thinking about Rachel? Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself. Have you told anyone I'm coming back? I couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead. - Dead? - You've been gone seven years. You had me declared dead? Actually, it was Mr. Earle. He's taking the company public. He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding. Those shares are worth quite a bit of money. Well, it's a good thing I left everything to you, then. Quite so, sir. And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like. Just bring it back with a full tank. In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others... ...and prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation. - Dr. Crane. - Miss Dawes. You think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail? I would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would I? This is the third of Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane... ...and moved into your asylum. The work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane. Or the corrupt. Mr. Finch. You should check with Miss Dawes here... ...just what implications your office has authorized her to make. If any. - What are you doing? - What are you doing, Carl? Looking out for you. Falcone has half the city bought and paid for. - Drop it. - How can you say that? Because as much as I care about getting Falcone, I care more about you. That's sweet. We've been through all that. Blessed bat again, sir. They nest somewhere in the grounds. No more favors. Someone is sniffing around. Hey, I scratch your back, you scratch mine, doc. I'm bringing in the shipments. We are paying you for that. Maybe money isn't as interesting to me as favors. I am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone. But you know who I'm working for, and when he gets here... He... He's coming to Gotham? Yes, he is. And when he gets here, he's not going to wanna hear... ...that you've endangered our operation just to get your thugs out of jail time. - Who's bothering you? - There's a girl at the DA's office. - We'll buy her off. - Not this one. Idealist, huh? Well, there's an answer to that too. - I don't want to know. - Yes, you do. No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors. I don't think Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy-arms manufacture... ...as a suitable cornerstone for our business. Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks. I think after 20 years we can allow ourselves... ...to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done. Good morning, Mr. Earle's office. Yes, he's confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening. Good morning. I'm here to see Mr. Earle. Name? Bruce Wayne. Thomas would probably not have taken the company public. But that is what we, as responsible managers, are going to do. Jessica? Jessica? Where are you? - Eye on the ball, and... - Why is no one answering the phone? It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle. I'm sure they'll call back. Bruce? You're supposed to be dead. I'm sorry to disappoint. - I need you to take a look at this. - Have you seen him yet? - Who? - Wayne. It's been all over the news. He's back. I'm sure you realize I can't stop the big machine. Too many wheels turning. - We're going public. - I understand. And I'll be handsomely rewarded for my shares. I'm not looking to interfere. - I am looking for a job. - Oh? I just want to get to know the company that my family built. Any ideas where you would start? Applied Sciences caught my eye. Fox's department. I'll let him know you're coming. You look like him. Your dad. You're the only one left of the Wayne family. This is where you belong. Welcome home. Environmental procedures, defense projects, consumer products. All prototypes. None in production. - On any level whatsoever. - None? What did they tell you this place was? They didn't tell me anything. Earle told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here. Dead end. Place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble. Come on. - You were on the board? - When your father ran things. - You knew my father? - Oh, yeah. Helped him build his train. Here we are. Kevlar utility harness. Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun. The 350-pound test monofilament. Wonderful project, your dad's train. Routed it right into Wayne Tower, along with the water and power utilities. Kind of made Wayne Tower the unofficial center of Gotham City. Of course, Earle let it go to rot. Here we are. Nomex survival suit for advanced infantry. Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints. - Tear-resistant? - This sucker will stop a knife. - Bulletproof? - Anything but a straight shot. - Why didn't they put it into production? - Bean counters didn't think... ...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand. So, what's your interest in it, Mr. Wayne? I want to borrow it. For spelunking. Spelunking? Yeah, you know, cave diving? You expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves? Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle didn't know about me borrowing... Mr. Wayne... ...the way I see it... ...all this stuff is yours anyway. Okay. Give it a try. Charming. At least you'll have company. This must be the lowest foundation of the southeast wing. Your great-great-grandfather was involved in the Underground Railroad... ...secretly transporting freed slaves to the North... ...and I suspect these caverns came in handy. Alfred! Come up here! I can see everything all right from down here, sir, thank you. We order the main part of this cowl from Singapore. Via a dummy corporation. Indeed. And then, quite separately... ...we place an order to a Chinese company for these. - Put it together ourselves. - Precisely. They'll have to be large orders, to avoid suspicion. - How large? - Say 10,000. - Well, at least we'll have spares. - Yes. Don't suppose you want a taste. I just keep offering, thinking maybe someday you'll get wise. There's nothing wise in what you do, Flass. Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste, makes us guys nervous. I'm no rat. In a town this bent, who's there to rat to anyway? Don't turn around. You're a good cop. One of the few. What do you want? Carmine Falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week. Nobody takes him down. Why? He's paid up with the right people. What will it take to bring him down? Leverage on Judge Faden... ...and a DA brave enough to prosecute. Rachel Dawes. Who are you? Watch for my sign. You're just one man? Now we're two. We? Freeze! What the hell was that? Just some nut. Well, what is it today? More spelunking? No. Today it's BASE-jumping. BASE-jumping. - That like parachuting? - Kind of. Do you have any lightweight fabrics? You know, I think I have just the thing. It's called memory cloth. Notice anything? Regularly flexible... ...but put a current through it... ...molecules realign, it becomes rigid. - What kind of shapes can you make? Can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton. Too expensive for the Army? I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd. - Look, Mr. Fox. - Yes, sir? If you're uncomfortable... Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing... ...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie. But don't think of me as an idiot. Fair enough. What's that? The Tumbler? Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that. She was built as a bridging vehicle. During combat, two of these would jump over a river, towing cables. Over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up. This will boost you into a rampless jump... Not now! Not... Not now, sir. Afterburner disengaged. We never could get the damn bridge to work... ...but this baby works just fine. So, what do you think? Does it come in black? I need you at the docks Thursday. - Problems? - I don't want any trouble... ...with the last shipment. - Sure. Word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DA's office. - Is that right? - And that there's a fat prize... ...waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it. So, what's your point, Mr. Flass? Have you seen the girl? It's a cute little assistant D A. Don 't you think that's a little too much heat to bring down, maybe? - Even for this town. - Never underestimate Gotham City. People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week. Sometimes... Sometimes things just go bad. It's a problem with the graphite, sir. The next 10,000 will be up to specifications. - At least they gave us a discount. - Quite. In the meantime, sir, may I suggest you try to avoid landing on your head? Why bats, Master Wayne? Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. What is this? Continue. Looks fine out there. The bears go straight to the dealers. Yeah, and the rabbits go to the man in the Narrows. - What's the difference? - Ignorance is bliss, my friend. Don't burden yourself with the secrets of scary people. Hey. Steiss. Steiss? What? What the...? I better check it. There's a problem out here. You better bail. Where are you?! Here. Get going. Oh, shit. What the hell are you? I'm Batman. Nice coat. Thanks. Hold it. That's right, you better run. Falcone sent them to kill you. - Why? - You rattled his cage. - What's this? - Leverage. - For what? - To get things moving. Who are you? Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. Ma'am? Everything okay? - Falcone's men? - Does it matter? We'll never tie him to it anyway. I wouldn't be too sure of that. What the hell is that? Cut him down. Unacceptable. Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs, Guardian Angels... ...or the goddamn Salvation Army... ...get them off the street and off the front page. They say it was just one guy. Or a creature. It was some asshole in a costume. - Yeah? - This guy did deliver us... ...one of the city's biggest crime lords. No one takes the law into their own hands in my city. Understand? - No way to bury it now. - There's still Judge Faden. - I've got Faden covered. - What about this bat they babble about? Even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat... ...we've got Falcone at the scene. Drugs, prints, cargo manifests. This bat character gave us everything. Okay. Let's do it. - Bats are nocturnal. - Bats may be. But even for billionaire playboys, 3:00 is pushing it. The price for leading a double life, I fear. Your theatrics made an impression. Theatricality and deception... ...are powerful weapons, Alfred. This is a good start. If those are to be the first of many injuries to come... ...it would be wise to find a suitable excuse. Polo, for instance. I'm not learning polo, Alfred. Strange injuries, a nonexistent social life. These things beg the question... ...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money. What does someone like me do? Drive sports cars, date movie stars. Buy things that are not for sale. Who knows, Master Wayne, you start pretending to have fun... ...you might even have a little by accident. Sir. - We have a situation. - All right. The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night... ...heavily damaged, all crew missing, probably dead. The ship was carrying a prototype weapon. It's a microwave emitter. It's designed for desert warfare, but it... It looks like somebody... ...turned it on. It uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply. The damage to the ship was catastrophic. The weapon itself is... Missing? Yeah. Mr. Wayne. Nice car. You should see my other one. He's done something the police never have. You can't take the law into your own hands. Well, at least he's getting something done. Bruce, help me out here. Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues. But he's put Falcone behind bars. And now the cops want him. What does that tell you? They're jealous. Sir, the pool is for decoration... ...and your friends do not have swimwear. Well, they're European. I'm going to have to ask you to leave. - It is not a question of money. - Well, you see... ...I'm buying this hotel... ...and setting some new rules about the pool area. I think the Batman deserves a medal. And a straitjacket to pin it on. Thank you. Bruce? Rachel? I'd heard you were back. What are you doing? Just swimming here. Wow, it is good to see you. You were gone a long time. - I know. How are things? - The same. Job's getting worse. Can't change the world on your own. What choice do I have... ...when you're too busy swimming? Rachel, all of... All this... It's... It's not me. It's... Inside, I am... I am more. Come on, Bruce. Come on. Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy. Bruce... ...deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be. But it's not who you are underneath... ...it's what you do that defines you. Dr. Crane, thanks for coming. Not at all. He cut his wrists? Probably looking for the insanity plea. But if anything should happen... Of course, better safe than sorry. Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore. It's all too much. The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah. A couple of days of this food, it'll be true. - What do you want? - I wanna know... ...how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut. About what? You don't know anything. I know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized. And I know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house. See, I don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets. And those goons you used. I own the muscle in this town. Now, I've been bringing your stuff in for months... ...so whatever he's planning, it's big, and I want in. Well, I already know what he'll say. That we should kill you. Even he can't get me in here. Not in my town. Would you like to see my mask? I use it in my experiments. Now, I'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you. But these crazies, they can't stand it. So when did the nut take over the nut house? They scream and they cry... ...much as you're doing now. Well, he's not faking. Not that one. I'll talk to the judge and see if I can get him moved... ...to the secure wing at Arkham. I can't treat him here. Storm's coming. The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone. It's a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone. Well, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer. They were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers. Why? What about the other half? - Flass knows. - He won't talk. He'll talk to me. Commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to catch you. - He thinks you're dangerous. - What do you think? I think you're trying to help. But I've been wrong before. Come on, I ain't got all night. Flass, I have kids to feed. What, they don't like falafel? Where were the other drugs going? I never knew. I don't know. - I swear to God. - Swear to me! I don't... I don't know. I never knew. Never. They went to some guy for a couple days before they went to the dealers. Why? There was something... Something else in the drugs... ...something hidden. - What? I never went to the drop-off point. It was in the Narrows. - Cops only go there in force. - Do I look like a cop? No... This is the one I'm talking about. - What's your problem with it? - It shouldn't exist. This ship left Singapore with 246 containers, but arrived with 247. I'm guessing there's something I'm not supposed to find in there. Listen, counselor, we don't wanna know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate. Things are working a little differently now. Open it up. What the hell is this? It's you, isn't it? Everybody's been talking about you. Get in here! The other kids won't believe me. Get rid of all traces. - Better torch the whole place. - All right. Having trouble? Take a seat. Have a drink. You look like a man who takes himself too seriously. Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up. Alfred, help me. Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison. Poisonous. Poisonous. Bruce... ...why do we fall? - How long was I out? - Two days. It's your birthday. Many happy returns. I've felt these effects before, but this was so much more potent. It was some kind of hallucinogen, weaponized, in aerosol form. You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne. I called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day. I analyzed your blood... ...isolating the receptor compounds and the protein-based catalyst. Am I meant to understand any of that? Not at all. I just wanted you to know how hard it was. - Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote. - Could you make more? You planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne? Well, you know how it is. You're out at night, looking for kicks... ...someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens... I'll bring what I have. The antidote should inoculate you for now. Alfred, always a pleasure. Lucius. - You sure you don't want to come in? - I have to get back. - I wanted to leave this. - Thank you. Rachel? Looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends. - Must've been quite an occasion. - It is my birthday. I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight. I was just dropping off your present. - You've got better plans? - My boss has been missing for days... ...which means I should probably start by looking at the bottom of the river. - Rachel. - Excuse me. Rachel Dawes. Who authorized that? Get Crane down there now. Don't take no for an answer. Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our own assessment to the judge by morning. - What's wrong? - It's Falcone. Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch. You're going to Arkham now? It's in the Narrows, Rachel. You enjoy your party, Bruce. - Some of us have work to do. - You be careful. Happy birthday. But, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving. Keep them happy until I arrive. Tell them that joke you know. Having fun? Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this? I need some information. The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1 -ME. 1 -ME. It's a microwave emitter. It was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply. Rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemicals into the air... ...but isn't that illegal? I want all the information on the development of this project... ...all data, files, backup disks, on my desk right away. Did you lose one? I'm merging your department with Archives. And I am firing you. Didn't you get the memo? Scarecrow. Scarecrow. Scarecrow. Miss Dawes, this is most irregular. I have nothing to add to the report I filed with the judge. - I have questions about your report. - Such as? Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness... ...to have a psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted? As you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms. - Scarecrow. - What's ""scarecrow""? Patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia... ...on an external tormentor... ...usually one conforming to Jungian archetypes. In this case, a scarecrow. - He's drugged? - Psychopharmacology is my primary field. I'm a strong advocate. Outside, he was a giant. In here, only the mind can grant you power. You enjoy the reversal. I respect the mind's power over the body. It's why I do what I do. I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy. I want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone... ...including blood work. Find out what exactly you put him on. - First thing tomorrow, then. - Tonight. I've already paged Dr. Lehmann at County General. As you wish. This way, please. There's something I think you should see. This is where we make the medicine. Perhaps you should have some, clear your head. Who knows you're here? Who knows? He's here. Who? The Batman. - What do we do? - What anyone does... ...when a prowler comes around. - Call the police. - You want the cops here? At this point, they can't stop us. But the Batman has a talent for disruption. Force him outside, the police will take him down. Go. - What about her? - She hasn't got long. I gave her a concentrated dose. The mind can only take so much. Now go. The things they say about him. Can he really fly? I heard he can disappear. Well, we'll find out. Won't we? Taste of your own medicine, doctor? What have you been doing here? Who are you working for? Ra's... Ra's al Ghul. Ra's al Ghul is dead. Who are you working for? Crane. Dr. Crane isn't here right now. But if you'd like to make an appointment... Batman, put down your weapons and surrender. You're surrounded. - What are you waiting for? - Backup. - Backup? - The Batman's in there. SWAT's on the way. But if you wanna go in now... ...I'll be right behind you, sir. SWAT's on the way. - Hey. - Hey. What's happened to her? Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin. - Let me get her down to the medics. - They can't help her, but I can. Get her downstairs. Meet me in the alley. Crane's been smuggling his toxin hidden in Falcone's drugs... ...and they're dumping it into the water supply. - What was he planning? - I don't know. Was he working for Falcone? He mentioned someone else, someone worse. She needs the antidote before the damage is permanent. - How long does she have? - Not long. What is that? - Backup. - What the...? Excuse me. - How is she? - She's fading. We gotta go. I'll get my car. I brought mine. Yours? I've gotta get me one of those. - He is in a vehicle. - Make and color? It's a black... ...tank. Stay calm. You've been poisoned. I'm on him. Breathe slowly. Hold on. - What are you doing? - Shortcut. Air One to ground, block that ramp. He's got no way off that roof. Turn off your engine. Step away from the car. - Trust me. - Weapons system activated. Who is this guy? - Where's he going? - He's on the roof. - What street is he taking? - He's not on a street. He's flying on rooftops. At least tell me what it looks like. Never mind. Got him. Coming right up on his butt. We're tracking suspect vehicle heading west on I- 17. - Air One to ground. - I lost him. We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked. We'll loop back to check the frontage road. Stealth mode activated. Stay with me. What...? There he is. Just hold on. Rachel! - They get any of this into the mains? - Yeah. Notify the water company. There's gotta be a way to isolate it. No. They put it all in. They must've been at this for weeks. - Gotham's entire water supply is laced. - Why haven't we felt the effects? Must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs. How do you feel? Where are we? - Why did you bring me here? - If I hadn't, your mind would be lost. - You were poisoned. - It was... - It was Dr. Crane. - Rest. Gordon has Crane. Is Sergeant Gordon your friend? I don't have the luxury of friends. I'm gonna give you a sedative. You'll wake up back at home. When you do, get these to Gordon, and Gordon alone. Trust no one. - What are they? - The antidote. One for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production. Mass production? Crane was just a pawn. We need to be ready. When you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham... ...all that stopped me from calling the men in white coats... ...was when you said it wasn't about thrill-seeking. - It's not. - What would you call that? - Damn good television. - It's a miracle no one was killed. I didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred. You're getting lost inside this monster of yours. I'm using this monster to help other people, just like my father did. For Thomas Wayne, helping others... ...wasn't about proving anything to anyone, including himself. It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying. She's downstairs, sedated. I need you to take her home. Well, we both care for Rachel, but what you're doing has to be beyond that. It can't be personal, or you're just a vigilante. - Is Fox still here? - Yes, sir. We need to send these people away. Those are Bruce Wayne's guests. You have a name to maintain. I don't care about my name. It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it. - Mr. Earle. - Happy birthday, Bruce. Thank you. How did the stock offering go? Prices soared. Who was buying? All kinds of funds and brokerages. It's a bit technical. The key thing is... ...our company's future is secure. Great. A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid. What was the plan, Crane? How were you gonna get your toxin into the air? Scarecrow. Scarecrow. Who were you working for, Crane? Oh, it's too late. You can't stop it now. Here. - Happy birthday, Bruce. - Thank you. Thanks. And thank you for that item. You're welcome. - I know you'll put it to good use. - I already have. How long would it take to manufacture on a large scale? Weeks. Why? Somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply. The water supply won't help you disperse an inhalant. What? Unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough... ...to vaporize all the water in the mains. A microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced. Misplaced? Earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it. Go back to Wayne Enterprises now and start making more of that antidote. The police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on. My security clearance has been revoked. That wouldn't stop a man like you, would it? I suppose not. - Bruce, there's somebody you must meet. - Not now, Mrs. Delane. Now, am I pronouncing this right... ...Mr. Ra's al Ghul? You're not Ra's al Ghul. I watched him die. But is Ra's al Ghul immortal? Are his methods supernatural? Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's? Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham... ...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities. I saved your life. I warned you about compassion, Bruce. Your quarrel is with me. You let these people go. You are welcome to explain the situation to them. Everyone. Everybody? I... I want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze. No, really. There's a thing about being a Wayne... ...that you're never short of a few freeloaders, like yourselves... ...to fill up your mansion with. So here's to you people. Thank you. - That's enough, Bruce. - I'm not finished. To all of you... All of you phonies, all of you two-faced friends... ...you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me... ...please, leave me in peace. Please go. Stop smiling, it's not a joke. Please leave. The party's over, get out. The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne. He's turning into a jerk. Amusing. But pointless. None of these people have long to live. Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand. So Crane was working for you. His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers. He was able to weaponize it. He's not a member of the League of Shadows? Of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom. But really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city. Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear. You're gonna destroy millions of lives. Only a cynical man would call what these people have ""lives,"" Wayne. Crime. Despair. This is not how man was supposed to live. The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption... ...for thousands of years. We sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats. Burned London to the ground. Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence... ...we return to restore the balance. Gotham isn't beyond saving. Give me more time. There are good people here. You're defending a city so corrupt... ...we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure. Time to play. When I found you in that jail, you were lost. But I believed in you. I took away your fear, and I showed you a path. You were my greatest student. It should be you standing by my side, saving the world. I'll be standing where I belong. Between you and the people of Gotham. No one can save Gotham. When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time. - You attacked Gotham before? - Of course. Over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated. With Gotham we tried a new one. Economics. But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens... ...such as your parents. Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help. Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal. Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself... ...and Gotham has limped on ever since. We are back to finish the job. And this time no misguided idealists will get in the way. Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary. If someone stands in the way of true justice... ...you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart. - I am gonna stop you. - You never did learn... ...to mind your surroundings. Justice is balance. You burned my house and left me for dead. Consider us even. No one comes out. Make sure. They're all gone? - How many from maximum security? - Every one of them. Serial killers, rapists. Raise the bridges. We don't want any getting off the island. Yeah, I'll raise the bridges... ...when I get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs... ...that are running loose out there. - Come on! I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade. Master Wayne! Master Wayne! What is the point of all those pushups if you can't even lift a bloody log? What have I done, Alfred? Everything my family... ...my father, built... The Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir. I wanted to save Gotham. I failed. Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up. You still haven't given up on me? Never. Down! Harassment! I see harassment! Maybe you'd like to see some excessive force? Madman with a gun. With residents furious at the unprecedented show of police strength... ...to round up the inmates... - We're about to raise these bridges. Officer, I am a Gotham City district attorney. Let me pass. - Just shut up! - Hey, Flass, cool it! Hold these people back. Hey, Gordon. Somebody here to see you. - What are you doing here? - Our friend sent me with this. It counteracts Crane's toxin. Hopefully you won't need it. Not unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air. All right, last one across. People, they want this bridge up in no more than three minutes! Better get you off the island before they raise the bridges. Patrolman! Go! I can't find my mom. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Gentlemen... ...time to spread the word. And the word is... ...panic. Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking. Right there. That water main is right under the Narrows. It's okay. This is Commissioner Loeb. Come on, somebody talk to me. Come on! Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon. What the hell is going on? We need reinforcements. TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops! Gordon! All the city's riot police are on the island with you! Well, they're completely incapacitated! It's okay, it's okay. No one's gonna hurt you. Of course they are! - Crane? - No. Scarecrow. Gordon... ...there's nobody left to send in. So I'm on my own? The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces. This is just the beginning. If they hit the whole city... ...there's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart. - How are they gonna do that? - The train. The monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower. If the machine gets to the station... ...it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the city's water supply. Covering Gotham in this poison. I'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but I may need your help. - What do you need? - Can you drive stick? There you are! There is nothing to fear... ...but fear itself! I am here to help! Batman will save us. He'll come. - He'll come. - Don't peek. This is Gordon. Prepare to lower the bridge. I told you he'd come. Wait. You could die. At least tell me your name. It's not who I am underneath... ...but what I do that defines me. Bruce? Well, well. You took my advice about theatricality a bit literally. - It ends here. - For you and the police, maybe. My fight, however, lies with the rest of Gotham. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a city to destroy. - I can't beat two of your pawns? - As you wish. GPS online. In 100 yards. Gentlemen. Who the hell authorized this? Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles. The pressure's moving along the mains, blowing the pipes. If that pressure reaches us... ...the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow! At the next intersection, turn right. You will never learn. Sorry. - Familiar. Don't you have anything new? - How about this?! You have arrived at Wayne Tower. Evacuate the building. We're on top of the main hub and it's gonna blow. Weapons system activated. Nice ride. Armed. Don't be afraid, Bruce. Come on. Come on. You are just an ordinary man in a cape. That's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train. Who said anything about stopping it? Yes! You never learned to mind your surroundings! Have you finally learned to do what is necessary? I won't kill you... ...but I don't have to save you. - The meeting's already started. - What meeting? Fox, I seem to remember firing you. You did. I got another job. Yours. On whose authority? Batman may have made the front page... ...but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight. Bruce Wayne. What makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises? - The fact that I'm the owner. - What are you talking about? The company went public a week ago. And I bought most of the shares. Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth. Look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing... ...is that my company's future is secure. Right, Mr. Fox? Right you are, Mr. Wayne. Didn't you get the memo? - I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel. - No. No, Bruce... ...I'm sorry. The day that Chill died, I... I said terrible things. But true things. I was a coward with a gun... ...and justice is about more than revenge, so thank you. I never stopped thinking about you. About us. And when I heard you were back, I... I started to hope. But then I found out about your mask. Batman's just a symbol, Rachel. No. This... ...is your mask. Your real face is the one that criminals now fear. The man I loved... ...the man who vanished... ...he never came back at all. But maybe he's still out there somewhere. Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman... ...I'll see him again. - Proved me wrong, you know. - About what? Your father would be very proud of you. Just like me. What will you do? Rebuild it. Just the way it was, brick for brick. Just the way it was, sir? Yeah, why? I thought this might be a good opportunity for... ...improving the foundations. - In the southeast corner? - Precisely, sir. - Nice. - I couldn't find any mob bosses. - Well, sergeant? - It's ""lieutenant"" now. You really started something. Bent cops running scared. Hope on the streets. - But? - The Narrows is lost. And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed. We will. We can bring Gotham back. - What about escalation? - Escalation? We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics. We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds. - And? - And you're wearing a mask... ...and jumping off rooftops. Now, take this guy. Armed robbery, double homicide. Got a taste for the theatrical, like you. Leaves a calling card. I'll look into it. I never said thank you. And you'll never have to., Stop now. Tell me where it is. You and your brethren possess what is not rightfully yours. I don't know what you are talking about. Is it a secret you will die for? - Please. - As you wish. Wait! My God, forgive me. In the sacristy... ...the church of Saint-Sulpice, is the Rose Line. Beneath the Rose. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Symbols are a language that can help us understand our past. As the saying goes, a picture says a thousand words... ...but which words? Interpret for me, please, this symbol. First thing that comes to mind. - Hatred, racism. - Ku Klux Klan. Yes, yes, interesting. But they would disagree with you in Spain. There, they are robes worn by priests. Now this symbol. Anyone? Evil. In English, please. Devil's pitchfork. Poor, poor Poseidon. That is his trident. A symbol of power to millions of the ancients. Now this symbol. - Madonna and child. - Faith. Christianity. No. No, it's the pagan god Horus and his mother, Isis... ...centuries before the birth of Christ. Understanding our past determines actively... ...our ability to understand the present. So how do we sift truth from belief? How do we write our own histories, personally or culturally... ...and thereby define ourselves? How do we penetrate years, centuries, of historical distortion... ...to find original truth? Tonight, this will be our quest. I still think that his whole take on phi was a little far-fetched. I don't think so. I think that the golden ratio is everywhere in nature. Sure, I can do that. My son is a student of yours at Harvard. - Michael Culp? He adores you. - Oh, yeah. He says you're the best teacher he's ever had. Ms. Culp, I think I already gave Michael an A-minus. He told me. Thank you. Mr. Langdon? Hi. Hello professor. I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ. A kind of French FBI. Will you take a look at this photo, please? My police chief, Capitaine Fache, had hoped... ...considering your expertise and the markings on the body... ...you might assist us. Will you excuse me a moment? I was supposed to have drinks with him. Yes, we know. We found your name in his daily planner. He never showed. I waited for over an hour. Why would someone do this to him? Oh, you misunderstand, professor. He was shot, yes. But what you see in the photograph... ...Monsieur Saunire did to himself. Teacher, all four are dead. The snchaux and the Grand Master himself. Then I assume you have the location. Confirmed by all. Independently. I had feared the Priory's penchant for secrecy might prevail. The prospect of death is strong motivation. It is here. In Paris, Teacher. It hides beneath the Rose in Saint-Sulpice. You will go forth, Silas. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. I chastise my body. Capitaine Fache is waiting for you. Okay. - Mr. Langdon. - Yes. I'm Captain Bezu Fache. You like our pyramid? It's magnificent. A scar on the face of Paris. After me, please. It's the pairing of those two pyramids. It's unique. The two are geometric echoes. Fascinating. I'm not sure how much help I'm gonna be here this evening. How well did you know the curator? Not at all. We met only once. We were on a... On a panel together. Something is funny? We didn't agree on much. Frankly, I was surprised when he contacted me. Could we take the stairs? So Saunire requested tonight's meeting. Yes. How? Did he call you? E-mail. He heard I was in Paris. Had something to discuss. What? You seem uncomfortable. - Are any of those real? - Of course not. So you know something of security procedures. Well, I know video surveillance in a museum this size is cost-prohibitive. Most now rely on containment. Yes, forget about keeping the criminals out. Now we keep them in. The Grand Gallery. This is where you found the body. How would you know that? I recognize the parquet floor from the Polaroid. It's unmistakable. Dear God. Let's cover the talking points again, Your Eminence. Many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult. Others, an ultraconservative Christian secret society. - We are a simple Catholic church. - Simple? With a brand-new $47-million headquarters in Manhattan. Our followers are generous, should we apologize for that? Perhaps a less defensive tack, Your Eminence. The press continue to be harsh with us. We are not Cafeteria Catholics. We don't pick and choose which rules to follow. We follow doctrine. Rigorously. Does doctrine necessarily include vows of chastity, tithing... ...and atonement for sins through self-flagellation and the cilice? Many of our followers are married. Many of them have families. Only a small proportion choose to live ascetically... ...in the cloisters of our residential halls. But we are all united in God's work around the world. Surely that is an admirable way to lead one's life. Why are some media referring to Opus Dei as ""God's mafia""? Obviously, some people fear what they don't understand. And because the war finally draws to a close. - Bishop, we need to stay on message. - That will be all, Michael, thank you. Aringarosa. Silas has succeeded. The legend is true. It hides beneath the Rose. My part of our bargain is nearly fulfilled. I meet the council in an hour. I will have your money tonight, Teacher. The Vitruvian Man. It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous sketches. And the star on his skin? A pentacle. And its meaning? The pentacle is ancient. Symbols carry different meanings in different settings. This symbol, professor. This setting. The pentacle is a pagan religious icon. Devil worship. No. No, no, no. The pentacle before that. This is a symbol for Venus. It represents the female half of all things. It's a concept called ""the divine goddess"" by religious historians. You are telling me that Saunire's last act on earth... ...was to draw a goddess symbol on his chest? Why? Captain Fache, obviously I can't tell you why. I can tell you he, as well as anyone, knows the meaning of this symbol... ...and it has nothing to do with worshiping the devil. - Is that so? - Yes. Then... ...what do you make of this? ""O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint."" It's a phrase. Doesn't mean anything, not to me. What would you do if you had such limited time to send a message? Well, I suppose I'd try to identify my killer. Precisely. Precisely. So, professor... Excuse me. Officer Neveu. Please, pardon the interruption. This is not the time. I received the crime-scene jpegs at headquarters... ...and I've deciphered the code. It's a Fibonacci sequence. That's the code Saunire left on the floor. Headquarters sent me to explain, captain. It is the Fibonacci sequence. The numbers are out of order. But before that, I have an urgent message for Professor Langdon. Right? Pardon me? I'm Sophie Neveu, French police, Cryptology. Your embassy called Division. I'm sorry, monsieur, they said it was a matter of life and death. This is the number of your embassy's messaging service. Well, thank you. Hello, you've reached the home of Sophie Neveu. Miss Neveu? This... No. That's the right number. You have to dial an access code to pick up your messages. But I'm getting... It's a three-digit code. It's on the paper I gave you. Professor Langdon, do not react to this message. You must follow my directions very closely and, above all... ...reveal nothing to Captain Fache. You are in grave danger. Church of Saint-Sulpice. Good evening, Sister. I need you to show someone our church tonight. Of course, Father. But so late? Wouldn't tomorrow...? This is a request from an important bishop of Opus Dei. It would be my pleasure. There's been an accident. A friend. I have to fly home in the morning. I see. Is there a restroom I could use? I just wanna splash some water on my face. Yes. She said it is meaningless. Mathematical joke. Is it meaningless? I'll take another look when I come back. I'm sorry. Of course. Do you have a message from Saunire? What are you talking about? Crazy old man. You have me confused with someone else. I was asked to come here and consult. No, you are under hidden surveillance. Yes, and... What? Bring the suspect to the crime scene and hope he incriminates himself. Suspect? Check your jacket pocket. Just look. GPS tracking dot. Accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe. The agent who picked you up slipped it into your jacket... ...in case you tried to run. We have you on a little leash, professor. Why would I try to run? I didn't do anything. So, what do you think about the fourth line of text... ...Fache wiped clean before you arrived? He brought you here to force a confession, Professor Langdon. He's still in there? What's he doing? Fache isn't even looking for other suspects, okay? He is sure you're guilty. When did Saunire contact you? - Today? - Yes, yes. What time? What time? At 3. Around 3. Three. The gallery alarm was triggered at 8. You were... - I was giving a lecture. - At 9. You had the privacy light on in your hotel room until 8:30, right? We call Fache ""the Bull."" Once he starts, he doesn't stop. He can arrest you and detain you for months while he builds a case. And by then whatever Saunire wanted you to tell me will be useless. Stop it! Just stop! Who are you? What are you talking about? Tell you what? Maybe who really killed him. The Fibonacci sequence. I believe Saunire wrote it... ...so his investigation would include cryptographers. That's quite a leap, isn't it? No. And the letters. ""P.S."" P.S., postscript. ""Princess Sophie."" Yeah. Silly, I know. But I was only a girl when I lived with him. Jacques Saunire was my grandfather. Apparently, it was his dying wish that we meet. If you help me understand why... ...I will get you to your embassy, where we cannot arrest you. Fache was never gonna let me just stroll out of here, was he? No. If we are to get away from here, we must find another way. What exactly do you propose? Saunire was reading his book. ""Blood trail."" Excuse me, captain. Crypto called. They identified the code. Neveu told us already. I should have fired her on the spot, barging in like that. Yes. Except they didn't send Neveu. What? Captain, look at this. He jumped! Shit. He's moving again. And fast. He must be in a car. He's going south on Pont du Carrousel. Bastard. That cop will check the whole lower floor. I will only take a moment. Of course. He is much older than I remember. I hadn't seen or spoken to him in a very long time. He phoned my office today. Several times. He said it was a matter of life and death. I thought it was another trick to get back in touch. It seems when he couldn't speak to me... ...he reached out to you. Whatever he needed so badly to say... ...he found neither of us in time. - Wait a minute. - Professor? Come on. It can't be that easy. This is wrong. Yeah. See? This is wrong. The Fibonacci numbers only make sense when they're in order. These are scrambled. If he was trying to reach out, maybe he was doing it in code. Would you hold this, please? This phrase is meaningless. Unless you assume these letters are out of order too. An anagram. You have eidetic memory? Not quite. But I can pretty much remember what I see. Anagram is right. ""O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint"" becomes: ""Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa."" Professor, the Mona Lisa is right over here. Look at this. He must have thrown it from the window. Smart to hit the truck. What, you admire him now? We're stupid. Who did we leave at the museum? Ledoux? Get him on the radio! Get him on the radio! Her smile is in the lower spatial frequencies. The horizon is significantly lower on the left than it is on the right. Why? Well, see, she appears larger from the left than on the right. Historically, the left was female, the right was male. The sacred feminine. Why do you say that? Something Saunire said the first time we came here. There. Blood. Hey. ""So dark the con of man."" No. It doesn't say that. Is it another anagram? Can you break it? Professor, hurry. Hurry! Moon. Sermon. Charms. Demons. Omens. Codes. Monks. Ranks. Rocks. Madonna of the Rocks. Da Vinci. Careful. Careful. This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis. Police! Stay where you are! Let go of the painting... ...and put it on the ground. No. You put your gun down. Now! Or else I will destroy the painting. Hurry up! Slide your gun to me. Be careful. I never really liked this painting. Run. It was Saunire's. I remember finding it once when I was a girl. He'd promised he'd give it to me one day. Have you ever heard those words before, Sophie? ""So dark the con of man""? No. Have you? When you were a child, were you aware of any secret gatherings? Anything ritualistic in nature? Meetings your grandfather would've wanted kept secret? Was there ever any talk of something called the Priory of Sion? The what? Why are you asking these things? The Priory of Sion is a myth. One of the world's oldest and most secret societies, with leaders like... ...Sir Isaac Newton, da Vinci himself. The fleur-de-lis is their crest. They're guardians of a secret they supposedly refer to... ...as ""the dark con of man."" But what secret? The Priory of Sion protects the source of God's power on earth. Shit. I can't do this by myself. I'm in enough trouble as it is. That's my embassy. Please. Even if we could get out of this... Okay. No, no, no. You're not gonna make it. You're not gonna make it! Well, that was... We won't last long in this car. Fache doesn't like to be eluded, even on a good day. We need to get out of sight. Christ, give me strength. You are a ghost. Christ, give me strength. Stealing! In a house of God! Christ, give me strength. You are an angel. Christ, give me strength. You have powerful friends. Bishop Aringarosa has been kind to me. I could not miss this chance to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice. A pity you couldn't wait for morning. The light is not ideal. Tell me, Sister, please, of the Rose Line. A rose line is any line that goes from the North to South Poles. Set into the streets of Paris, 135 brass markers... ...mark the world's first prime meridian... ...which passed through this very church. It hides beneath the Rose. I'm sorry? Sister. I do not want to keep you. I will show myself out. I insist. May the peace of the Lord be with you. And with you. Gray Smart Car. Black roof. Corner of Denain Boulevard at the train station. How could you let them get away? Why not just shoot the damn painting? Imbecile! You should put his cigar out in your hand! Get out of here! They found Neveu's car abandoned at the train station. And two tickets to Brussels paid for with Langdon's credit card. A decoy, I'm sure. All the same, send an officer to the station. Question all the taxi drivers. I'll put this on the wire. Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty. I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt. Robert Langdon is guilty. This is the Bois de Boulogne? We should be safe in this park for a few minutes. Your police don't patrol this park. Stay here. Police. What do you want? Fifty euros for all your stuff. Go and get something to eat. Did it occur to you that could be dangerous? No. And now we have a place to think. Any ideas, professor? You could've just handed me a piece of a UFO from Area 51. ""What's the next step?"" With him, it's always: ""Sophie, what's the next step?"" Puzzles. Codes. A treasure hunt. To find his killer. Maybe there is something about this Priory of Sion. I hope not. Any Priory story ends in bloodshed. They were butchered by the Church. It all started over a thousand years ago when a French king... ...conquered the holy city of Jerusalem. This crusade, one of the most massive and sweeping in history... ...was actually orchestrated by a secret brotherhood... ...the Priory of Sion... ...and their military arm, the Knights Templar. But the Templars were created to protect the Holy Land. That was a cover to hide their true goal, according to this myth. Supposedly the invasion was to find an artifact... ...lost since the time of Christ. An artifact, it was said, the Church would kill to possess. Did they find it, this buried treasure? Put it this way: One day the Templars simply stopped searching. They quit the Holy Land and traveled directly to Rome. Whether they blackmailed the papacy... ...or the Church bought their silence, no one knows. But it is a fact the papacy declared these Priory knights... ...these Knights Templar, of limitless power. By the 1300s, the Templars had grown too powerful. Too threatening. So the Vatican issued secret orders... ...to be opened simultaneously all across Europe. The Pope had declared the Knights Templar Satan worshipers... ...and said God had charged him with cleansing the earth of these heretics. The plan went off like clockwork. The Templars were all but exterminated. The date was October 13th, 1307. A Friday. Friday the 13th. The Pope sent troops to claim the Priory's treasure... ...but they found nothing. The few surviving Knights of the Priory had vanished... ...and the search for their sacred artifact began again. What artifact? I've never heard about any of this. Yes, you have. Almost everyone on earth has. You just know it as the Holy Grail. Please, Saunire thought he knew the location of the Holy Grail? Maybe more than that. This cross and the flower, this could be very old. But look. This metal here underneath is much newer, and there's a modern ID stamp. ""Haxo 24."" And these dots. These dots are read by a laser. This is more than a pendant. This is a key your grandfather left you. He left us, professor. And vingt-quatre Haxo, it's not an ID stamp. It's a street address. This is Jacques Saunire. Please leave a message after the tone. Thank You. Please, Monsieur Saunire, pick up the phone. This is Sandrine Bieil. I have called the list. I fear the other guardians are dead. The lie has been told. The floor panel has been broken. Please, monsieur, pick up the phone. I beg you. Job 38, verse 11. Do you know it, Sister? Job 38:11. Hitherto shalt thou come... ...but no further. ""But no further."" Do you mock me? Where is the keystone? I do not know. No. You are a sister of the Church... ...and yet you serve them: the Priory. Jesus had but one true message. That... Come, you saints of God. Hasten, angels of the Lord. To receive her soul. And bring her to the sight of the Almighty. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Welcome, bishop. May Christ be with you. And also with you. It's been too long, Manuel. I saw your press conference. Very priestly. Vultures. But you need a good cover to fly into Italy these days. So how are things in Rome? We serve at his pleasure. Today is today. But there are many tomorrows. Vatican cellars. Seventy-six, a year of independence. How fitting. I thought you'd like it. I'll fetch the others. Welcome, bishop. This council is convened. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Our words shall never pass these walls. What business, say you? As you know, my request for funds... Yes, 20 million euro in untraceable bearer bonds. A tad more than petty cash. Wouldn't you say, bishop? The endeavor is complex. Freedom has a high cost. And, of course, you will deliver us. How fortunate we are. I only offer a route to the renewal of faith for all men. How humble. Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa. Were we to grant your request... ...when would this mission commence? - Actually, tonight. - What? - It has begun. - We have not agreed. How dare you presume to... I do not presume, I act! The Vatican's unwillingness to support us... ...is both impious and cowardly. Blood is being spilled because true Christian values lie in ruins. No more! This council has forgotten its very purpose. Tonight... ...the Grail will be destroyed. The Priory's few remaining members will be silenced. I was contacted by a man who calls himself only ""the Teacher."" He knows a great deal about this council. And about the Priory. Yes. Two prostitutes identified Langdon and Neveu... ...getting into a taxi in the Bois de Boulogne. Because of your expertise? - I'm sorry? - About the Priory. Do you think that's why Saunire sought you out? I can think of dozens of scholars who know a lot more about it. Actually, I didn't think he liked me very much. Once made a joke at my expense. Got a big laugh out of it. What was it? Good evening. Good evening. How may I help you? Yes. Sir. The door to the right, please. That was quite a performance. The little shit should know better than to play politics with me. I know I got in front of you, old friend. I did what I thought was best. So... ...now what? Now we wait for the Teacher's call. Good evening. I am Andr Vernet, the night manager. I take it this is your first visit to our establishment? Yes. Understood. Keys are often passed on and first-time users... ...are sometimes uncertain of protocol. Keys are essentially numbered Swiss accounts. Often willed through generations. Is it yours, mademoiselle? The shortest safety-deposit-box lease is 50 years. And what's your longest account? Quite a bit longer. Technologies change, keys are updated. But our accounts date back to the beginning of banking itself. Once the computer confirms your key... ...enter your account number and your box is retrieved. The room is yours, as long as you like. What if I lost track of my account number? How might I recover it? I'm afraid each key is paired with a 10-digit number... ...known only to the account bearer. I hope you manage to remember it. A single wrong entry disables the system. - Ten. - Ten. Your grandfather's Fibonacci sequence. Scrambled, unscrambled? Unscrambled. It's your key. Funny, I don't even like history. I've never seen much good come from looking to the past. Moment of truth. My God. I don't believe this. A rose. The rose was a symbol for the Holy Grail. Forgive the intrusion. I'm afraid the police arrived more quickly than I anticipated. You must follow me, please. For your own safety. You knew they were coming? My guard alerted me to your status when you arrived. Yours is one of our oldest and highest-level accounts. It includes a safe-passage clause. Safe passage? If you would step inside, please. Time is of the essence. In there? Hey, is there a problem? Good evening, sir. Police. I just drive from here to Zurich. Not French, English? - English? - Yes. We are looking for two criminals. You came to the right place. They're all criminals here. Would you mind opening the hold? Please. You think they trust us, the wages I get paid? You don't have keys to your own truck? It's armored. Keys get sent to the destination. You mind? I'm on a schedule here. And do all the drivers wear a Rolex? What? This piece of shit. Forty euros in Barbs. Yours for 35. No, no, no. - Thirty. - No. It's okay, it's okay. Come on, 30, eh? I said, no! Move along! Now we wait. The Teacher will call and tell me where to deliver the money. You have put tremendous faith in this Teacher of yours. Yes, I have. And I have given him an angel to do his will. For surely there is no better soldier for God than my Silas. I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins... ...to do penance and to amend my life. Amen. I chastise my body. The Holy Grail. A magic cup. The source of God's power on earth. It's nonsense. You don't believe in God. No. I don't believe in some magic from the sky. Just people. Sometimes that they can be kind. And that's enough? Well, I think it has to be. I think it's all we have. Are you a God-fearing man, professor? I was raised a Catholic. Well, that's not really an answer. Professor, are you okay? Go ahead, open it. Go on. A cryptex. They are used to keep secrets. It's da Vinci's design. You write the information on a papyrus scroll... ...which is then rolled around a thin glass vial of vinegar. If you force it open, the vial breaks... ...vinegar dissolves papyrus... ...and your secret is lost forever. The only way to access the information... ...is to spell out the password... ...with these five dials, each with 26 letters. That's 12 million possibilities. I've never met a girl who knew that much about a cryptex. Saunire made one for me once. My grandfather gave me a wagon. This clearly is not the Holy Grail. Come on. Please, you're not all right. May I try something? I don't know why it works. My mother used to do it when I was scared, I think. You think? Yes. Feeling better, Sophie? My parents died in a car crash with my brother. I was 4. I'm sorry. It was many years ago. Better? Yeah. Okay. Twenty years waiting for someone to come for that box... ...and now it's you two murderers. Bring it to me. I don't know what you're talking about. All right! Okay! Right now! Step back! No one will lose sleep over a couple on a killing spree. Turn around. Turn around! You too, mademoiselle. Sophie! Get in the truck! I'll drive! Hurry! - Better? - Always, if I got too nervous... ...I had to put my head out of the window not to be sick. Saunire used to say I was like a dog. A cute dog. You know, a little dog. What happened between you and your grandfather, Sophie? I've jammed my shoulder, I've been shot at, I'm bleeding. I need to know. You say he raised you, but you two don't talk anymore. You call him by his last name. You say you hate history. Nobody hates history. They hate their own histories. So now you're a psychologist too? What if Saunire had started to groom you for the Priory? What do you mean, groom me? Your grandfather gave you puzzles and cryptex as a child. Say Saunire was hoping one day you would join him in the Priory. Still, years later, when he imagines... ...the Grail is in danger, he reaches out to you. So you are saying all this is real? The Priory, the Holy Grail? We've been dragged into a world of people who think this stuff is real. - Real enough to kill for. - Who? I'm out of my field here. I do know a Grail historian, absolutely obsessed with Priory myth. An Englishman, lives here in France. Do you trust this man? I hope you can. Vernet, Andr. It seems you're not a driver at all. Apparently, you lost your tongue along with your truck. Aiding and abetting two murder suspects. That carries jail time. Speak to my lawyer. All this confusion, violence, vanishing property... It might get around that your bank is less than ideal, don't you think? You think you're in pain now, Andr Vernet? My cause is worth your life. Understand? What do you want? Your truck carries a homing device. Activate it. Please wait. I'll see if he's available. It's on the wrong side. Leigh likes all things to be English, including his cars. Robert! Do I owe you money? Leigh, my friend... ...care to open up for an old colleague? - Of course. - Thank you. But first, a test of honor. Three questions. Fire away. Your first: Shall I serve coffee or tea? Tea, of course. Excellent. Second: milk or lemon? Milk? That would depend on the tea. Correct. And now the third and most grave of inquiries: In which year did a Harvard sculler outrow an Oxford man at Henley? Surely such a travesty has never occurred. Your heart is true. You may pass. Welcome to Chteau Villette. Leigh Teabing has spent his entire life... ...studying the Grail. That thing is one hot tamale. Sorry? The cryptex, it's a hot coal. A hot potato? So you want to keep our chest close to our cards, yes? Very close. Yes. The truck's signal is coming online. It's about time. Locked on and tracking, sir. Very good. Tell Collet not to move in until I get there. Attention! All of Collet's units to Chteau Villette. The suspects Neveu and Langdon are likely at that location. Aringarosa. I still don't know why he put you into this... ...and I'm sorry. But... ...I'm also very glad. You are requested to make yourself at home. Robert! And you travel with a maiden, it seems. Sir Leigh Teabing, may I present Miss Sophie Neveu. Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing. It's an honor to welcome you... ...even though it's late. Thank you for having us. I realize it's quite late. So late, mademoiselle, it's almost early. What a lovely smile you have. Earl Grey? Lemon. Correct. Yes. Chteau Villette. Yes. - No. - Oh, you must. Remy is from Lyons, but nevertheless... ...he is fantastic with sauces. - Thank you. - No, I can't. A dramatic late-night arrival. Mention of life and death. What can an old cripple do for you, Robert? We wanna talk about the Priory of Sion. The keepers? The secret war? Sorry for all the mystery. Leigh, I'm into something here that I cannot understand. You? - Really? - Not without your help. Playing to my vanity, Robert. You should be ashamed. Not if it works. There are always four: The Grand Master and the three snchaux... ...make up the primary guardians of the Grail. Thank you, Remy. That'll be all for now. The Priory's members span our very globe itself. Philippe de Chrisey exposed that as a hoax in 1967. And that is what they want you to believe. The Priory is charged with a single task: To protect the greatest secret in modern history. The source of God's power on earth. No, that's a common misunderstanding. The Priory protects the source of the Church's power on earth: The Holy Grail. I don't understand. What power? Some magic dishes? Robert. Has he been telling you that the Holy Grail is a cup? To understand the Holy Grail, my dear... ...you must first understand the Holy Bible. The Good Book did not arrive by facsimile from heaven. The Bible as we know it was finally presided over by one man: The pagan emperor Constantine. I thought Constantine was a Christian. Oh, hardly, no. He was a lifelong pagan... ...who was baptized on his deathbed. Constantine was Rome's supreme holy man. From time immemorial... ...his people had worshiped a balance between nature's male deities... ...and the goddess, or sacred feminine. But a growing religious turmoil was gripping Rome. Three centuries earlier... ...a young Jew named Jesus had come along... ...preaching love and a single God. Centuries after his crucifixion... ...Christ's followers had grown exponentially... ...and had started a religious war against the pagans. Or did the pagans commence war against the Christians? Leigh, we can't be sure who began the atrocities in that period. We can at least agree that the conflict grew to such proportions... ...that it threatened to tear Rome in two. So Constantine may have been a lifelong pagan... ...but he was also a pragmatist. And in 325 anno Domini... ...he decided to unify Rome under a single religion, Christianity. Christianity was on the rise. He didn't want his empire torn apart. And to strengthen this new Christian tradition... ...Constantine held a famous ecumenical gathering... ...known as the Council of Nicaea. And at this council... ...the many sects of Christianity debated and voted on, well... ...everything, from the acceptance and rejection of specific gospels... ...to the date for Easter... ...to the administering of the sacraments, and of course... ...the immortality of Jesus. I don't follow. Well, ma chre, until that moment in history... ...Jesus was viewed by many of his followers as a mighty prophet... ...as a great and powerful man, but a man nevertheless. A mortal man. Some Christians held that Jesus was mortal. Some Christians believed he was divine. Not the Son of God? Not even his nephew twice removed. Hold on, you're saying Jesus' divinity came from a vote. Well, remember, in those days, gods were everywhere. By infusing Jesus the man with the divine magic... ...by making him capable of earthly miracles... ...as well as his own resurrection, Constantine turned him into a god... ...but within the human world. And he basically knocked the more distant gods out of the game. Constantine did not create Jesus' divinity. He simply sanctioned an already widely held idea. - Semantics. - No, it's not semantics. You're interpreting facts to support your own conclusions. Fact: For many Christians, Jesus was mortal one day and divine the next. For some Christians, his divinity was enhanced. Absurd. There was a formal announcement of his promotion. They couldn't even agree on the Nicene Creed! Excuse me. ""Who is God, who is man?"" How many have been murdered over this question? As long as there has been a one true God... ...there has been killing in his name. Now let me show you the Grail. This used to be the ballroom. I have little occasion to dance these days. I trust you recognize The Last Supper... ...the great fresco by Leonardo da Vinci. Now, my dear, if you would close your eyes. Oh, Leigh, save us the parlor tricks. You asked for my help, I recall. Allow an old man his indulgences. Now, mademoiselle, where is Jesus sitting? - In the middle. - Good. He and his disciples are breaking bread. And what drink? Wine. They drank wine. Splendid. And one final question: How many wineglasses are there on the table? One? The Holy Grail? Open your eyes. No single cup. No chalice. Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it? Considering both the Bible and standard Grail legend... ...celebrate this moment as the definitive arrival of the Holy Grail. Now, Robert, you could be of help to us. If you'd be so kind as to show us the symbols for man and woman, please. No balloon animals. I can make a great duck. This is the original icon for male. It's a rudimentary phallus. - Quite to the point. - Yes, indeed. This is known as the blade. It represents aggression and manhood. It's a symbol still used today in modern military uniforms. Yes, the more penises you have, the higher your rank. Boys will be boys. Now, as you would imagine, the female symbol is its exact opposite. This is called the chalice. And the chalice resembles a cup or vessel or, more importantly... ...the shape of a woman's womb. No, the Grail has never been a cup. It is quite literally this ancient symbol of womanhood. And in this case, a woman who carried a secret so powerful... ...that if revealed, it would devastate the very foundations of Christianity. Wait, please. You're saying the Holy Grail is a person? A woman? And it turns out, she makes an appearance right there. But they are all men. Are they? What about that figure on the right hand of our Lord... ...seated in the place of honor? Flowing red hair. Folded feminine hands. Hint of a bosom. No? It's called scotoma. The mind sees what it chooses to see. Who is she? My dear, that's Mary Magdalene. The prostitute? She was no such thing. Smeared by the Church in 591 anno Domini, poor dear. Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife. This is an old wives' tale. The original one, in fact. There's virtually no empirical proof. He knows as well as I do there's much evidence to support it. Theories. There are theories. Notice how Jesus and Mary are clothed. Mirror images of each other. The mind sees what it chooses to see. And venturing into the even more bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary... ...appear to be joined at the hip and are leaning away from each other... ...as if to create a shape in the negative space between them. Leonardo gives us the chalice. Yes. Oh, and Robert, notice what happens... ...when these two figures change position. Just because da Vinci painted it doesn't make it true. No. But history... ...she does make it true. Now, listen to this. It's from the Gospel according to Philip. Philip? Yes, it was rejected at the Council of Nicaea... ...along with any other gospels that made... ...Jesus appear human and not divine. ""And the companion of the Savior is Mary Magdalene. Christ loved her more than all the disciples... ...and used to kiss her on the..."" But this says nothing of marriage. Well, actually... Robert. Actually, in those days, the word ""companion"" literally meant ""spouse."" And this is from the Gospel of Mary Magdalene herself. - She wrote a gospel? - She may have. - Robert, will you fight fair? - She may have. ""And Peter said, 'Did he prefer her to us?' And Levi answered: 'Peter, I see you contending against a woman like an adversary. If the Savior made her worthy, who are you, indeed, to reject her?""' Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus goes on to tell Mary Magdalene... ...that it's up to her to continue his Church. Mary Magdalene, not Peter. The Church was supposed to be carried on by a woman. Few realize that Mary was descended from kings, just as her husband was. Now, my dear, the word in French for Holy Grail. From the Middle English ""Sangreal""... ...of the original Arthurian legend. Now, as two words. Can you translate for our friend? Sang real, it means ""royal blood."" When the legend speaks of the chalice that held the blood of Christ... ...it speaks in fact of the female womb that carried Jesus' royal bloodline. But how could Christ have a bloodline, unless...? Mary was pregnant at the time of the Crucifixion. For her own safety and for that of Christ's unborn child... ...she fled the Holy Land and came to France. And here, it is said, she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah. They know the child's name. - A little girl. - Yes. If that were true, it's adding insult to injury. Why? The pagans found transcendence through the joining of male to female. People found God through sex? In paganism, women were worshiped as a route to heaven... ...but the modern Church has a monopoly on that... ...in salvation through Jesus Christ. And he who keeps the keys to heaven rules the world. Women, then, are a huge threat to the Church. The Catholic Inquisition soon publishes... ...what may be the most blood-soaked book in human history. The Malleus Maleficarum. The Witches' Hammer. It instructed the clergy on how to locate, torture and kill... ...all freethinking women. In three centuries of witch hunts... ...50,000 women are captured, burned alive at the stake. Oh, at least that. Some say millions. Imagine, then, Robert... ...that Christ's throne might live on in a female child. You asked what would be worth killing for. Witness the greatest cover-up in human history. This is the secret that the Priory of Sion... ...has defended for over 20 centuries. They are the guardians of the royal bloodline. The keepers of the proof of our true past. They are the protectors of the living descendants of Jesus Christ... ...and Mary Magdalene. Sir Leigh? Sometimes I wonder who is serving whom. His sauces are not that fantastic. Yes, can I help you? Yes. They're on the news now. Living descendants? Is it possible? It's not impossible. You have not been honest with me. Your pictures are on the television. You are wanted for four murders! That's why Vernet said ""killing spree."" You come into my home, playing on my passions for the Grail. - That's why he needed you. - You will leave my house! - Leigh, listen! - No, I'm calling the police. Jacques Saunire was her grandfather. You're the obsessive Priory scholar. You still keep lists of who might be in the Priory? I'll bet Jacques Saunire was on one of those lists. He was on your list of who could be Grand Master, wasn't he? - What? - I'll bet he was right at the top. Consider: Four men murdered? The same number as the guardians. What if the Priory was compromised, the other snchaux dead? What if you yourself were dying, a Grand Master? You'd have to pass the secret on to someone you could trust. Someone outside the society. Maybe someone whose training you had begun but never finished. Robert, your ruse is pathetic. Not really. No, that's impossible. Can that really...? Is it the keystone? I'll even show it to you, Leigh. Will you just tell us what the hell it's for? Fache says to wait, so I wait. What's Fache thinking? The truck is here. They're inside. Yes. As the legend foretold: ""It hides beneath the Rose."" Oh, my. Leigh. Leigh? Please. I'm sorry. Yes, of course. Inside the keystone... ...there'll be a map. A map that will lead us to the Holy Grail. To be trained by the Grand Master himself. Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis? Is that how you found this? And he must have sung you the riddle songs. I know some of them. Can you keep secrets? Can you know a thing and never say it again? And codes? I imagine they lie down for you like lovers. A snchal. A guardian of the Grail right here in my own home. Tell him, please. I don't know any of this. Leigh, it's not that simple. She doesn't rem... Robert! Do not move, woman. Cripple. Put the box on the table. What, this trifle? Well, perhaps we can make a financial arrangement. Put the keystone on the table. You will not succeed. Only the worthy can unlock the stone. Rip the gate down. Well, well, my dear. Sit down. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Are you? - Yeah. Yes, well, make yourself useful, you French fool. Get something to restrain this monster. Above the joint. Fortunately, a dragon most easy to slay. He's wearing a cilice. - A what? - Well, look. Inflicts pain so he can suffer as Christ suffered. Not so common these days. Opus Dei. Remy, take care of this. Fache is Opus Dei. The policeman who's chasing us. He wears the cross in the world. Robert. Well, I must say, you two are anything but dull. Leigh? You want what's in this box? We need a way out of here. Well, actually... ...I do have a plane. - Robert! Where do we go? - Come along. - In here. Come in. - Over here. Get the door. Hurry. Over here. Over here. Sophie. Watch out! Be careful. Come, Rem... Shit. Easy. Jesus! Apropos. I can't imagine what your complaint is. I'd be within my rights to shoot you and let you rot in my woods! Put that away. We might need him. Better. Opus Dei. - What is it? - A conservative Catholic sect. Opus Dei is a prelature to the Vatican. You're saying the Vatican is killing people for this box? No, no, no. Not the Vatican... ...and not Opus Dei, but we are in the middle of a war. And one that has been going on forever. On the one side stands the Priory... ...and on the other an ancient group of despots... ...with members hidden in high-ranking positions... ...throughout the Church. And this Council of Shadows tries to destroy proof of the bloodline. And that throughout history, they seek out and kill... ...the living descendants of Jesus Christ. - That's insane. - Is it? How many atrocities and scandals has the Catholic Church... ...rationalized in its time? And what happens... ...if some persuasive scientific evidence emerges that shows... ...that the Church's version of Christ is inaccurate? What if the world discovers... ...that the greatest story ever told is actually a lie? The Vatican faces a crisis of faith unprecedented. I've got a signal now, sir. It's ringing. Roger, look, I'm so sorry. I've got tired of the weather here in France... ...and could you make the plane ready for... ...Zurich. Yes. No, we love Zurich. What the hell do you mean, you lost them? Collet. Captain. You're the one who lost them. You control every step of this investigation. You don't let anybody breathe. You're acting like you lost your mind. What is it with these two birds? Interpol just registered a new flight plan from Le Bourget. Stay out of my way on this, Collet. Did you kill Jacques Saunire? Did you kill Jacques Saunire? I am the messenger of God. Did you kill my grandfather? I am the messenger... Each breath you take is a sin. No shadow will be safe again. For you will be hunted by angels. You believe in God? Your God doesn't forgive murderers. He burns them. Sophie. The Teacher will be pleased. What will you do once you have the Grail? Destroy it. The documents and the sarcophagus, of course. And the heir? Will you exercise the final edict? Spill his blood? There will be no need. Once the sarcophagus is destroyed, DNA testing will be impossible. There is no way to prove a living bloodline. But if you had to... ...would you do as councils have done before us? Christ... Christ sacrificed his life for the betterment of humanity. So, too, may be the fate of his seed. Robert. When we land, you must go straight to your embassy. Is that so? Don't you see it? They never wanted you. Maybe even Fache didn't. It's all about this... ...idiotic little box. That's not too flattering. Crazy old man. Why leave me with this? I should just throw it away. He trusted you, Sophie. A guardian of the Holy Grail. It sounds so stupid. It's quite an honor, if you think about it... ...and take it seriously. He took it seriously enough to get himself killed. Not him. You. He was the only family I knew. And maybe I didn't know him at all. I'm his marionette, Robert. Like a girl again, just with no gift at the end. But you've done enough. I don't know why Saunire picked me to help you, Sophie. But I won't leave you alone in all this. Two marionettes, then. Maybe this is why he chose you. Because you will stay. I need the flight plan. Ten minutes. I asked you to get it for me. I'm on break. Come back in 10 minutes. My nose! My nose! The flight plan, please. You asshole! The...flight...plan! Please. It's not ""cross."" ""Spear""? What happened to her? No one knows. Mary Magdalene lived out her days in hiding. And the zealots pursued her still... ...even in death, trying to destroy proof of her existence. But she always had her Knights. Brave men sworn to defend her. You see, to worship before her sarcophagus... ...to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene... ...was to remember all those who were robbed of their power... ...who were oppressed. Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains and the proof of her bloodline... ...until most believed her sarcophagus... ...the Holy Grail... ...was finally lost in time. What are you doing? At the chateau, you said, ""It hides beneath the Rose."" No, no, no. Do be careful. In Latin, sub rosa. Literal translation... ""Beneath the rose."" We need a mirror. Backwards. In the style of Leonardo himself. Thank you. In London lies a knight a Pope interred His labor's fruit a Holy wrath incurred You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb ""In London lies a knight a Pope interred""? A knight whose funeral was presided over by the Pope. Of course, the Priory knights were not just any knights. Templars. And there's just one place to bury a Templar knight in London. Temple Church. Temple Church. If you'll excuse me, my dear... ...Roger and I must discuss a change in flight plan. Leigh. Harboring and transporting fugitives? You are already implicated enough. You and I, Robert, have observed history. Time has been our glass. We are in history now. Living it. Making it. ""Implicated""? I am on a Grail quest. Forgive me, Robert... ...but you two may well have given this old man... ...the greatest night of his life. Thank you. He's going to want more money. I suppose this is a new technique for investigations. I've lost them. They flew to Switzerland. No extradition. The controller filed charges. Ari was on dispatch. He called me. What's going on, Bezu? You know that I am Opus Dei? Yes. A bishop of my order called me. He said a killer came to him in confession. His name was Robert Langdon. He said I couldn't imagine the evil in this man's heart. That he would keep killing. He said I had to stop him. The bishop broke his vows to tell me this. He charged me to stop Robert Langdon. Tell me, Collet, who have I failed? The bishop? God himself? They've changed their flight plan to London. Go on, Fache. I'll take care of the controller. Maybe he needs a few extra euros. Just tell me next time. I have them, tower. Relay Hawker to land and hold on tarmac. - Secure the area! - Wider! - Armed police! - You two, round the back! Armed police! Put your hands in the air! - Three men up! - Ready! Put your hands in the air! Do it now! I'm afraid that's easier said than done in my case. Oh, good morning. Did that old cannabis charge finally catch up with me? Sir, the French police say you're transporting fugitives... ...and you may have a hostage onboard. I'm to take you all into custody. Sadly, I have an important medical appointment which I can't miss. I'll fetch the car, sir. This is serious, sir. The French police are on their way. Stop! Inspector, I can't afford the time to indulge your games. I'm late and I'm leaving. If it's so important for you to stop us... ...then you're just going to have to shoot us. You can start with him. Search the plane. All right. I could run them over. Bad tip. Let him go. The French cannot be trusted. Everyone comfy? Biscuits? They didn't notice anything? Well, people rarely notice things right in front of their eyes, don't you find? Do you have the bonds, bishop? Yes, I do, Teacher. I have chosen an Opus Dei residence for the exchange. I am honored. By the time you get to London, I will have the Grail. - I take it the news is good, then. - I fly to London. The Teacher is waiting for me there. He has chosen a house of Opus Dei to make the exchange. Mere currency for the location of the Grail. Imagine it. Remember, if we are discovered by the Vatican, we are excommunicated. - So should anything go wrong... - Yes, I know, I know. This council does not exist. As it never has. Old friend. Heaven protect you. Keep an eye out for the police. I must say, Robert, I'm quite impressed... ...by the way you withstood my little airplane. Did he never tell you? When he was a boy, young Robert fell into a well. How old were you? Seven. Treading water all night long, screaming his lungs out... ...to the echoes screaming back. When they found him, he was nearly catatonic. Help! It was a long time ago. Oh, now, now, Robert. You above all people shouldn't be one to dismiss the influence of the past. Temple Church. I always forget it's right here. Built 1185 and modern London just sprang up right around it. Tell me, why has the Priory kept the Grail location secret all these years? I don't know. Some say the Priory wait for the heir to reveal himself... ...which is especially odd... ...since legend suggests he may not know his own true identity. Hello? Why do they make them so scary? Oh, it's cold. ""In London lies a knight a Pope interred."" So which tomb has an orb? Those knights with their legs crossed... ...means they'd been to the Holy Land. Two wear tunics over their armor... ...and two have full-length robes. Two are grasping swords. And one... Two are praying. This one has his arms at his sides. Oh, and this poor fellow has almost disappeared entirely. I don't see any orb that ought be on a tomb. ""Ought be on his tomb."" Are we looking for a missing orb? Maybe. These aren't tombs. - What? Yes, of course they are. - No. - They're effigies. - What? Not tombs. There's no bodies here. This place is wrong. Can we go now? We should go. Sophie! No! Where is the keystone? Do not test me! - Let her go! - Don't hurt her. Give me the keystone! Give it to me! Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is. Just let her go, and you and I can... We'll come to some agreement. Remy. Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away. Put it away. They're too close together. You don't have a clear shot. - Yes, I do. - What do you think you're doing? Thank you, professor. For a moment, this was getting complicated. Oh, this is absurd. Oh, for God's sake, man! That was satisfying. I'm glad this bullshit is over. Throw Teabing in the trunk. What? Here. You okay? Sorry. I don't think he's following. They won't kill Leigh until they find the Grail. - So we have to find it before they do. - I have to get to a library, fast. Lieutenant! One flag off the prints. Remy Legaludec. Petty theft. Skipped out on a hospital bill for a tracheotomy. Peanut allergy. Like Marie. This way. Marie? -My daughter. -Oh yes, Marie. Over here. Where? Up there. What's all that? Very advanced surveillance. It's a listening post. Get me Fache. Four of these names are the men killed last night. He once whined to me about the wasted space of so large a trunk. Let's see if he complains so now. Are you the Teacher? I am. Superbly done. You've been of great service. The cryptex has yet to be opened. I can still serve. You've done enough. We cannot let ego deter us from our goal. I understand. Good. Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei, and you will be rewarded. I will dispose of the old man. Bless you, Silas. Teacher. Christ be with you. We're at least a half-hour to Chelsea Library. If we're gonna help Leigh, that's too long. Where you going? Getting you a library card. Excuse me. May I sit next to you? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. That's great. Didn't say you had a boyfriend. Thanks. Let's see if we can access the database on this. ""In London lies a knight a Pope interred."" Compounding keywords: Knight, Pope, Grail. Your precious treasure was almost lost, and with it, my fortune. Can you believe how well I did? I even convinced the monk. I should be in theater. A toast to our success, Teacher. The end of the journey is near. Your identity shall go with me to the grave. There's your problem, mate. It's your basic linguistic coincidence. See, keywords keep coming up with the writings... ...of some bloke named Alexander Pope. ""A. Pope."" Your grandfather was a genius. Come on. Emergency. Which service do you require? I know the location of two murderers wanted by French police. We've just had a 999 call. Triangulation leads back to Docklands. Caller was male. Claimed your two murderers... ...are hiding at an Opus Dei house. The knight we're looking for is Sir Isaac Newton. His life's work produced new sciences that incurred the wrath of the Church. Gravity, for God sakes. And if you choose to believe... ...he was also a Grand Master of the Priory as well. But if he offended the Catholic Church... ...the Pope would be the last person to preside over his funeral. Well, that's where I got it wrong. ""In London lies a knight a Pope interred."" Sir Isaac Newton's funeral was presided over... ...by his good friend, his colleague, Alexander Pope. A. Pope. His first initial. How did I miss that? Here. Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb. An orb. Yes. Which one? It's not possible to tell if a particular orb is missing. ""An orb with Rosy flesh and seeded womb."" Solar system. The planets. Constellations. Signs of the zodiac. See, our moon is missing. The moons of Saturn and Jupiter. They're not here. Eyes of the cherubs themselves? Robert. These tracks. Look at the cane marks in the dust. Teabing was here. He was alone. When the two of you arrived at my home as you did... ...others might call it God's will. I believed that if I had the cryptex... ...I could solve the riddle alone. But I was unworthy. But you... You have a reason to be here. You're the last remaining guardian of the Grail. Your grandfather and the other snchaux... ...would not have lied with dying breath... ...unless they knew their secret was preserved. How could you know Saunire's last words? Leigh. Grail quests require sacrifice. You are a murderer. No. No. Robert, tell her. When history is written, murderers are heroes. You self-righteous bastard! We need to just walk away. - No, don't. Don't. - Walk away. I'll do what I have to now. Anything. Do you understand? So now... ...can't we all be friends again? This way. I'm going to put this gun down. I only want you both to listen. I'm listening now. For 2000 years... ...the Church has rained oppression and atrocity upon mankind... ...crushed passion and idea alike, all in the name of their walking God. Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring an end to all that suffering... ...drive this church of lies to its knees. Armed police! Drop your weapon! Stop, Silas! We are betrayed, my son. The living heir must be revealed. Jesus must be shown for what he was. Not miraculous, simply man. I'm sorry. Armed police! Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it! Put it down now! Put it down! I am a ghost. The dark con can be exposed. Mankind can finally be set free, and we can do it, Robert. The three of us. How is Silas? Is he...? Is he alive? The monk? Bishop, how would you know this killer's name? Get me out of here, Fache. Wait. Langdon never came to you in confession, did he? One of your followers called you about the crime-scene photos. I cannot be implicated here. There are still important works to be done. You used me. God uses us all. Help me, Fache. Take him. - Did you get his cell phone? - Yes, sir. I'm going to need a trace. Your Silas is dead. The Priory's sacred charge... ...was to reveal the heir at the dawn of the new millennium. The millennium came and went and the living heir remained hidden. The Priory failed in their sacred charge. So, what choice did I have? I sought out the enemy. I persuaded them, the Council of Shadows, that I was an ally. I even asked them for money so they would never suspect me. Rector, I made them call me. ""Teacher."" - Why don't you and I... - No. Robert, no words. On your knees. Do it. No, I mean it. Down. Not you. No, my dear, you... You're my miracle, Sophie. You're the guardian of the Grail. All the oppression of the poor and the powerless... ...of those of different skin, of women. You can put an end to all that. You must explode the truth onto the world. It's your duty. You know the answer to this riddle. Open the cryptex... ...and I'll put down the gun. I have no idea how. I don't know the code. And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Like your grandfather, then. Willing to die for your secret. But by the way you've been looking at your hero... ...I wonder, would you let him die for you? Open it, Sophie, to save his life. - Leigh, you can't just... - Open the cryptex. I don't know how. Open it or he dies. - I swear, I don't know. - Do it! Do it! - Stop it! - I don't know! Stop it! She can't do it, Leigh. But give me a moment. Robert. What are you doing? Please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No! No, Robert! No! No. Oh, the map. It's ruined. The map is ruined. The Grail. It's lost. The Grail is gone. Only the worthy find the Grail, Leigh. You taught me that. Armed police! Drop it! Drop your weapon! Put the gun down. Put the gun down. That one. The old man. You're under arrest! You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defense... ...if you do not mention, when questioned... ...something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say will be given in evidence. I'll have some questions for you. Big crowd out there now. Thank you for your statements. You are free to go, of course. I'm sorry. You thought he was your friend, no? It wasn't only us, was it? He used you too. Leave us, please. Leave us, please. I should have been smarter. I acted on faith, I suppose. I'm sorry. How many? Your grandfather, the other three, maybe more. The monk was given to Teabing as a gift, it seems. To do as he asked. Teabing killed the servant himself, you know. - Remy? - Yes. By poison. How much of it have you been able to figure out? Some. Not enough for it to make sense. It won't ever make sense. I'm sorry. He forgot everything we've learned. Everything we teach. It's why we study history. So we'll stop killing each other. Robert! Robert! Robert! How could you do it? How could you? Robert! To destroy our hope of freedom. To deny every pilgrim the chance to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene. How could you? You couldn't! You solved it. You took the scroll out before it broke! You solved it. Oh, you'll find it, Robert. You'll find it. You know what to do. You'll find the Grail, you'll kneel before her... ...and you'll set her free upon the world! That man there, he's got the map to the Holy Grail! There was every orb conceivable on that tomb except one: The orb which fell from the heavens and inspired Newton's life's work. Work that incurred the wrath of the Church until his dying day. A-P-P-L-E. Apple. The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits The blade and chalice guarding o'er her gates Adorned in masters' loving art, she lies She rests at last beneath the starry skies I think I know where she's gone. I think the Grail has gone home. Built by the Templars themselves. Named for the original Rose Line. Rosslyn Chapel. So this is it. The gift at the end. ""The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits."" You never told me the joke Saunire made of you. What was it? He called me a flatfoot. A beat cop of history. Oh, a dumb policeman... ...who just does his job day after day, of history. You know, his father was one. A policeman. Saunire said he was the most honorable man he had ever known. We are who we protect, I think. What we stand up for. Jewish... ...Christian, Egyptian... ...Masonic, pagan... ...Templar crosses... ...pyramids. I think I've been here before. Sophie. A very long time ago. Come along, Sophie. Sophie. Over here. ""The blade and chalice guarding o'er her gates."" Pagan symbols for male and female. Fused as one. As the pagans would have wanted. We're about to close, I'm afraid. We're just gonna be a moment. Robert. I've never seen that before. The style is... It's unmistakable. These could have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci. ""Adorned in masters' loving art, she lies."" ""She rests at last beneath the starry skies."" The fleur-de-lis. She was here. Her sarcophagus. Mary Magdalene. The Holy Grail herself. She was here. With modern DNA testing, those bones... ...could have shown definitive proof of a bloodline. Where did she go? Did the Church finally get her? This is incredible. Look at this. Look at this. These records go back thousands of years. They date back to the death of Christ. Good God, could these really be the Grail documents? What did he want from us? To find her sarcophagus? How was I ever supposed to figure all this out? When you and your grandfather fought... ...was it something about your past? How could you know that? About how your parents died? Sophie? It was during primary school. I was in his library. Doing research. I was trying to find out about my family. Sophie, where are you, princess? I wanted to know about them. But I couldn't find any records. Not of their death... ...not of the accident. I'd asked him for as long as I could remember... ...but he would never tell me. I told you, no! But why can't I? He stood over me... ...and he wouldn't let me leave. They're dead. Dead and buried. Never look for them, Sophie. Promise me. Swear it! Swear it to me! I kept my promise. The next week he sent me to boarding school. One weekend I came home unexpectedly. And what I saw my grandfather doing... Some ritual. I was so frightened. We hardly ever spoke again. Do you have any memories of your grandfather before the accident? Before your parents were killed? Yeah. No. I don't know. Why? Because I don't think he was your grandfather. These are my parents. My brother. And this is you, isn't it? The paper says the entire family was killed. The mother, the father, the boy, 6... ...and the girl, 4. But your name was never Saunire. It's Saint-Clair. It's one of the oldest families in France. It's from a line of the Merovingian kings. Royal blood. I was so wrong. Saunire didn't want you to help guard the secret of the Holy Grail. Sophie... ...you are the secret. You survived the accident. If it even was an accident. The Priory found out. Somehow they concealed the fact that you were alive. They hid you with the Grand Master himself... ...who raised you as his own. According to all of this... ...Princess Sophie... ...you are the heir. The end of the bloodline. You are the last living descendent... ...of Jesus Christ. What is this? Sophie? Who are you? There have been many names. The keepers. Guardians. The Priory of Sion. But to you, Sophie, we are friends of the man who raised you: Jacques Saunire. He would have wanted you to know that he loved you very much. And that the Priory are here to protect you now... ...as they have always protected our family. I gave you up once... ...knowing I might never see you again. I'm your grandmother, Sophie. I have prayed for this moment for a very long time. Welcome home, child. Hey. No more strings. His last breath to keep me safe. She has some things she wants to tell me. About my family. What will you do? The legend will be revealed when the heir reveals himself. They just got the pronoun wrong. She said when Saunire died... ...he took the location of Mary's sarcophagus with him. So there's no way to empirically prove that I am related to her. What would you do, Robert? Okay, maybe there is no proof. Maybe the Grail is lost forever. But, Sophie, the only thing that matters is what you believe. History shows us Jesus was an extraordinary man... ...a human inspiration. That's it. That's all the evidence has ever proved. But... ...when I was a boy... When I was down in that well Teabing told you about... ...I thought I was going to die, Sophie. What I did... ...I prayed. I prayed to Jesus to keep me alive... ...so I could see my parents again... ...so I could go to school again... ...so I could play with my dog. Sometimes I wonder if I wasn't alone down there. Why does it have to be human or divine? Maybe human is divine. Why couldn't Jesus have been a father... ...and still been capable of all those miracles? Like turning water into wine? Well, who knows? His blood is your blood. Maybe that junkie in the park will never touch a drug again. Maybe you healed my phobia with your hands. And maybe you're a knight on a Grail quest. Well, here's the question: A living descendent of Jesus Christ... ...would she destroy faith? Or would she renew it? So again I say, what matters is what you believe. Thank you. For bringing me here. For letting him choose you... ...Sir Robert. You take care. Yes. Hey. Nope. Maybe I'll do better with the wine. Godspeed. Bloodline. Rose Line. ""Hides beneath the Rose.""

Open gate one. Man walking. Open gate two. Let's go. Face the wall. Got one under escort. - Good morning. - Morning. - State your name for the record. - Daniel Ocean. Thank you. The purpose of this hearing is to determine... ...whether you are likely to break the law again. This was your first conviction, but you've been implicated... ...in a dozen other schemes and frauds. What can you tell us about this? As you say, ma'am, I was never charged. We're trying to find out... ...if there was a reason for committing this crime... ...or just a reason you got caught this time. My wife left me. I was upset. I got into a self-destructive pattern. If released, is it likely you'd fall back into a similar pattern? She left me once. I doubt she'd do it again just for kicks. Mr. Ocean, what do you think you would do if released? - Chips, please. - Sure. - Change 150. Quarters or nickels? - Quarters are fine. - Good luck. - Thank you. 20. Dealer has 19. Good start. - I'm going on break now. - Here. Thank you very much. - Good luck. - You have a good one. - How are you, sir? - Hello, Frank. I beg your pardon. You must have me confused with someone else. My name is Ramn. As you can see right here. - My mistake. - No problem, sir. The table's cold anyway. You might want to try the lounge at Caesars. Gets busy after 1:00. - Yes, sir. Thanks, Ramn. Thank you. - Checking up on current events? - Ramn? Glad to meet you. Frank Catton can't get past the gaming board. - You just got out? - This afternoon. You seen him? I heard he was teaching movie stars how to play cards. Why? You have a plan already? Are you kidding? I just became a citizen again. Officer Brooks... ...this is Danny Ocean. I was told to contact you within 24 hours. No, sir, I haven't been getting in trouble. No, sir, I haven't been drinking. No, sir, I wouldn't even think about leaving the state. Hey, Russ! Rusty. What's up, man? Let me ask you a question. Are you incorporated? You should think about it. I talked to my manager... - Bernie? - Not Bernie. My business manager. Actually, they're both named Bernie. He said what we do could be considered research... ...for a future gig, so I could make it a tax write-off. The one thing is, and this is his thing and it's stupid... ...but I'd have to pay you by check. Or we could just stick to cash. Yeah, let's just stick to cash. We'll begin with five-card draw. Everyone remember that? Who wants to start us out? Josh? Josh. To the left. Deal to your left. - Shane? - Hit me. - It's not blackjack. - Dude! Looking at them doesn't change them. You know what you have. - Left. Left. - Left, I'll get it. Lady bets. Let's keep it moving. - Blue. - Blue, that's a 50. - I'll call? - Okay. Shane's calling. 50. What the hell, it's only pocket change. That's your business. Pretend it's for a reason. Yeah, thanks, man. - Right. - How many? - Four. - You don't want four. You wanna fold. - I wanna fold? - Fold. Is that good? You're done. Let's take that. You're done. You're done. You have three pairs. You can't have six cards in a five-card game. - Maybe one was mine. - Wasn't me. Fellas! All reds. What up, dog? I'm gonna love spending your money. I'm gonna get my car washed. - How's the game going? - Longest hour of my life. - What? - I'm running away with your wife. Great. Isn't that hard, crossing over from television to film? Not for me, dude. Hey, Russ. We got another player... ...if that's cool with you. What do you do for a living? If you don't mind me asking. Why would I mind you asking? Two cards. I just got out of prison. - Really? - Why were you in prison? I stole things. You stole things? Like jewels? Incan matrimonial head masks. - Any money in Incan matrimonial...? - Head masks. Some. Don't let him fool you. There's loads if you can move them. I'll take one. But you can't. - My fence was confident. - You don't need a fence. - Some people lack vision. - Everybody in cellblock E. That's $500. - What's the first lesson in poker? - Never bet on the... - Leave emotion at the door. - Right, Topher. Today's lesson: How to draw out the bluff. That much money, this early... He has nothing better than a pair of face cards. Barry? All right. I fold. - Josh? - Don't worry, I'm game. I will see your $500 and I will raise you another... ...$500 of my own. - That's a very handsome bet. But don't push him too high, too fast. Keep him on the leash. - Holly? - Call. Call. And I'll call. I'll see your $500 and raise you $2000. Guys, you do what you like. That's a lot of money. I'm staying in. He's trying to buy his way out of his bluff. - Josh? - Two. Thattagirl.

Come on, real quick. - God, I'm bored. - You look bored. How was the clink? You get the cookies I sent? Why do you think I came to see you first? - So tell me. - It's tricky. It's never been done before. It'll need planning and a large crew. - Guns? - Not quite. High security. The take... - The target? - Eight figures. What's the target? When was the last time you were in Vegas? You want to knock over a casino? The vault at the Bellagio. If I'm reading this right, and I'd like to think I am... ...this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed. You said three casinos? These feed into the Mirage and MGM Grand, but every dime ends up there. The Bellagio and the Mirage. - These are Terry Benedict's places. - Yes, they are. - Think he'll mind? - More than somewhat. You'd need at least 12 guys doing a combination of cons. Like what, you think? Off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown... ...a Miss Daisy and a Leon Spinks. Not to mention the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever. Where will you get the money to back this? Hit these three casinos, we'll get our bankroll. Benedict's got a list of enemies. But enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose? - Reuben. - Reuben. Hey. Oscar, lower it a bit, would you? Sorry. You guys done? Find what you want? We'll take these for the night to make copies. - Whatever you need. - Appreciate it. What? I need a reason. And don't say money. Why do this? Why not do it? I just left the joint after losing four years of my life... ...and you're cold-decking Teen Beat cover boys. Because the house always wins. Play long enough, the house takes you. Unless, when that perfect hand comes, you bet big. Then you take the house. - You practiced that speech? - Did I rush it? It was good. The Teen Beat thing was harsh. I wonder what Reuben will say. You're out of your damn minds! You're both of you nuts! I know more about casino security than any man. I invented it. And it cannot be beaten. They got cameras and watchers, they got locks. They got timers, vaults. They got enough armed personnel to occupy Paris! Okay, bad example. It's never been tried. It's been tried. A few guys even came close. You know the three most successful robberies in Vegas? Number three, the bronze medal. Pencil neck grabs a lockbox at the Horseshoe. Grab the guy in the suit! He got two steps closer to the door than anyone before. Leave the money! Second most successful robbery: The Flamingo in '71. This guy actually tasted fresh oxygen... ...before they grabbed him. Of course, he was breathing out of a hose for the next three weeks. Goddamn hippie. And the closest any man has come to robbing a Las Vegas casino... ...was outside of Caesars in '87. He came... ...he grabbed... ...they conquered. But what am I saying? You guys are pros. The best. I'm sure you can make it out of the casino. Of course, lest we forget... ...once you're out, you're still in the middle of the fucking desert! You're right. He's right. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. - That's what it is. Ego. - Yeah, blah, blah. - Thanks for lunch. - The nicoise was delicious. - Sorry to bother you. - Look, we go way back... ...and I owe you from the thing with the guy. - Our pleasure. - I'd never been to Belize. Give Dominic your addresses. I got some furniture to send you. Just out of curiosity, which casinos did you geniuses pick to rob? The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. Those are Terry Benedict's casinos. - Is that right? - That's right. You guys... ...what do you got against Terry Benedict? What do you have against him? That's the question. He torpedoed my casino. Muscled me out. Now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way for some monstrosity. - I see what you're doing. - What are we doing? If you're gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you better goddamn know. This used to be civilized. You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you. But Benedict... At the end of it, he'd better not know you're involved. Because he'll kill you, then he'll go to work on you. That's why we have to be very careful, very precise. Well-funded. You gotta be nuts, too. And you're gonna need a crew as nuts as you are. Who do you got in mind? - All right, who 's in? - Frank C. Is in. Frank has bronchitis and is applying for a transfer to warmer climates. Drivers? - I talked to the Malloys. - Mormon twins? They're in Utah, off the job. They're having trouble filling the hours. - Waiting, sweetheart. - Good. Go. - Waiting for you. - Why? - You're a little girl! - Relax. I'm going to get out and drop you like third-period French. Relax. - Electronics? - Livingston Dell. He's been doing surveillance work for the FBI mob squad. - How are his nerves? - Not so bad. Move in a little bit. - Don't touch that. - Why not? Do you see me grabbing your gun and waving it around? Hey, RadioShack. Relax. Munitions. - Phil Turrentine. - Dead. - No shit. On the job? - Skin cancer. - You send flowers? - Dated his wife for a while. Basher's in town. There may be an issue with availability. All right, chaps... ...hang on to your knickers. Oh, leave it out! You tossers! You had one job to do! That's all you used in the event? - You accusing me of booby-trapping? - Well? Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style. Isn't that right? Basher? Peck. ATF. Let me venture a guess. Simple G-4 mainliner, back wound, quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet. Let me ask you this. You search this scumbag... ...for booby traps? I mean, really searched. Stand back. Here we go. - Find Griggs. I need him. - Who? Just find him, will you? Can you put something together with what I gave you? Done. - Is Danny about? - He's around the corner. Terrific. It'll be nice working with proper villains again. Everybody down! Get down! They weren't expecting that shit! - Nice work. - Thanks. - Which one's the Amazing Yen? - The little Chinese guy. - Who else is on the list? - He is the list. It doesn't seem that diff... - We got a grease man. - We got a grease man. We need Saul. - He got out of the game a year ago. - He get religion? Ulcers. - You could ask him. - Hey, I could ask him. I saw you at the paddock... ...before the second race, outside the men's room when I placed my bet. I saw you before you even got up this morning. - How you been, Saul? - Never better. What's with the orange? - My doctor says I need vitamins. - Why don't you take vitamins? You come here to give me a physical? Box seats. Come on. You gonna tell me? Or should I say no and get it over with? You're the best. You're in Cooperstown. What do you want? Nothing. I got a duplex now. I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish. I'm seeing a lady who works the counter at Macy's. I've changed. Guys like us don't change. We stay sharp or get sloppy. Quit conning me. That your hound way in the rear? He breaks late. Everyone knows this. You going to treat me like a grownup at least? Tell me what the scam is? Exhibit C: His belt as king of the heavyweight crown. Lennox Lewis has proven he's the champion. Saul makes 10. Ten should do it, don't you think? You think we need one more? You think we need one more. All right, we'll get one more. Hello, Linus. Whose is this? - Who are you? - A friend of Bobby Caldwell's. You're either in or out. Right now. - What is it? - It's a plane ticket. A job offer. - You're pretty trusting. - Bobby has faith in you. Fathers are like that. He didn't tell you? He doesn't want me trading on his name. Do this job, he'll be trading on yours. Don't, and you can go back to feeling up stockbrokers. Can you get the check, please? That's the best lift you've made yet. Las Vegas? America's playground. Did you guys get a group rate, or something? Saul, do you get out to Utah much? Not as often as I'd like. Check it out. I think you'd dig Provo. You could do well there. I'll look into it. Welcome to Las Vegas. Has everybody eaten? Good. Everybody sober? Close enough. Before we start, nobody's on the line yet. What I'm about to propose is highly lucrative and highly dangerous. If that's not your brand of vodka... ...eat as much as you like and have a safe journey. No hard feelings. Otherwise, come with me. You're Bobby Caldwell's kid? - From Chicago? - Yeah. - You like it there? - Yeah. That's wonderful. Get in the goddamn house. The 3000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard... ...also known as the Bellagio, Mirage and MGM Grand. They're three of the most profitable casinos in Las Vegas. This is the Bellagio vault, located... ...beneath 200 feet of solid earth. It safeguards every dime that passes through each of the three casinos. - We're gonna rob it. - Smash-and-grab job? Slightly more complicated than that. Well, yeah. This is courtesy of Frank Catton, a new dealer at the Bellagio. Bad news first. This place houses a security system rivaling most nuclear silos. First, we have to get in the casino cages, which takes more than a smile. Next, through these doors... ...each one requiring a different code changed every 12 hours. Past those, the elevator. Here's where it gets tricky. - It won't move without fingerprint I.D. - Which we can't fake. And vocal confirmation from the system within the Bellagio and the vault. Which we won't get. The elevator shaft is rigged with sensors. If we override the lift, the exit would lock and we'd be trapped. Once we get down the shaft, it's a piece of cake. Just two more guards with Uzis... ...and the most elaborate vault door ever conceived. Any questions? Tunneling's out. There are... ...sensors monitoring the ground. If a groundhog nested, they'd know. - Anyone else? - You mentioned good news? Yeah. The Nevada Gaming Commission requires... ...a casino to keep enough cash to cover every chip on the floor. That means on a weekday, by law, it must carry... ...between $60 and $ 70 million in cash and coin. On the weekend, between 80 and 90 million. On a fight night... ...in two weeks, the night we're robbing it... ...$ 150 million, without breaking a sweat. There are 11 of us, each with an equal share. You do the math. Exactly. I have a question. Say we get into the cage and through the security doors... ...down the elevator we can't move... ...past the guards with the guns, into the vault we can't open... - Without being seen by cameras. - Sorry, I forgot to mention that. Yeah, well, say we do all that... ...we're just supposed to walk out of there with $ 150 million... ...without getting stopped? Yeah. Oh. Okay. First task: Reconnaissance. I want to know what goes on... ... in all casinos, from the dealers ' rotation... ... to the path of cash carts. I want to know everything about every guard. Find out where they're from, nicknames, how they take their coffee. She dances at Crazy Horse Too, to pay for school. - I think she really likes me. - Cool. Know these casinos. They were built to keep people in. Know the quick routes out. - He went through at 10:44. - 10:46. Get a watch that works. - You make me sick, dude. It's 10:44. Second task: Power. Fight night, we throw the switch on Sin City. It's Basher's show. You want broke, blind or bedlam? - How about all three? - Right, it's done. Third task: Surveillance. Security has an eye and an ear on everything. We want an eye and ear on them. Livingston? Not the least accessible system I've seen, but close. - There's no closed-circuit I can tap? - No. Then it's definitely a black bag job. They employ an in-house technician? Two. And one of them is lonely. Thanks, Charmaine. I'll return it in an hour. - Say hi to your mom for me. - Say it yourself. She's on-stage soon. Watch it, bud! - You call me bud, pal? - You call me pal, friend? - You call me friend, jackass? - Don't call me jackass. 433, we have a visual impairment on the northwest 052 exit-door camera. Copy that. I see them. - Is that a word? You made that up? - ""Obsequious"" is a word. - Please move your balloons. - You got in my way! - I was trying to deliver my balloons! - Gentlemen! - He's a balloon boy! Balloon boy! - You're spitting in my face. And we're up and running. - Why are hallways always that color? - They say taupe is very soothing. - Hi. - Fine, thanks. - Move the balloons. - Move them? I have a client waiting for these. I don't have time to fool around with you circus animals. Hey! Hold up a minute! Excuse me! Hey! Excuse me! - Hey, you dropped this. - Oh, thank you. - How's the reception on those things? - Excellent. - Take care. - Thanks. - Well... - Yeah. Fourth task: Construction. We need to build an exact replica of the Bellagio vault. - To practice? - Something like that. Fifth task: Intelligence. We need those codes, Linus, from the guy who has all three. - Who, Benedict? - Learn to love his shadow. - All I get to do is watch the guy? - Gotta walk before you crawl. - Reverse that. - Sixth task: Transport. Well, I am sorry, but $ 18,500 a piece is the best offer that I can make. Well, I understand. - They are some great-looking vans. - Yes, sir, top of the line. - Okay. Thank you for your time, Mr...? - Denham. Billy Tim Denham. - Denham like a jean. - That's it. Just like the jean. Man, you got some lovely hands here. Do you moisturize? - I'm sorry? - I've tried lots of lotion. I even went fragrance-free for a year. Now my sister... ...she uses aloe vera with a little sunscreen in it. Ideally, we all should wear gloves to bed... ...but I found there was interference with my social agenda, you know. Plus, I react to the camphor. So I'm not into the traditional remedies. Let me tell you something. If you could pay cash... ...I could drop that down to seven... Sixteen each. - No? - Yes, sir. - You'd do that? - Yes, sir. That'd be lovely. They told me to see you. - Well, I'm glad they did. - They told me. Well, let me go get the paperwork. You just wait here at the table. - You do that. - Thank you. - Very nice material. - It's imported silk, Saul. It's very nice. Gentlemen, would you excuse us for a second? Saul, you sure you're ready to do this? If you ever ask me that question again, Daniel... ...you won't wake up the following morning. He's ready. My name is Lyman. Zerga. My name is Lyman Zerga. My name is Lyman Zerga. Okay, tell me about Benedict. That guy's a machine. Good afternoon. He arrives at the Bellagio every day at 2 p.m. How are you, Tommy? He remembers every valet's name. Not bad for a guy worth 3/4 of a billion. He works hard, hits the lobby floor at 7 on the nose. - Good evening, sir. - How are you? - Talks with his casino manager. - About what? All business. Benedict likes to know what's going on. Be in control. There's rarely an incident he doesn 't know about or handle personally. Spends a few minutes glad-handing the high rollers. He speaks Spanish, German and Italian and is getting good at Japanese. He's out by 7:30 and is handed a black portfolio. Contents: Profits and new security codes. He heads to the restaurant. Like I said, a machine. That portfolio contains codes to all the cage doors? And two minutes after they're changed, he's got them. You guys really can pick them. This guy's as smart as he is ruthless. Last guy he caught cheating, he not only sent up for 10 years... ...he seized his house and bankrupted his... In-law's dealership. He takes out your knees and ruins your life and anybody you know. You scared? You suicidal? Only in the morning. - Now what? - Now comes the girl. She comes down after him if they're in a snit. - Where does she come from? - The museum, there. She's the curator. Here she is. This is the best part of my day. I'm not sure we can use her yet. I haven't even caught her name. Tess. Huh? Her name is Tess. - We have to talk. Now. - Okay. Tell me this is not about her or I walk off the job. Who? Tess. Benedict. Tell me this isn't about... ...the guy who's screwing your wife. - Ex-wife. - Tell me. - It's not about that. It's not entirely about that. Remember when we got in this business? We said we'd play like we had nothing to lose. Well, I lost something. I lost someone. That's why I'm here. The problem is, now we're stealing two things. And if you can't have both, which do you choose? Remember, Tess does not split 11 ways. If everything goes to plan, I won't be the one that has to make that choice. - How did she look? - She looked good. Thanks. You like it? I like that you like it. - I'll see you tonight? - Okay. In my hotel, there's always somebody watching. I'll see you tonight. Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga? I don't believe in weakness. It costs too much. I don't believe in questions either. Oh, really? Well then, let me give you a tip. Don't get into Terry Benedict for too much money. He doesn't fool around. - How are you, Eddie? - Fine, sir. Anything for me? Mr. Lyman Zerga. Third position. Wants to talk to you privately. Who is he? Businessman of some kind, from Europe. Very vague. I asked around. Word is, he deals primarily in arms. - One of the biggest. - Zerga. Yes, sir. - Never heard of him. - That's why I don't doubt it. - He's staying here? - He's in the Mirador suite. - How's he doing? - Up, almost 200. Good for him. You're 30 seconds late. I was about to send out a search... Hello, Tess. What are you doing here? I'm out. - Out? - Of prison. Remember? I went for cigarettes and didn't come back. I don't smoke. Don't sit. - They say I paid my debt to society. - Funny, I never got a check. You're not wearing your ring. I don't have a husband, or didn't you get the papers? - My last day inside. - I told you I'd write. - Danny, go now before... - What? Benedict? How you doing? Whiskey and whiskey. You're doing a great job at the museum. The Vermeer is quite good. - Vibrant. But his work fell off later. - Remind you of anyone? I always confuse Monet and Manet. Which one married his mistress? - Monet. - And Manet had syphilis. They also painted occasionally. All right, I'll make this quick. I came here for you. I want to get on with my life. I want you with me. You're a thief and a liar. I lied about being a thief. I don't do that now. - Steal? - Lie. Terry doesn't have to make the distinction. He's clear on both. - You have a problem. - Only one? You've met too many people like you. I'm with Terry now. Does he make you laugh? He doesn't make me cry. - The fight is Saturday night? - Yes, would you like tickets? No. Hand-to-hand combat does not interest me. I have a package arriving here that evening. A black briefcase, standard size... ...the contents of which is very valuable to me. I'll put it in the house safe. The house safe is for brandy and grandmother's pearls. - I need something more secure. - Mr. Zerga, I can assure you our... I can assure you, Mr. Benedict, that your generosity in this matter... ...will not go overlooked. Now, what can you offer me besides the safe? People you steal from have insurance. They get made whole again. I had to leave New York to escape. How do I get my five years back? - What you can do is not throw... - You don't know anything. You don't love me, you want someone else. - I must live with that. But not him. - Spoken like a true ex-husband. - I'm not joking. - I'm not laughing. There's a conflict of interest when you give me love advice. Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong. Do you remember what I said when we first met? - That I better know what I'm doing. - Do you? Now? You should go if you don't. - I know what I'm doing. - What are you doing? Just catching up. - Meet my ex-husband. - Danny Ocean. - Mr. Ocean. - I'm in your seat. Forgive my lateness. A guest required my attention. That's fine. Danny was walking through and spotted me. - Is that so? - Imagine the odds. Of all the gin joints in all the world. You recently were released from prison? That's right. - How does it feel to be out? - About the same. - Danny was just about to... - I just stopped by to say hi to Tess. Stay, have a drink. - I can't. - He can't. Well, then... I imagine we won't see Mr. Ocean anytime soon. You never know. I know everything happening in my hotels. So I should put those towels back. No, the towels you can keep. - Good to see you, Tess. - Take care, Danny. - Terry. - Danny. Stinking... Tomorrow the day is yours. Call is at 5:30, makeup and costume. Saul's package arrives at 7:05. Linus grabs our codes. All goes well, we're a go. At 7:30, Yen is locked in and we're committed. From this point, we have 30 minutes to blow the power or he suffocates. Once the electricity goes, access to the vault... ... and its elevator shut down for two minutes. That's when we go. You're in the middle of the room, 10 feet from everything. You have to get to the door without touching the floor. What do you do? - Ten says he shorts it. - Twenty. Window or aisle, boys? Yeah, we're in deep shit. That poxy demo crew didn't back the main line. They naused up the mainframe. Naused it up! - You understand him? - I'll explain later. They're so pony they blew the backup grids one by one. Basher, what happened? They did what I would have done but by accident. Now they know their weakness, they're fixing it. So unless we intend to do this job in Reno, we're in Barney. Barney Rubble. Trouble! - We could always... - By tomorrow? Hang on a minute, hang on. We could use a pinch. What's a pinch? A device which creates a cardiac arrest for broadband circuitry. Better yet, a pinch is a bomb without the bomb. When a nuclear weapon detonates, its electromagnetic pulse... ...shuts down any power source within its blast radius. It usually doesn't matter because a nuclear weapon destroys everything. A pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse... ...without mass destruction and death. Instead of Hiroshima you get... ...the 17th century. - How long? 30 seconds. Could a pinch knock out the power of an entire city? - Like, for instance... - Las Vegas? Yeah, I think it might. There's only one pinch big enough to do it. Where? Let's go. Yen, Basher, come on. Where you going? - I'm coming with you. - No. Oh, no, no, no! Don't leave me with these guys! Start. - I got one. - You thinking of one? - No, I've thought of one. - You're thinking of one. No, I'm done. I have it. - You a man? - Yes. 19. - You alive? - Yes. 18. - Evel Knievel. - Shit! - Don't touch me. - I'm not. - Your hand's in my face. - It's not. - Am I touching you? - Your hand's in my face. - Move. - I didn't touch you. - You just touched me. - You made me touch you. This is your side. This is your side. Get off. Get off. I'm gonna need a score of car batteries... Where's Linus? Where's Linus?! - There he is. - Oh, would you look at this doughnut? Should someone help him? That's a great idea, Albert. Let's all get nicked. Back it up. Let him in. You stupid bastard! - I say stay, you stay. - Got it. Lose focus for one second, somebody gets hurt! I got it. Where are they? That's what I want to know. Where the hell are they? - They will be here. - ""They will be here."" Schmuck! You boys have a nice trip? We have a problem. You've been red-flagged. The moment you enter the casino, they'll be watching. Like hawks. Hawks with video cameras. That's a problem. - Saul, turn that off. - When I'm ready... - Saul! - It's off! It's off! Any idea how this happened? - No. - Oh, come on. He's been chasing Benedict's girl. They had an argument two nights ago. - I tailed you. - Who told you to? I did. I worried you couldn't leave Tess alone. - Tess? - My wife. - Ex-wife. - Tess is here? I'm sorry. I didn't know if it would sting you, but it did. - You're out, Danny. - He's out? Or we call it off. His involvement puts us at risk. - It's not your call. - You put her before us and made it mine. This is my job. Not anymore. He can't just be out. Who's gonna trigger the vault? Kid, you up for it? I can do it. Done. Locate the others. Tell them the change in plan. Curtain goes up at 7. Tess is with Benedict now? She's too tall for him. Yes. No. Very much no. Then inform Mr. Levin he'll be better off watching the fight at home on TV. Surely, he must have HBO. That's it. Hi. What were you thinking about? You. Where you gonna put your hands? No good. Don't touch your tie. Look at me. You need to answer my question. Where do you look? No. Look down, they know you're lying. Up, and you don't know the truth. Don't use seven words if four will do. Be specific, but not memorable. Be funny, but don't make him laugh. He's got to like you, then forget you once you leave. And, for God's sake, whatever you do, don't... Russ! Can you take a look at this? Sure. Saul? It's time. Okay. Let's do it. On a perfectly clear night in Las Vegas... ... with the expected crowd of celebrities and sports fans... ... piling into the MGM Grand, the two best heavyweights in the world... ... prepare to meet after an eight-month dance toward each other. Mr. Zerga? Mr. Benedict. - I'm very busy. Are we on schedule? - I have no reason to suspect otherwise. My courier should be here momentarily. Eighteen. Blackjack! Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean is in the west slots. I can't have private security personnel in the casino cages. Of course not. Saul! Saul Bloom, is that you? Saul! Saul, it's me! Bucky Buchanan! Remember? From Saratoga! Mikael. Vladimir. Hey! Hey, Saul! Mr. Benedict, please. I have never enjoyed the touch of steel to my skin. Lift them up, please. I acknowledge your briefcase contains nothing dangerous or illicit. I agree to take said briefcase and store it in my vault... ...for a period of 24 hours. - I cannot allow you into the vault. - Why not? Insurance, for one. Security. Most of all, I just don't trust you. Excuse me. I put two plainclothes on Ocean. He's in the keno bar now. Mr. Zerga, this is my casino manager, Mr. Walsh. He will have your briefcase stored in our vault while you watch. Those are my terms. Yes or no? You leave me no choice. Dude, don't do that in front of the pinch. Deep breaths. You'll do fine. - Thank you. - No sweat. You're a natural. But don 't screw up. - Who gets the penne? - Right here. You ready? This is our security center, where we oversee the casino and vault. You'll monitor your briefcase from here. Don't let me keep you. - Mr. Zerga. - Mr. Benedict. Linus, you're up. Got him. Mr. Benedict. Sheldon Willis, Nevada Gaming Commission. I need two minutes of your time. - Anything for the NGC. - Thanks. Will you accompany me to pit five, please? - You make the deposit when? - At your signal. What do we look like, a couple of peckerwood jackasses? How does that feel? You all right? Want something to read? A magazine? All right. Counting down. Thirty minutes of breathing time starts now. This just came to our attention today. Apparently, he's got a record longer than my... It's long. If he is who you say he is. You been at the commission long? - About 18 months. - You know Hal Lindley? Worked with him? Not since he died last year. Ramn Escalante? Sheldon Willis, Nevada Gaming Commission. What's going on here? - It's come to our attention... - We should speak off the floor. Charlie. Thank you. - No. I want you out of here. - Give me one moment. - I've had it. I want you gone. - Tess, come here. You're up to something. Don't say you're here for me. You're pulling a job, aren't you? Well, no matter what it is, you won't win me back. Tess, I just came to say goodbye. Goodbye. You be good. - Mr. Ocean. - Mr. Benedict wishes to see you. I thought he might. Good afternoon, Mr. Escalante. Or should I call you Mr. Catton? You're Frank Catton, of the Tropicana, the Desert Inn... ...and the New York state penitentiary system. Are you not? I take it from your silence you won't refute that. Mr. Benedict, you're employing an ex-convict. As you know... Goddamn cracker. - Excuse me? - You heard me. Black man can't earn a decent wage? - You wanna throw me on the street. - I'm doing my job. Want me to get on the table and dance? Shine your shoes? Smile at you? You sure won't let me deal the cards. You might as well call it whitejack! I don't know what to say to that. Race has nothing to do with it. - Yeah, right. - What a horrible thing to say! You, of all people, know the NGC has always supported hiring colored... - No! I didn't mean it! - Okay. Come on, sit down. - Sit down. - You better talk to him. - He's got it. - Sit down. Virgil. Turk. Deliver the package. - Where's your card? - I lost it. - You serious? - I'm so stupid. - You are so stupid! You know that? - Hey! You think it helps to call someone names who's upset? - Hey! Keep it down. - Sorry. Sorry. - Where did this come from? - High roller's room. - It's Mr. Benedict's stuff. - Joe, take this inside. - Count room? - No, to the vault. Benedict's money goes in the vault. Next time, remember the card, and we won't run into this again. - Stupid. - Jeez! Yo! Hold that, please. - There's your briefcase now, Mr. Zerga. - Wonderful. That's my cue. Give Basher the go. Bash, what's your status? - Bash! - Easy. No need to shout, guv'nor. - What's your status? - I'm nearly there. Come on, come on. Mr. Walsh, show this man off the premises. Don't ever set foot in my casino again. Sir? - Cracker! - Oh, dear God! Oh! I forgot my pager. I left it. Sorry. - Know the way back? - I do. Good. Okay. Enjoy the fight. Sorry! How much longer you figure Mr. Benedict's gonna be? No cameras in this room, huh? Yeah. Don't want anybody seeing what goes on in here. He's not coming, is he? We're gonna step outside. Leave you to talk things over. I hadn't seen my wife in three weeks, so I decided to call her. ""I love you, you love me."" ""I miss you, you miss me."" That went well, but then I went to this party... I show up at 1 p.m. She expected me at 11 a. M... ...so she was going crazy. I said, ""What do you expect? What do you think goes on? It's not choir practice."" Oh, shit. Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga? I am very satisfied. - Are you all right, sir? - I'm fine. I'm fine. All right. Jesus! Bruiser! - Not until later! - Sorry, Danny. I forgot. It's all right. - How's your wife? - Pregnant again. Well, it happens. Let's get started. Come here. - You're almost there, Linus. - Who's that guy? - I got a bogey in west corridor. - Mr. Zerga! - Call a doctor! Mr. Zerga! - Put this under his head. Going to video now. - To the Eye in the Sky ASAP. We have a man down who's unconscious. Oh, Jesus! - Did you really think I'd sit this out? - You didn't trust me? I do now. Come on. Someone call for a doctor? - How'd you get here? - Had to give a friend two million. But what about Rusty? The argument? I mean, what was that about? Come on. Why not just tell me? Why put me through all this? Where's the fun in that? Let's get going. Come on, man! Breathe! Breathe, damn it! Breathe! I'm sorry. We've lost him. - Dude, I told you to hurry. - Don't do that. Just don't. I didn't tell you to hurry? Come on, get up! Get up! Had enough yet? - These things will hold us, right? - They should. Livingston, we're set. - Livingston, we're set. - Basher, we're set. Hang on a minute, chief. We don 't have one. Yen 's gonna suffocate. Well, then you better leave off bothering me, don't you think? All right, crack them. Go. Shit! Cut it. Hey! Pit six, table five. Dealers compromised. Trade's breached at tables three, five, six and ten. Get your coat. Get your coat. Look, this is crazy! What...? Not yet. Not yet. Go ahead. - You think Yen made it out okay? - I'm sure he'll be fine. How we doing? Okay, I guess. There's a 95-pound Chinese man with $ 160 million behind this door. - Let's get him out. - Yeah. - 10 cents he shorts it. - No bet. Try him again. Okay. Hey. Where we at, boys? - Pins and floor sensors, now. - Blinding. Here we go. Counting down from 20. Now. Twenty. - Don't blow the door. Can you read me? - Ten... ...nine, eight... - Maybe the pinch blew out his earwigs. - Do not blow the door! ...two, one. What's wrong? Something... Did you check the batteries? You know, lose focus in this game for one second... I know, somebody gets hurt. You don't hear Yen complaining. Yen? Where the fuck you been? - Sorry. - Sorry. That is the sexiest thing I have ever seen. Rusty, you're up. - You gonna answer that? - I don't have a cell phone. This isn't mine. See who it is. - Hello? - May I have a word with Mr. Benedict? It's for you. - Who the hell is this? - The man who 's robbing you. - What's going on in the vault? - Nothing, sir. It's all normal. Show me. - You're mistaken. - Watching your monitors? Okay, keep watching. In this town, luck can change that quickly. - Find out how much money's down there. - Yes, sir. Tess? Tess? Perhaps you should... Perhaps I should what? It would be better if you weren't around here for this. All right, you proved your point. You broke into my vault. Congratulations. You're a dead man. - Maybe. - Maybe? May I ask how you will leave? You think I'll let you take my money out my casino doors? - No. You'll carry it out for us. - Why would I do that? Look at your monitor. As your manager's probably reporting, you have over $ 160 million... ... in your vault tonight. We're only packing up half that. The other half we're leaving, booby-trapped, as a hostage. You let our $80 million go, and you get to keep yours. You try and stop us, we'll blow both cashloads. You can lose $80 million secretly or lose $ 160 million publicly. Your decision. Hi. Make the call. 911 emergency response. - Where's Danny? - He's fine. He's in good form. - He asks that you go up and watch TV. - He does? We have three men with explosives who have taken control of our vault. - Okay. - It's okay. - You have a deal. - I promise. Fantastic. Here's what you do: The guys in the vault will put six bags in the elevator. It will rise to your cages. Three of your guards will carry the bags into the casino. If they take more than 20 seconds to reach the floor, or there's a switch... ...we'll blow all the money. - He's in the casino by the slots. - Of course I am. I'm staying in your hotel. I have two words for you: Mini bar. Once the guards hit the casino floor... ... a white van will pull up outside. Your guards will load the rear. If anyone so much as approaches the driver's door, we'll blow everything. When I hear the van is away and the money is secure, my men will leave. Once their safety is confirmed, you get your vault. The S.W.A.T. Team is here. All right. Now, I have complied with your every request. Would you agree? I would. Good. Because now I have one of my own: Run and hide, asshole. Run and hide. If you're picked up buying a $ 100,000 sports car in Newport Beach... ...I'll be disappointed. I want my people to find you, and when they do... ...rest assured, we won't hand you over to the police. So, my advice to you again is this: Run and hide. That is all that I ask. Mr. Benedict, our guys say that van is headed for McCarran Airport. I want my vault back before that van hits the tarmac. Night goggles on. Prepare to cut power. Ready. Cutting power now. Do it. Breaching elevator doors now. We have two guards, bound, unconscious. Wait a minute. Guys! Guys! Someone's here! - Take him down, now! - I got him! - Lights! We need power now! - Give it to him. What's going on? Talk to me. It appears an explosive incendiary device has been detonated. Continuing search for survivors. Tell them to take the van. I'll be there. And find out how they hooked into my system! Yes, sir. Get out of the van, now. Now! Tires. Tires. Our search yielded no suspects. Nor can we determine how they entered or exited the premises. - Take your men out. - May I suggest...? Now. It's your vault. Blue team, move it out! Walsh, where are we with the van? I just want to try something for a second. There's nobody inside. - I'm sorry. Did you want to get in? - Enough monkey business. Do it already. Mr. Benedict. We took the van, sir. And? They say there was no money in the bags, sir. What do you mean? They say the bags were filled with fliers, sir. For hookers. Walsh? Cue the tape to the robbery. Yes, sir. I'm looking at the tape now. Does it say ""Bellagio"" on the vault floor? No, it doesn't. I don't understand. We had it installed Tuesday. The images we saw of those men robbing us was a tape. What? It was staged. Somebody made a duplicate of my vault. What we saw on the monitor wasn't actually happening. I don 't understand. What happened to all that money? Make the call. 911 emergency response. - Night goggles on. - Clear. Prepare to cut power. Breaching elevator doors now. We have two guards, bound, unconscious. Wait a minute. Guys! Guys! Someone's here! - Take him down, now! - I got him! Open the door. Hey, Benedict. How's the other fight going? Pick him up. Did you have a hand in this? Did I have my hand in what? I'll ask you one more time. Did you have a hand in this? Benedict, I have no idea what you're talking about. Okay. You're free to go. Show him out. - Hello. - Turn to channel 88. Who is this? What happened, Benedict? You get robbed? Stop. I'll give you one last chance. Where's my money? What if I said you could get your money back... ... if you give up Tess? What would you say? I would say yes. All right. I know a guy. We were in the joint together. Anybody pulls a job in the Western U. S., he knows about it. Give me 72 hours, I'll find out who took your money. You know a guy. Contact the police. I'm sure he's in violation of his parole. Yes, sir. Tess. Tess. You of all people should know, Terry. In your hotel, there's always someone watching. Wait! Wait! Wait, that's my husband! - Danny. - Tess, I told you... ...I knew what I was doing. I didn't. All right, let's go. How long will you be? About three to six months, I guess. I hope you were the groom. Ted Nugent called. He wants his shirt back. Thirteen million and you drive this piece of shit to pick me up? I blew it all on the suit. - Where are they? - Back row, silver sedan. Ten o'clock. I picked up your personal effects. Hope you don't mind. I'm not sure these belong to me. - Hi. - Hi. Rusty needs a girl. There's a women's prison down the road. You said that you sold this. I said that. Liar. Thief. Subtitles by SDI Media Group , You're human. Please, just let me go. Given the extent of their physical degeneration, we think that you'll encounter minimal resistance. That's my sister. It's a trap. We're under attack. They must've cured themselves. He's one of them. I'm looking for someone. Professor Bill Ward. You've been gone for months. What did they do to you? You have to kill him. Mmm... He's creating a virus that will slaughter our people. You will die with us. You can stop it from happening. How? You have to kill him. Em, what's wrong? I can feel them. What do you mean? I can feel them. I feel their pain. It's okay. You're safe now. None of us are safe. How long have you been sitting with him? Most of the night. Has he said anything? I gave him the antibiotics. The equations in his notepad. I think they're important. More important than the lives of the people here? Hmm? Sophia? This will terminate the pregnancy in the first ten weeks. Okay. Have you told Nathan? No. It's better if he never knows. If there's anything else you need. Thank you. They'll never know they were human. It's better this way. If they knew, they'd grow up to hate us. Like we grew up to hate them? We lost some more of our people. - How many? - Six. We cure ourselves so we can die fighting them? We have no choice. We kill them, they kill us. Sometimes I think it will never end. It's different this time. Emily knows what she's got to do. What are you doing? I... I was looking for your mother. Right. Water. Water. Please. Thank you. The equations... What are they? They're formulas. To measure the collapse of the matter waves. This matter wave... Is it what we call wave particle duality? It's all around us. It's... It's only when we see them, that we call them objects or things. Only then are they part of space and time. We know of these collapses. We only partially understand them. It took us hundreds of years. Even now, transposing the matter waves is dangerous. You can control them? Can you move objects through space and time? Yes. We detected ripples in interstellar space, close to the edge of our solar system. Do you know what they were? They are the echoes of our transposition, our journey to Earth. But you came to Earth more than six months ago. Why are we only detecting these ripples now? The echoes travel at the speed of light. It took them longer to get here. Longer than you? Our journey took no time at all. Hey. You said you wanted to change things? It's not too late. What do you mean? How? How can you change it? You walk along the river and you join the other section here. He regained consciousness. Leave us. Did he say anything? He said their journey to Earth took no time at all. How is that possible? In the quantum world, photons and electrons can affect each other even if they're hundreds of miles apart. It happens in an instant. There's no travel, no communication, no time passes. Can they use this? I think they can move objects instantaneously across vast distances. I think it's how they got here. Catherine, how does it help us? I don't know. I don't know. He said we could change things. That it wasn't too late. If you can manipulate the world on a quantum level, then maybe anything is possible. Yeah, maybe. I know I shouldn't have given him the antibiotics. All I could think about was getting answers. That was more important to me than anything. How can you love someone who thinks like that? It's not easy. All I can tell you is that I do. Em? How're you doing? I'm okay. Mum has to stop herself from crying every time she looks at me. She was in pieces when you didn't come back. We thought you were dead. Maybe you should go and find Mum. You're angry with me for using the antibiotics. When someone else needs them, you can explain why you chose to save him. And then you can watch them die. There's someone out there. I asked for volunteers to clear the snow from around the service panels. Oh, no. Check the generator. Stay away from the windows! What's happening? Stay away from the windows! Theo! -  Catherine, down! - Theo? -  Get down, Sophia! Theo! Sophia, get down! - Theo! Theo? Sophia! Emily, get down! Theo? - Theo? No! - No! No! Theo! Sophia, get up! There's nothing you can do! Leave him! You have to leave him! Let's go! Quickly! Quickly! Nathan. Nathan! Let's go! Catherine! Got it! The service tunnel! Go! Come on, Sophia! Go! Go, go, go! Where's Theo? He's dead. Get out of here. Get out! Come on! Come on! No! Take them away. Take them away. Come on. Micah? Why did you have to do this? There has to be another way. There is no other way. It's us or them. It doesn't have to be like this. Did you tell them why you came here? They should know that it doesn't have to be like this. Where is the notebook? You cannot kill an idea. They won't ever understand it. Your ideas will die with you. You can kill your own brother? We cannot allow you to live. Please... Don't get old. I think the chances of that are extremely slim. My boyfriend was in the wine trade. Yeah? What happened to him? He died. In the attack? After. I tested Emily's DNA. - She let you? - I took a hair from her hairbrush. She shares some of the same mutations as the aliens. She... She's alien? - It's incredible. Her DNA is almost identical. The chances of that are... are billions to one. How is that even possible? I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. None of it makes any sense. Well, you said that if you had a live alien, you could start testing the virus. Seems to me like you've got one. You want me to test it on Emily? Could you? You're asking me to... to deliberately infect her? What would it do to her? Well, I'm developing RNA interferers that shut down the genes that cause insulin. She would fall into a diabetic coma and she would die. Well, maybe that's a price worth paying. I'm not gonna do it. How could I experiment on a 17-year-old girl? She's a child. This is it. This is what the end of humanity looks like. Drink up. Hello, Tom. - Hey. Couldn't sleep. Hmm. Who can these days? I think they've gone. You think it's weird that they look like us? What? Nothing. Pack up your things. We're leaving. Chloe? You okay? The tremor in Sacha's hand... It's come back. You can't be sure what it is. I mean, maybe he's just tired... No, no, no. It's the muscular dystrophy. And it's getting worse. Like his father. I can't bear it. Come here. Hey. How are you feeling? Everyone keeps asking me that. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say. You can sit down. Mmm, maybe don't wanna get too close. What do you mean? Everyone thinks I'm one of them. I don't think that. So... What's been going on with you these last few months? - Any good parties? No. - No good parties. Met any nice girls? You're seeing someone? I thought you were dead. I'm sorry. Kariem, honestly, it's fine. You're not jealous? Well, is... Is she prettier than me? No, I... You're joking. What happened to you on that ship? I know something is wrong. Whatever it is, you can tell me. Please. I want to help you. Sometimes, it feels like they're inside my head. I keep having these... thoughts. I'm so scared. Maybe you should talk to Bill. No. No. No, I don't think I should. I'll check upstairs. We just leave him up there? We don't bury him? It's too dangerous to go back. If he was here he'd tell us not to go. I'm sorry. I'll see if I can find some wood for a fire. I promised Theo I'd protect him. I told him I'd keep him safe... Sophia. Sophia. It's not your fault, okay? There's nothing you could have done. Get down! Get down! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Check them. Show me your wrists. Your wrists, let me see 'em. Take your bag off. I'm looking for my family. Do you know them? No. No way. Tom and Emily's dad? Are they still alive? Yeah. Yeah, they're here. They're here. They're inside. Sarah? Mate, she's with them. Are... Are you sure? You're sure... You're sure that that's them? Mate, I'm 100%. I've been with them since the start. Happy days. Sarah. Oh, my God. You're alive. Oh... Hi. Hi. Oh, Jesus. It's so good to see you. The kids? They're here. They're fine. We're okay. Dad? Tom. Hey, buddy. I thought you were dead. No. I never stopped looking for you. - Same hair. Em. It's me. It's your dad. I know. I can see you. You can help me if you like? What's going to happen now Jonathan has his family? What do you mean? Will he get back with his wife? I don't know. Let's just be grateful that he's found them. Everything will change now. Mom's telling him about me. It's okay. I know you think I'm one of them. Are you? No. What is it? It's Micah. He's dead. How? He died fighting for our people. I'm truly sorry. Jokim will bring his body here for burial. Was Jokim there when Micah died? Yes. He did everything he could. He couldn't save him. Sarah. Chloe? This is, erm... This is Chloe. We, erm, travelled through France together. Hi. Hi. This is Tom, Emily. My kids. Your dad talked to me about you. It's nice to finally meet you. Thank you for looking after him. I'm glad he found you. If you need anything, anything at all... Yeah, thank you. Uh, this is my son, Sacha. Hi. We'll, uh, let you settle in. - I'll show you where we're sleeping. - Yeah. What? I want the water, and I'll take your bag, too. Thank you. Nothing. We'll have to squeeze in another mattress. - Sarah... - I don't want Emily sleeping on her own. Not after everything she's been through. So she's in with us for now. Sarah... I'm with Chloe. We didn't mean for it to happen. I'm sorry. Oh... Oh, you thought I was dead, so... She's very pretty. How old is she? Sorry. Everything was so fucked up. I thought... I thought I lost you and the kids. I was going under, I was a mess. We just... We needed each other. - I'm sorry. - Don't. Things weren't exactly great between us. I've hated myself for that, every single day. Just go. This is the building. Right, go ahead. I'll keep watch. How do we find this Professor Bill Ward? We have to assume he's some kind of scientist. We'll start there. Look at the reference pages. What are they? At the back of the book, they list all the sources used for research. I miss the internet. He's creating a virus that will slaughter our people. You have to kill him. Emily? I won't let you kill them. Emily. What's going on? Jonathan's daughter, Emily. She tried to kill someone. Hello, Tom. I heard what Emily did. Oh, no. I'm fine. She tried to kill you. Yeah. Everyone's saying she's one of them. Is she? Yes. How can she be? She's my sister. None of it makes any sense. I'm sorry, Tom. What are they gonna do to her? I don't know. We don't have a choice. I'm sorry. I didn't know what I was doing. It's okay. It's okay. Look, uh... I'm gonna give you something to, uh... To help you sleep. Okay? Okay. What is it? It's, erm... It's just a mild sedative. Okay. I'm sorry. It's okay. Just... Just get some sleep, okay?, German bandits at two o'clock! Increase throttle! Power dive! Spell it right, Rafe. ""Rudder"" is spelled with two Ds. - Thanks, wingman. - Yeah, sure. Whoa, bandits! Crack shootin', Danny. Crack shootin', Rafe. - Land of the free. - Home of the brave. Great flyin',Dad! Come on. I'm gonna teach you how to fly. I get the front! No, you take the back. I'm bigger, and I should be in front. I'm older, and I'm teachin', so no. Wow. It's like we're really flying. Yeah, I did it lots of times. Come on, you man the guns. I'll give her some throttle. We gotta get those dirty German bandits. Oh, gosh! - Hang on! - Make it stop, Rafe! I've seen my dad do this lots of times. Don't worry! Rafe! Oh, my gosh! We're flying! We're flying! Whoa! Uhh! Wow. My dad's gonna kill me. Come on. Yes! Whoo-hoo! We flew! We flew! Yes! I'm a pilot! - I know! - Yeah! We flew. - You no-account boy! - Daddy- I done told you, you spend time playing... with this stupid boy can't read... you ain't never goin' to amount to nothin'! He ain't stupid, Daddy! Daddy! Ohh! Come on! Uhh! Get on back home. Now! Get on up. You got work to do. Come on! Come on, get on home! Uhh! You let him alone! Daddy, no! I will bust you open, you dirty German! What'd you call me? I fought the Germans in France. And I fought 'em in the trenches. And I pray to God no one ever has to see... the things that I saw. You're my bestfriend. Daddy, wait! Daddy, wait. Adolf Hitler... builds the German military machine... and drags all of Europe into war. But even while France falls to Hitler... America still refuses to join the fighting. - Where's McCawley and Walker? - Still training, sir. Alright, Danny. Now let's show 'em how to fly. We're gonna play chicken. You ready? This ain't the farm, and these ain't no cropdusters. I'm not playing chicken with you. Now don't be a baby. I'll tell you what- - I'm not doing it, Rafe. - Well, I'm coming right at you. You can turn, or you can hit me. It's up to you. What the- Oh, boy. Why you always bustin' my ass, Rafe? Which way you goin'? I guess I'll go right. No, uh, left. I'll go left. OK, we're goin' left, right? Ri-uh, right. Right? Right like we're goin' right, or right like we're goin' left? Well, now you got me all mixed up! I don't know. Make up your mind. God, Rafe, we're going right! Righty-tighty! Aah! - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo-hoo-hoo! Those are some smooth aces. Did you say something? 'Cause let me tell ya, those farm boys are grounded! Yes, sir, an entirely unacceptable use... of m-m-military aircraft, sir. - Get my hat. - Yes, sir. Get those hedge-hoppers in Doolittle's office. After two years of training... you believe that a $45,000 airplane... is there for your amusement? No, sir. I was just trying... to keep my edge, Major. And when you did the outside loop last week... what did you think that was? Honing your skills? That's not training, McCawley. That's a stunt. And I personally consider it to be reckless... and irresponsible. Major... How could that be, when you're famous... for being the first man in the world ever to do it? Don't get cute with me, son. No, sir, I don't mean to be disrespectful. I just think that- well, I- It is reckless and irresponsible... if you're just doing it to be a show-off. But I was doing it to try to inspire the men, sir... in the way that you've inspired me. I believe the French even have a word for that... when the men get together to honor their leaders. They call it an homage, sir. - A what? - An homage, sir. That's bullshit, McCawley! But it's very, very good bullshit. Thank you, sir. McCawley, you remind me of myself fifteen years ago. Which is why we need to discuss this. Have a seat, son. The British have accepted you into the Eagle Squadron. You're on your way to England tomorrow... if you still want to go. Huh. Wow. Just a few British pilots are all that stand... between Hitler and total victory in Europe. They're gonna need all the help they can get. Yes, sir. Well, I'm on my way. Just for the record... I'm supposed to ask you to reconsider. Sir? Sooner or later we're gonna be in this war... whether we like it or not. And I'm gonna need all of my best pilots. So it's my duty to ask you to stay. Major, what would you do? If it was me... I'd go. Get out. Am I going bald right back here? Ooh! Man, I am one good-lookin' son of a bitch. Don't you ever die. Die. That's exactly... the concept you gotta work tonight. You put a drop of this clove oil under your eyes... and you let 'em sting and well up. You get your nurse alone, take a breath... let her see your eyes glisten... and say, ""Baby, they're training me for war... ""and I don't know what'll happen... ""but if I die tomorrow, I want to know... ""that we lived all we could tonight. "" Come on, guys! We got nurses waitin'. Come on, before the rest of his hair falls out. How could you do this? Well, Doolittle assigned me. He wanted me to get some real- real combat training in. Well, guess what? It's not training over there. It's war. Where the losers die, and there aren't any winners- just guys who turn into broken-down wrecks... like my father. Yeah, I understand that, Danny. But I feel like I got a duty to go. Don't preach to me about duty, damn it. I wear the same uniform you do. Now, if trouble wants me, I'm ready for it. But why go looking for it? God, Danny, come on. I'm gonna be twenty-five. I might as well be an old man. They're gonna have me bein' a flight instructor. I don't wanna teach loops and barrel rolls. I wanna be a combat fighter. Hey, come on! The nurses can't d- d-dance by themselves. Let's go. If the call of duty means seeing 150 men... in their underwear every day... we are here to serve. I can't believe it. Saturday night in New York City. Do you know what they're doing where I come from? Nothing. Cow-tipping. Well, that's why you joined the Navy, hon'. To get out of that dusty little town and see the world. May I remind you, Barbara, we're Navy nurses, not tourists. I joined to do my patriotic duty and... to meet guys. Me, too. Girls, we're gonna have so much fun tonight in the city. You've gotta tell them the story, Evelyn. What? Oh, come on. Tell us. Oh, it's such a long story. We got time. I saw it happen. Well, it was about four weeks ago... What do you think is b-b-better? All in the one cheek, or spreading them out? OK. Fusco, Anthony. You all right, buddy? Sweetie, do you really have to do this? I'm not gonna get yellow fever in my barracks. No? If you'd rather, she can do it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just gimme a minute. Honey, the government says stick 'em, we stick 'em. Uh! Hey, Red, you alright? Eye exam number four? Listen, Doc, I have passed a dozen medical checks. You write that, they won't let me fly. Sorry, son. I'm gonna fail. They're gonna take my wings away. No, they won't. Just relax. Read the bottom line, please. Just keep practicin' the bottom line. And don't worry. I'm right behind you. J- L-M-K-P-O- Next. Ma'am. J- L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X. Eyes like an eagle, ma'am. Slow down, flyboy. And, instead of the bottom, read the very top. Both eyes. Yeah. ""C""- sorry, ""J."" Ahem. ""C""... - ""W."" - ""W."" - ""Q."" - Uh, ""Q."" Uh, ""'Q.""' Read the bottom line again, please. But read it right to left and every other letter. ""E."" Heh. ""'X.""' - X-E. - X-E. X- E, ma'am. Ma'am, I know how this looks. I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I really am. But Army and Navy requires 20/20 vision. Oh, i-it's-it's not a problem with my eyes. I mean, I can see. I mean, I can hit a running rabbit with a $3.00 pistol. I got a problem with letters, that's all. Well, maybe after some schooling... you could come back and take the test again. No, I had schooling. I mean, I-the teachers just never knew... what to make of it. It's just letters. I mix 'em up sometimes. That's all. I mean, I just get 'em backward sometimes. L- look here. Uh, my-my math and-and spacial reasoning... and my verbal scores are all excellent. But you barely passed the written exam. Yeah, but he did pass it. So, is it my turn now? - No, you'll wait your turn. - Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, I-I'm never gonna be an English teacher. But I know why I'm here. To be a pilot. And you don't dogfight with manuals. You don't fly with gauges. I mean, it's all about feeling and speed... and lettin' that plane become like a part... of your body. And that manual... says that a guy who's a slow reader can't be a good pilot. That file says I'm the best pilot in this room. Ma'am, please, don't take my wings. Well, I felt so bad. Evelyn, rotate to station three. I had no choice. I passed him. - Good. - Uh-huh. So, then this cocky pilot comes back. - Say, fella, are you enlisted? - Yeah. ""Yeah""? Boy, you're talking to an officer. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. - Give me that file. - Yes, sir. - Parade rest. - Yes, sir. Ma'am, I didn't get a chance to thank you. Drop your skivvies. Ah, oh, OK. Just like this? That's fine. He did have a very cute butt. You know, I know you didn't have to pass me... and you did. And I just- I didn't think you'd understand, and you did. You know, you still haven't said thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Why'd you do it? I mean, I'm just curious. You're like my hero now. Actually, my father was a pilot. And, um, I've seen first-hand what happens... when a pilot loses his wings. You know what? Your father's my hero, then, too. Infact, as an officer, I think it'd by my duty... to take my new hero's daughter out tonight... Just to-aah! Gosh, did I poke too deep? I think you hit the bone there. You are so mean. What? So is- is there any chance... that you might, kind of, sort of... you know, like me, or... Oh, how did you guess? They never taught us... how to deal with this... feeling. Wh-what feeling? Well, it's kind of like... this. Ow! Well, he was getting fresh, so I poked him again. All right, Romeo. I want to get this over with. Hold on a second. Miss... I really, really lick you. What did he mean? Like you. I didn't mean to say that. And I just, um... I just want to ask you, please, if I can donate dinner. He started to act very strange. Or, well, buy you dinner. This isn't your chart. Whoa. No. That's the, uh, this, uh, fellow over here's. I think he left. Have you already had this shot? Yeah, well, once... already. Well, I wanted- I mean, can I ask you out? No! And he just went wham! Unh! Oh! What'd you do to him? Poor guy. Hey! Oh, my God. Are you OK? Uh, yeah. I'm fine. I feel great. This is just standard precautionary... thing. Look, I got some, uh, genuine French champagne... from France. I thought, you know, maybe we could celebrate. Celebrate what? Oh, I don't know. Uh, well, you being my hero, for one. OK. Why not? So, uh, ahem... I wanted to thank you. And I just wanted to, uh... put your mind at ease about passing me... because I really do think you did this country a service. I mean, I'm- I am a great flier. And if you have a fault, which you obviously don't... it's modesty. No. If I have a fault, it's candor. You are just so- Uhh. Cork just got away from me. God, oh, it hurts. It hurts something fierce. I'm sorry. - Ohh... - Oh, it's bleeding. - God. - Oh! - Ohh! - Lay still. I ruined everything. - Lay still. - Oh, it hurts. - Ow! It's cold. - It'll stop the bleeding. Yeah. I can't breathe. Lay still. You are so beautiful it hurts. It's your nose that hurts. No. I think it's my heart. And then I kissed him. Oh, Evelyn. That's the most romantic story I ever heard. It's been the most romantic four weeks and two days of my life. Oh, I'm so jealous. Hello, Lieutenant. - It's good to see you. - You, too, Lieutenant. Pick a hand. It's beautiful. What's in your other hand? Mine. Well, it took me six hours to fold these. Oh! I want you to meet my friends. Rafe, this is Martha, Barbara, Sandra- - Hi. I'm Betty. - Hi. Would you happen to have any friends? Huh. Take your pick. Hi. Whoo! We ever get in this war and somethin' happens to me... I can't tell you how good it makes me feel to know... that someone as sweet as you will be there... to nurse me back to health. Good, but we're not in the war yet. - Ahem. - OK. That was a bad line. Hi. I'm-I'm Red. Red- S- s-s-s-strange. Heh heh. Your last name's Strange? Yeah. She's all yours, soldier. No. It-it's Winkle. Red is such a ladies' man. Do you always stutter? No. Only when I'm- She's totally buying it. - Nervous? - Yeah. Why can't I get something like that? Hello. Hi. Danny seems kind of shy around the girls. Tsk. It's not that he's shy. He's just, ahem... a little unsure of himself, you know. His old man used to run him down a lot. Get him in a plane, he's sure of himself. He's like my brother. He's like my best friend. He's my right hand. Which at the moment is a long way south of my waist. Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I lost a little altitude. Yeah, I guess you did. Excuse me. You and me, we got to talk. So, the rumor is the Navy's shipping us to Pearl Harbor. Well, won't be so bad. It's about as far from the fighting as you can get. You'll get a sun tan. So maybe the Army'll post you guys there, too. You... are a super special woman. And, and, well... Well, they're- they're training me... to be a big bad warrior, and, well... So, I mean, you never know what might happen tomorrow... or... or any day after that, you know? So... God, we need to make tonight super special. Why are you crying? I guess it's the thought... that I might not ever get to see you again. Dry your eyes, toots. Tonight, you're mine. I don't want to be with a crowd tonight. I just want to be alone with you. Well... How does New York Harbor by moonlight sound? Ohh! Heh heh! Are you gonna be a bad influence? Of course I'm a bad influence. Let's see if we can commandeer this vessel... 'cause we're, uh, officers of the U.S. Government. Not for long, we won't be. One day, we'll take a trip on a boat like that. Would you like that? We'll be dressing for cocktails and walk into the grandsalon. No one's talking about war. They're just dancing to Cole Porter. - I'll have to get a tux. - Yeah. Come on. There you go. All aboard. - You're out of your mind. - Oh, yeah. Careful now. Here, sit down. Now let's see here. Ah! There we go. See, this is as close as I could get you to your ship. So, at least I tried, right? Actually, you know what? This is better. Yeah, it is. God, you're pretty. What's gonna become of us all, Rafe? Well, the future's not exactly in our hands, is it? No. I guess you're right. - Aah! - Aah! Oh, my God! Are you all right? Yeah, are you? That was not part of the date. Watch your step. Oh, thank you. Evelyn! Guys, come up! Come on up! Come up! We're in 321. There's something I got to tell you. Well, you got no secrets from me, Lieutenant. I've seen your medical chart. Here we go. This can't be good, or it wouldn't be so hard to say. Yep. I got to go away. We're all going away. Yeah... but I'm going to the war... tomorrow. I'm flying with the Eagle Squadron. It's an outfit the British started for American pilots. I don't understand. You're in the U.S. Army. How could they order you to go? They didn't order me. I volunteered. Huh. But I passed you. I let you through. And now you volunteer... for the most dangerous place you could go? It's not your responsibility, not your choice. Flying's the only thing I ever wanted to do. I mean, everything in my life has led me up to this point. Meeting you. I love you. I love you so much. Let's go inside. All right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just-I-I can't do this. This just-it's not right. I'm sorry. I just- See, I can't do this. I mean, I mean, I can. I- I want to. I'm not trying to be noble, you know. Or not saying I know what would happen... or just- I need to stop talking. I just-I just don't want- I just don't want it to be like everybody else. I don't want you to have anything about tonight... that you regret. I mean, it's been the most incredible night of my life... and I don't want to ruin that. Oh, you couldn't ruin it. If I had one more night to live, I'd want to spend it with you. See, that's what I want to come home to. That's what I want to have to think about and dream about. I want to know that the best part of my life... is still ahead of me. Look. Don't, um... could you... not come see me off? Because, uh... saying good-bye to you once is hard enough. Here. Take this. Why? You think it looks good on me? I will come back. I thought you said you told her not to come. Yeah, I did. Why you looking for her then? It's my test. If I tell her not to come, and she comes anyway... then I-I know she loves me. All aboard! Track 57! If, uh, anything happens to me... I want you to be the one to tell her. All right? You just make sure and come back for the both of us, all right? OK. See you when I get back. Yeah. Good hunting, Rafe. Evelyn! Evelyn! Evelyn! Evelyn! Evelyn. Hey! She loves me. The German Luftwaffe... relentlessly bombards downtown London... while Churchill's Royal Air Force... is in a deadly struggle... to maintain control of the British skies. This is a real mess. Lieutenant McCawley reporting for duty, sir. Good. We'll get you settled into your quarters. And then introduce you to the crate you'll be flying. If y'all are patching up bullet holes here... maybe we ought to skip housekeeping... and get me in an airplane. Two didn't come back, sir. We counted only eleven. Are all Yanks as anxious as you... to get themselves killed, Pilot Officer? Not anxious to die, sir. Just anxious to matter. This is yours. Good chap. Didn't die till he'd landed and shut down his engine. Please be seated, gentlemen. I'm afraid I'm in a bad mood. Churchill and Stalin are asking me what I'm asking you. How long is America going to pretend... the world is not at war? We've increased food and oil shipments, Mr. President... and as far as I know- What they really need are tanks, planes... bullets, bombs, and men to fight. But our people think Hitler and his Nazi thugs... are Europe's problem. We have to do more. Send the Brits and Russians more of our ships... and anti-aircraft weapons. And keep cannibalizing the Pacific Fleet? What choice do we have? We're building refrigerators while our enemies build bombs. This is so exciting. You know there's about one hundred ships on Pearl. How many sailors per ship? It depends. More on a battleship than a sub. But say, on average... 2,000? Then there's the flyers, the marines, base personnel. I'm still working on the sailors. Girls, I think the odds are in your favor. Yeah, like 4,000 to one. It's paradise. See you on the beach, boys! We're in Hawaii! Hey! You're not supposed to paint titties... on the side of my airplanes. And if you do, don't make 'em lopsided. They were lopsided, Earl. Look, it says right here. ""Never ride waves amongst rocks or submerged pilings. "" See, it says you shouldn't do that. How do you know they're submerged if they're submerged? Gooz, what in the hell are you doing? Just trying to fix this surfboard thing. He keeps taking chunks off his nose on the rocks. On my day off, I'm working on my new invention- the Gooz Cruise Fin. I'm gonna be a rich fella. Every surfboard in the nation's gonna need one. Yeah? Well, you're gonna need a broom. Check out these new recruits. Hi. Aloha. Y'all pilots? We're working on it. It's a lot of switches and stuff. Pride of the Pacific. Who are you? Terrors of the skies. Welcome, ladies. Hi. I have to deal with toasty sun burnt fanny... before I can show you around. Ow! Dear Evelyn. It's different than I thought it would be here. It's cold- so cold it goes deep into your bones. There is one place I can go to find warmth. That is to think of you. I just wish I could be back there with you. It's not easy making friends. Two days ago, I had a beer... with a couple of the RAF pilots. Yesterday, both of them got killed. Dear Rafe. I miss you so much. It's so strange to be half a world away from you. I'm right on his tail! Got one! Every night I look at the sunset... and try to draw the last ounce of heat from its long day... and send it from my heart to yours. Family? Girl, sir. The girl. A lot of people frown on the Yanks... for not being in this war yet. I'd just like to say... if there are many more back home like you... God help anyone who goes to war with America. Atten-hut! Attention on deck! Admiral Kimmel... Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, on deck. Sharp presentation, Captain. Thank you, Admiral Kimmel. For four months now Washington's been blowing pink smoke... about the threat from Japan. Could make us lose our fighting edge. I'm determined not to let that happen. With your permission, Captain. Admiral, urgent, from Washington. I'm supposed to keep this fleet... battle-ready to take on the Japanese... cover half the damn globe. Now they want me to transfer... another twelve destroyers to the Atlantic. Don't they know what we're facing out here? They feel Europe is the greater danger. I'm assuming these risk assessments include Hawaii? Pearl Harbor is too shallow for an aerial torpedo attack. We're surrounded by sub nets. All we need worry about is sabotage... so we bunched our planes together... to make them easier to protect. Distance is our ally, Admiral. You analysts got it all figured out, don't you? The smart enemy hits you... exactly where you think you're safe. Incoming! I fixed the hydraulics and electrics, sir... but the oil hoses still need attention. Just crank it, Ian! God speed you, sir. Red section, take the bombers. Blue section, look out for the fighters. Bombers dead ahead. Let's drop in and give 'em a reception. Red Two, follow my lead, high side. Go right at the lead bomber. Following you, Red One. Good hit! Good hit! Red One, coming around, reset for the kill. I have the middle bomber. Hammer down! We got him. Nice shot, Red Two. I got two M.E.s dead ahead. I'm on him. I'm on his tail. Hammer down. I got one of them! I got another one. Red One, you got fighters all over your tail! I'm under fire! I'm taking fire! Red One, get out of there. Pull up! Pull up! Argh! I got an oil leak. Can't see a damn thing! I can't bail! My canopy's stuck! I can't bail out! He's on my tail, Red Two. I'm hit! I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! Oh, my God. I'm no good at church. What do you mean, sweetie? When I'm up there getting my slate wiped clean... I'm thinking how to dirty it up again. Wow, this from a virgin! I got to inventory supplies. Kill me now. Could you be any more boring? Don't bother. Sunday, she writes Rafe... ten pages instead of the usual five. Gosh, I wish I was in love. Hey, sweetheart. She hates me. Good to see you, Red. Good to see you, too, Betty. You wanna come for a ride? Come on. Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur. That-a-boy! Be a mad dog! You hit pretty hard... for a cook. All right, Walker, who you got? I'll take the cook. Why? You don't like money? Come on! Get out there now! - I'll put five on it. - Done. Against a mechanic? That guy craps rivets. How's it feel up from the engine room? Sunlight botherin' you? Ow. Man, he's getting all busted up! Move! Move! Come here, we gotta talk. Get down here. He can't hurt us. He can hurt us. - He cut us. We bleeding. - Bleeding? That's a scratch. See this? This is the hard-earned greenbacks... of every pot-scrubbin' chop in this fleet. Now if we don't win... Teeny here has to find another battleship! I'm not going back to the Arizona empty-handed. Don't worry about the money. I'll send that smug engine-fixin' snipe... back below decks where he belong. We the man! He slapped your mama! Be a son of a bitch! Look at this! All right, Dorie! That's enough. That's enough. - Oh! Where's my money? - Nah, fight's rigged. We're rich! Ha ha ha! How'd you get this? Boxing. Did you win? Yes, ma'am. What do you get for winning? Respect. So, why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect? I left my momma in Texas... and joined the Navy to see the world... become a man. They made me a cook. Not even that. I clean up after other sailors eat. Two years, they never even let me fire a weapon. Well, let's hope you never have to. Yes, ma'am. You take care, Petty Officer Miller. You, too, ma'am. You know, he taught me to fly. I always knew that no matter what trouble I got into... I'd never be in it alone. He'd be there with me. He was always pushing me to be better and faster. He told me you were a great flier. It was the same night he told me... he'd volunteered to go to England. Volunteered? He... he told me he'd been assigned. He was always trying to protect me. But you know what? I look at myself in the mirror in this uniform... and I still don't know who I am. I look like a hero... but I don't feel like it. Rafe... he always looked the part, didn't he? He couldn't wait to be one. To Rafe McCawley. The best pilot... and the best friend I ever knew... or ever will know. To Rafe. THUR Look at this. The Japanese... are flooding the Pacific with radio traffic. Everywhere from the Panama Canal to southeast Asia. There's no logical pattern, Captain. No. There's always logic. They know we read their mail. They're trying to make us think their fleet is moving south. I'm not buying it. Something, something's up. Otherwise, why would they take the trouble to bullshit me? Evelyn, I signed for these letters for you today. They're from England. They're from Rafe. I'm sorry, Ev. You know how long it takes mail to get here. Hurry up! Show time, boys! Come on! America still awaits Japan's response... to peace proposals. Ambassador Nomura arrives in Washington... in what could hopefully guarantee... continued peace in the Pacific. On the British front, Churchill declares... ""Give us the tools, and we will finish the job. "" The RAF has fought bravely against... Hitler's ambition to rule the skies over the Channel. Victory does not come without sacrifice. Evelyn! - Danny. - Hey. Some comedy, huh? Yeah. It's been a while. I've been logging a lot of flight hours. I kinda been avoiding you, too. Yeah. - Look- - Do you- Do you want to? Sure, yeah. I remember one time when I was... like, seven years old... I was always building gadgets and things. He wanted me to build him some wings... so he could fly like his daddy. I told him you can't fly without some kind of engine. But he wouldn't listen. ""Danny, never mind that, just build 'em anyway. "" So I did. And I'm up there... strapping these big ol' wings on his back... that we made from paper and glue... and these massive silk bloomers that we stole. He looked so stupid, and I told him... ""You can't jump off the barn in these. "" And bam! He busted his leg on a backhoe. God, I miss him. Yeah. But don't you think... that Rafe wasn't back up there next day. Cast and everything... telling me to make some adjustments on those wings. Check this out! Crossroads of the Pacific. Tahiti-1,700 miles! All right! Say, Betty... W- wou... - No, Betty! Get up! - What's going on, Red? - Stand up, please. - What do you mean? Just stand up. Stand... Oh! Ha! Betty... Red, come on! We got a dinner reservation. Can I get a minute? What's the matter, you sick? Can a guy propose?! Oh! Thank you! Am I talking too much? Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry. Hold up! Look at this. Hello! OK, let's get out of here. OK. I guess I should go. Don't let it be three months before I see you again. I had a good time. Yeah, me, too. Do you want me to walk you home? No, I'll be fine. No... of course. - Good night. - Good night. I was just wondering if maybe I could come by some time... get a cup of coffee or a piece of pie? What am I doing? OK. Oh! You were asleep. I'm sorry. Danny? Is something wrong? No! Nothing's wrong. No problem. Hi! It's just Danny. I... just... you... you forgot this. Oh... thanks. It was good of you to take the trouble... to drop it over... now. I... well, I thought you might need it. You know... maybe tomorrow morning. If... not that you wear this to work, but... No... it's a hankie. Right, right. Yeah. Listen, I was thinking maybe... I could come by some time... if I gave you a call, could I come by? Once, maybe... if you're not busy? Yeah, maybe. - Maybe? - Maybe. OK, all right. Thanks. Good-bye. Good night. You are such an idiot! Did you have fun last night? It wasn't how it looked. And if it was, it'd be all right. It's been months. It's time to move on. I am moving on. Ev, don't lie. All I know is, I hear you crying when you think I'm asleep. When my dad left... I was too much for my mom to handle... so she sent me to live with my aunt. I thought my life was over... But you don't know where it's all gonna lead. If I hadn't run away and lied about my age... and enlisted in the Navy... I wouldn't have met Red, and... now he's my fiance. Oh, God, I can't get used to that word. - It's only been twelve hours. - Oh, Betty! Little Betty beat us all to the post. And this is ward three. As you can see, no patients. Welcome to Hawaii. Come on, I'll show you the bar. Sandra, new recruits to torture. Come on. Excuse me, ladies? Hi! We're gonna wait two years until I'm nineteen... and Red can buy me a ring. Rafe sent his best friend to tell you... so you would be OK, so you can move on. You gotta go on living, Ev. Red! Whoo! Sorry! Bye, Rafe. The Japanese Fleet is missing. They're operating under radio silence. This footage was shot four days ago on October 28th. We're sending scout planes in wider vectors... all over the Pacific, but they get nothing. They could be anywhere in here. I don't understand how two whole carrier divisions... can just disappear. Clear! Aw, we're all over the page. We got one wall-eyed and one pigeon-toed. Anthony, tap in number six. All right. Gooz, tap in number three. All right. Hey. We got a visitor. Oh... that ain't no Navy issue uniform, eh? Danny, it's Evelyn. Jesus! You alright? Yeah. Yeah. No. I think I'm fallin' for her. Wow. You know, I saw this coming. I didn't want this to happen. It just kind of did. Can't help it. Well, Danny, she's gotta be with somebody. It might as well be you. You telling me if you were dead... and you saw your best buddy doin' your girl... you wouldn't come back and beat the living crap outta him? - Tony, back off. - I'd be back so fast. Danny's being a better friend taking care of her himself. I got a girlfriend. That's great. Come on, fellas. Let's split. Danny, whatever happens now is just about you and her. You gotta try and forget about Rafe. Be careful, alright? Ladies... cloud the mind. - Thanks, Gooz. - You're welcome. Hey, Danny. Where's everybody going? Just bein' discreet. Does it seem like everybody's acting a little strange? No. Nah. Right. Well, maybe-maybe a little. Yeah. Well, people in this outfit... have way too much time on their hands. Oh, yeah. I just hope they don't think there's been something... goin' on between us, that's all. Oh, no. I mean, no. That would be... embarrassing, right? Forgot my wrenches. That would definitely be embarrassing. Yeah. Ha. Forgot my wrenches. Hey. He really doesn't have to leave. No. I, uh, I'm just goin' out with the girls, so... I guess I'll see you later. - Yeah. - All right. Yeah, all right. I'll see you around. Shit. Evelyn. Have you ever seen Pearl Harbor at sunset? Of course. Well... from the air? You know, I could get kicked out of the military for this. - Really? - Yeah. Stay down. The Hawaiians called this harbor Wai Momi. It means ""water of pearls. "" It's so beautiful. My dad took me up a couple of times. Just don't do what he did. What do you call it when you flip over? A barrelroll? Yeah. I won't. Aah! - Oh! - Ha ha ha ha! - Oh, God. - What do you think? I like that. Hey! That plane was supposed to be back here an hour ago! Quick, hide in the parachute hangar. My heart is pounding. Danny, last night... No, that's terrible. Danny, we need to talk about this. Sir. Evelyn! - Danny. - Hey. Hi. Hi. I didn't sleep a wink last night. I had to see you. Last night was crazy, I know, but... I'm not sorry. Are you? I don't know. Danny, I had a wonderful time last night. I- It's just all too fast. Listen, Evelyn, I was just down at the beach this morning... and I watched the sun rise... and I knew that everything was gonna be different. That this was the start of something new. In this place, in this moment. And I don't care what anybody else says, you know? How can I not feel this way? I kinda like you. Oh, you do? You have your tie on crooked. Everything's gonna be all right, OK? Everything's gonna be all right. Do you have any airtours going through the valley of Oahu? You do? Aloha. This is KGMB in Honolulu... on another beautiful fall day here in paradise. We have enough information. We are returning home. Do you ever wonder... if this war's gonna catch up with us? Nota whole lot. Every moment we're not together, you're up there training for it. Yeah, well, I'm training for moments like these... 'cause I have no idea... how I'm gonna get this car out of the sand. Evelyn, can you please come out of the bathroom? You've been there for an hour. Evelyn! What are you trying to do, look like me? Are you OK? Yeah. What's the matter? No, you- D'oy. They call it the vacant sea. None of the major sea lanes go through it... and you can bury the entire land mass of Asia there... and nobody would know. From there, they could attack anywhere. Our last signals intercept... indicate that the Japanese taskforce is heading south... towards the Philippines or southeast Asia. But Captain Thurman of Naval intelligence here... has his own theory about the missing ships. Sir, I believe they'll try to hit us... where it'll hurt us the most- Pearl Harbor. It's over 4,000 nautical miles from Japan to Pearl. That's a long distance to steam a navy, Captain. Your theory is based on what? Well, it's what I would do. That's not exactly hard evidence, Captain Thurman. Well, Admiral, if I had hard evidence... we'd already be at war. Sir, we can read their diplomatic codes... faster than they can type them. But Captain Thurman's cryptology team... is still trying to crack the naval codes. The intercepts have missing words and garbled lines... so to explain the decrypts, we have to try to interpret... what we think they're trying to do. Interpret? You mean guess. They use their informed intuition, sir. We guess. It's like playing chess in the dark. Any rumor, troop movement, ship movement... spine-tingle, goose bump, we pay attention to it. When I was in the Asiatic Fleet... the locals used to try to get outside of a problem... to try to see the inside. Well, I see a strike on Pearl. It's the worst thing that could happen. A blow to Pearl would devastate... the Pacific Fleet's ability to make war. So, sir, you would have us mobilize the entire fleet... at the cost of millions of dollars... based on this spine-tingling feeling of yours? No, sir. My job is to gather and interpret material. Making difficult decisions... based on incomplete information... from my limited decoding ability... is your job, sir. Then break the damn naval code, Captain... so I can make a better decision. Aye, sir. We are trying. I wonder if we shouldn't put the Pacific Fleet on full alert. In case the optimism... of the ""Honolulu Advertiser"" proves unfounded, gentlemen... what are General Short and the Army... going to do about protecting my ships? Within a ten-mile radius of your harbor... we have fighterplanes here at Wheeler... bombers at Hickam, and a trainingstrip at Haleiwa. We've recently established a radar station here... that can detect planes 125 miles out. Which is a month old, Admiral, and untested. I've seen these new radar screens, Major. There's no way of telling whether they're ours, theirs... or a flock of damn birds. I'm intercepting a call from Tokyo... to somewhere close by Pearl. There's a call from Tokyo. They say they don't know you. Hello? Hai. It's a local dentist. He can see Pearl Harbor from his office. Are there many sailors around? Uh, the dentist says that the flatships... are not in port. They're talking about the weather. He doesn't seem to know who he's talking to. Hello? Hello? Moshi moshi. Hello? That was a strange call. Admiral, may I speak to you in private? Why would a spy use a phone? They know we tap all international lines. Our listeners feel it's probably not code talk. It sounds like someone in Japan is sneaking around... asking a local citizen the location of our carriers. Well, that makes me feel all warm inside. Get the FBI on it immediately. Have we found the goddamn Japanese Fleet yet? No, Admiral. The bases are looking all over the Pacific. So the entire fleet could be rounding Diamond Head... and we wouldn't know a thing about it. Get on it. I'm alive. This is the first I could get word out. Jepense qu'il est mort! ll estencore en vie. I told you I'd come back. Here, sit down. Sit down. Come here. It's OK. It's all right. You're real. Yeah. I wished for this every day. I know. Me, too. Every second. So did I. I thought you were dead. They said you were shot down in the sea. Yeah, I was. I was in the ocean. It was so cold. I missed you. I got picked up by a French fishing boat... and I was in occupied France, and I couldn't get word out. And I'm just-I'll tell you all about it, I promise. But I'm fine. I'm OK. And I'm here now. Evelyn... I just wanted to see you. You're so beautiful. I love you. Hey, it's OK. It's OK. Evelyn, Evelyn. I'm back. It's OK. I won't leave you again, I promise. Rafe, you died. And so did I. I know, but I'm-I'm- It's fine now. I'm back. We're together. I mean, we are together... right? I don't know where I am. Rafe. Rafe. Stay away. Rafe. This is Radio Honolulu... playing the sweetest music... on the sweetest island in the Pacific. It's a beautiful December 6th... with beautiful music... Raaaaafe! Oh, Goddamnit. There you go. A real live ace! Whoo! An ace is only five. I shot down six M.E.s. And I got two smokers, too. They don't count them. Of course, I got shot down myself before they could pin me. So you got back from behind enemy lines, huh? What's that combat like? Were you scared? Hey! One at a time. Well, them Luftwaffe boys can fly pretty good. It's not like, you know, training. They're, uh... Danny. You know, they're all about tactics is what it is. See, the Nazis, right, they're faster than you are... so they'll disappear and they get up in the soup... and they'll throw like a roll or a hammerhead... and they'll come around on your high side... shoot you from behind- like some Americans will. Hey... Gooz, you're lookin' at a real live ace. Well, let me give you the shirt off my back! Whoo! Aloha! There you go! I'll take it from you. I can see how y'all been spending your time out here. Hey, Rafe, we gotta talk, all right? I got nothin' to talk about with you. Here. Why don't you have a drink? I'll make a toast. To returning from the dead. Wasn't all I expected, but, well, that's life. To my best friend and loyal buddy Danny... for keepin' up the war effort back here at home. Ahh. You know, where I come from... somebody makes a toast to you and you don't drink... that's sayin' something. All right, Rafe. That's how it's gonna be. To you. Hey, you guys need to spend some time alone, I think. Aw, hell, no, Red. Come on. No, no, no. We're celebratin' here. Me over there fightin'... almost gettin' killed... my friend Danny back here... lookin' after my interests for me. Y'all know Danny was even good enough... to look out for my girl for me while I was gone? We thought you were dead, Rafe. And it gutted us both. And we were just tryin' to get on with our lives. Life is good, ain't it, Danny? You know, you're a rotten drunk. You always have been. Well, you're a lousy friend. That's a new development. You left her to fight somebody else's war... and you made damn sure that I didn't go with you... and we thought that you were dead- I almost did die, you little son of a bitch! And her face was the last thing that went through my mind... so don't stand there and tell me to act like it's all right! Yeah, Rafe, well, I stayed. I stayed, and you made sure of that... and some things changed. And I hope you can get used to that. Oh, I have to get used to it? All right. We'll see how I can get used to it. - Whoa! - Hey! Get used to that, boy! Hey, hey! And that's my left hand, too! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on! Melee at the Hula-la. Send M.P.s! - Aah! - Aah! - You called me a lousy friend? - Get your hands off! Aah! Ow! Shit! Come on, Danny! Let's go get 'em. Let's move out! Oh, no. They're gonna throw us in the brig. Let's get outta here. Oh, shit. Rafe... you're the only family I got. When you were gone... it was the loneliest I'd ever been. The same for her, too. Oh, boy, now you're really breakin' my heart. If you hadn't gone, none of this woulda happened. Oh, so it's my fault, I guess. Damn it, Rafe. I just know there's got to be some way... we can work things out so that... things could be right between me and you. I just don't see how it could ever be the same. Revered father... I go now to fulfill my mission and my destiny. I hope it is a destiny... that will bring honor to our family... and if it requires my life... I will sacrifice it gladly... to be a good servant of our nation. Hey... we got a large haze. That's too big to be planes, right? Is that what you wanna do? Knight to knight five? Boom! Wrong move. Lieutenant, radar's picking up... a large return moving in from the northeast. Hang on. Relax. It's a flight of B-17s coming in from the mainland. Nothing to worry about. A heck of a lot of B-17s. Good shot, Hop. This better be good, Commander. One of our destroyers reports having fired and sunk... enemy submarine attempting to enter Pearl Harbor at 0653. It's 7:20! We had decoder delays, Admiral. Relay this to Washington. Recall the staff. ""Failure... ""'Peace talks... ""useless. "" Thurman here. Tokyo transmitting... to their embassy in Washington- ""Discontinue use of your decoding machine... ""and dispose of immediately. ""Special emphasis on destroying important parts. "" Do you read that? Acknowledge. Admiral... Naval Intel intercepted a transmission from Tokyo... to the Japanese embassy in Washington... instructing them to break apart all decoder machines... and burn all secret documents. The Japanese are expecting a war. Should we? Warning of possible... Japanese aggressive movement in any direction. ""Broken relationship. Hostilities imminent. "" But where? Did you ever lose a fight, Miller? I been lucky so far, Captain. From what I hear, it ain't luck. Ship's proud of you, son. Ha ha ha. Yeah! Ha ha! Why the hell's the Navy... doing practice this early on a Sunday? - Aah! - Get down! Go, go, go, go! I'm with Navy newsreel, and I can tell you one thing- them ain't Navy planes! All hands, man your battle stations! We're being bombed! We're being bombed! Get up! Get up! Jesus Christ! Man your battle stations. Another dumb drill.

Holy cow! I hope there's still an airfield left. Hurry up! What in the world? Look! So many! Everybody to the hospital! Why's the Navy always buzzin' us? shut up, Red! - Oh, man, come on. - Red, it's too early. The Japs are here! What the hell? Let's go! Let's go! - Get corpsmen to the bridge. - Aye, Captain!

Send up ammunition for the five-inch guns! Medic! All of 'em, now! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Come on! Aah! Come on! Come on, you sum 'bitch! Aah! Aah ha! Oh, yeah! I need a doctor! Somebody help me! Get to the supply room! Get everything out! - Aah! - Planes incoming! Cut 'em down! Come on, come on! Get 'em away from the windows! The mattresses! Get 'em against the wall! Take cover! Is everybody all right? Can you stand? Can you stand? Hold your fire! Get to the gun! Hurry up! Get down, Danny! Aah! - Earl! - This is Walker! We need to get those planes fueled and loaded right now! What's going on out there? Huh? Danny, what the hell's that noise? You guys doin' target practice or something? I think World War II just started. Go, go, go! - Billy! - Run! - It's gonna blow! - It's a dud. It's a dud! Come on, get down! Danny! Danny, are you all right? I'm all right! Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Gooz, come on, man! We're sinking! We're sinking! Stay together! Close the hatches! - I can't swim! - Just hang on! Let's move it now! Joe! Go! Go! We're gettin' outta here! Get in the car! Get in! Get in! Come on, let's go! Go! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Come on! Where's this place we're goin'? We got a small mechanic runway about ten minutes away. Hasn't been hit yet. We got Zeros on our six! Duck! Help us! Aah! We're trapped. Try it! Try the door! Aah! Oh, my God! I'm going under! It's sucking me back! The current's too strong! They're shootin' at us! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! This is it. Get us out of here now! How bad? It's still not over, sir. An entire fleet at anchor. My God, my God... Barbara, fill every syringe you can find with morphine! Fill up the kitchen! Are you listening to me? Fill up the kitchen! Over there! Over there! We got a bad neckwound here! Surgery! Move! Get him to surgery! Oh, God. In here! He's still bleeding! Another hemostat! Hurry! Give me a hemostat now! Damn it, hurry! Gimme another hemostat! Another suture! Hurry! Give me a- Oh, God, I'm so sorry! Doctor! Here! Aah! Am I gonna die? Nurse! Don't leave me! Doctor! Get over here! My fingers are plugging his artery! Doctor, what do you need? Focus, look at me. What do you need? - Hemostat. - Hemostat. Here. All right, look at me. You're going to be all right. You're going to be all right. I need more ammo! I need more ammo, ladies! I need more ammo! Earl! We good to go? - Mostly, but- - Get down! - Shit! Get cover! - Jesus! - Come on, you guys! - Earl, get in here! Sergeant! We need more than a shotgun! You got any other weapons for coverfire? Inside that ammo locker! - Come on! - Move it! - Go! Go! - Get the guns out! You said the planes are mostly ready, but... but what? She's down, she's broke, she's shit. I got four left. One's good, two need ammo, one needs fuel. Fall out and load up in the bunker! Let's go! Get down! - Move! - Get ready to roll this thing! Get down! Now! Anthony, Red, you stay here and man the fifty-caliber. Gooz, get to the next bunker and lay down some coverfire. Planes. Should we fire? Stay down! God damn it! Hold your fire! Stay still! Nobody fire! Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. They don't know we're here. - Stay down. - Fire? No, God damn it, stay down, stay still. Don't fire. Oh, God. I don't see any ordnance. I think they're going home. No. They'll be back. We still got planes on the ground. Pilots, listen up. Get all the speed you can on the runway... don't get on the stick till the very end. In the air, stay low between the buildings. You see any Zero on your tail... wipe him off, don't freeze. Just keep moving. Try to separate 'em, take 'em out one by one. P-40s can't outrun Zeros, so don't try. We have to outfly 'em. We got high-level bombers! They'll bust this hangar wide open! Grab the fifties! Let's move! Move! Move! Go, go, go! Zeros! Take cover! Take cover! Take cover! Take cover! Aah! - Get down! Get down! - Let's go! In the box! Aah! Danny! Come on! Come on, buddy! Leave him, he's dead! He's dead! They're kicking our butt. Get to the airplanes! Go, go, go! Run! Red, Anthony, let's go! Come on, help me! Goddamn belts! Let's go! Come on! Knock 'em dead. Quick! Get in! Put this on! They're coming around. Bring 'em out! Let's go! Red, get out of here, God damn it! Go! Come on, let's go. Joe, get out the way! I'm rollin'! Clear! Go! Oh, God. Planes! Come on, help me! Hey, Joe! You got three Zeros behind you! Turn! Turn! Oh, God! Aah! Oh, shit. What are you doing? Get going! Danny, start that thing up and get in the air. I'm not much good without a wing man. I need you! I got you! Let's do it! It's real tight, Rafe! Real tight! Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure we have enough runway! Get your airspeed up before you leave the dirt! Don't freeze. Don't freeze. I don't think I'm gonna make it over! Come on! Come on! We did it! I'm up! We got Zeros behind us! How many you see back there? We got five on our six! Take it down to the deck, now! We gotta split 'em up. You take left, I'll take right. Earl, get some guns in that goddamn tower! OK! Let's go! Into the truck! Danny, I got three on my six. Whoo! Stop! Stop! Let's go! Let's go! Move it! Move it, Red! - Let's go! - Gimme the fifty! Let's go! All right! I still got two behind me, Rafe. Yaah! Son of a bitch! Whoa! Earl, God damn it, get some guns in that tower! On the tower. Going ten stories up. It's a long son of a bitch. Rafe, they're all over me! I can't get them off me! Danny, I still got three on my tail! Keep jinking it! Don't let them get a handle! I can't shake 'em! God damn it. Danny, let's play chicken with these Jap suckers! I'm with you. Jesus! - I'm coming right at you! - Don't brake till I tell you. Not yet! Not yet! Come on! Go left! Now! - Whoo! We got 'em! - Ha ha ha! Set up over there! Come on, load it! We're on the tower. I got one on my tail. I'll bring him right by you. He's comin' around! Let's get this Jap sucker! Hold your fire. Here he comes. You better be cocked and locked when I come by! Hold your fire! Fire! Whoo! Good shootin', boys! Nice shot, Earl! Let's head over to battleship row! I'm with you! Let's go do some business. I'm going after 'em. Rafe! I got him! - P-40's! - Yeah! They're pulling into the clouds! We ain't gonna let these sons of bitches get home! How do you like someone shooting back at you? Oh, I'm on your ass now! Yeah! I got one! Come on! God, come on! Come on, stay in there! Whoa! I got you, you son of a bitch! Who taught you how to fly, Lieutenant? He did. I have to amputate here! I have to amputate! You're not gonna die! I got you. Hold onto this... Sandra, we're running out of morphine. Find some way to mark 'em... So we can keep track of who's got morphine already. Tell me about your ship. What ship are you from? It's not marking. Have you got a marker? Use my lipstick! Put ""M"" for morphine. - We need a tourniquet! - Tourniquet! Where are the clamps? There's nothing left! - Evelyn! - Here, use this. Go outside. There's too many to help. Sort them out. Only those that can be saved you bring in. I can't... No, please, I need you to do it! Go! Go! Aah! Don't look at anyone without a mark! I told you, stand back! Keep 'em outside! Come on! Let's go! Wait here. Don't touch me, you Jap! Get your hands off me! Get him into critical. - Get him off me. - Critical, frontward! How bad am I? You're gonna be just fine, sweetheart. - I don't wanna die. - You're not gonna die. I've got your hand. Do you have enough morphine to make him comfortable? He won't make it. Line the critical up! Get him morphine. Take him over there! Burn victims by the tree! I just found her! I don't think she's breathing. No, she's dead. Take her- Oh, God. Are you sure, Ev? Check her again. She's dead. Take her over there! But you've gotta be sure! She's dead! Go back to work, Sandra. I don't know what to do! Over here! Admiral? From Washington. ""Attack by Japan considered imminent. "" They're only an hour late. How can we help? We need blood. Come on. Remember, son, hold on to your faith. 1,500 cartons over there. ""'Today you will be with me in paradise... ""so fear not. "" Fear not, my son. You are a man truly blessed. You will die in a state of grace. Remember, pain is temporary, but glory is forever. Hold on to your faith, my son. You'll be with God, the saints, and the angels soon. I absolve you of your sins... in the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit. Innomine patris et fili, et spiritus sancti. Amen. Go with God, my son. We've got men trapped everywhere in the harbor. We need help from anybody who can move. There's somebody in here! Get somebody down here! They're cutting through! I hear somebody! Get some guys up here! Pull! Get us out! It's filling with water! Get an airline in here! We need the air hose! What can we do? It won't cut any faster! - Cut him out! - Aah! Yesterday... December 7, 1941... a date which will live in infamy... the United States of America... was suddenly and deliberately attacked... by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan. It is obvious... that planning the attack began many weeks ago. During the intervening time... the Japanese government... has deliberately sought to deceive the United States... by false statements... and expressions of hope for continued peace. The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands... has caused severe damage to American military forces. I regret to tell you... that over 3,000 American lives have been lost. No matter how long it may take us... to overcome this premeditated invasion... the American people, in their righteous might... will win through to absolute victory. Because of this unprovoked, dastardly attack by Japan... I ask that the Congress declare a state of war. Is it true... men are still trapped alive inside the Arizona? We can hear tapping from inside the hull. We're doing everything we can to get to them... but they're forty feet below water. We've been trained to think that we're invincible. And now our proudest ships have been destroyed... by an enemy we considered inferior. We're on the ropes, gentlemen. That's exactly why we have to strike back now. We'll attack the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, sir. I mean hitting the heart of Japan the way they have hit us. Mr. President... Pearl Harbor caught us unawares because we didn't face facts. This isn't a time for ignoring them again. We have long-range bombers, but no place to launch them. Midway is too far, and Russia won't allow us... to launch a raid from there. Admiral? Navy's planes are small. They carry light loads and have a short range. We'd have to get them within a few hundred miles of Japan. We'd risk our carriers, and if we lose them... we'll have no shield against invasion. Does anyone in this room think victory is possible... without facing danger? We are at war. Of course there's a risk. But consider the risk, Mr. President. If the Japanese invade us right now... they would reach Chicago before we could stop them. Gentlemen... most of you did not know me when I had the use of my legs. I was strong and proud... and arrogant. Now I wonder, every hour of my life... why God put me into this chair. But when I see defeat in the eyes of my country men- in your eyes, right now- I start to think that maybe he brought me down... for times like these... when we all need to be reminded who we truly are- that we will not give up or give in. Mr. President, with all respect, sir... what you're asking can't be done. - Mr. President! - Get back, George! Get back. Do not tell me... it can't be done. Japan continues its military conquest... throughout the Pacific. But, back home... millions of American workers band together... bringing factories to life to avenge Pearl Harbor. Mr. President, we have an idea how to bomb the Japanese. Sir, it's risky... but it's bold. - Who are you? - I, sir? Captain Low, Mr. President. He's a submariner. He came up with this idea. I like sub commanders. They don't have time for bullshit, and neither do I. Fire away, gentlemen. And where is God in all this? Our enemies believe a divine wind protects them. But we see our friends laid out here before us. Hey, Captain. Lieutenants Rafe McCawley, Daniel Walker. Yes, Major? You're both going stateside. Fly out in two hours. What for, sir? Ask Colonel Doolittle. Yes, sir. You're packing. Orders. What kind of orders? The top-secret kind. The dangerous kind. I can't find Danny. Is that why you're here? Looking for Danny? Probably saying good-bye to his squadron. We've been assigned to Doolittle. I wasn't looking for Danny. I couldn't have you go away... without you understanding something. Yeah. You don't have to explain anything. I do, because you're acting like I didn't love you. Evelyn, loving you kept me alive. I should've died over there. When I was in that water, I made a deal with God. I told him I was sorry... that I knew I'd been a fool for leaving you... trying to go over there and be a hero... and I promised I'd never ask for anything again... if I could just see you one more time. And you know what? It was worth it. You kept me alive, Evelyn. You brought me home. So I'm gonna stand by my end of the deal. I'm gonna walk away. And I won't ask you for anything. But I just want to know why. Just tell me that, will you, please? Just tell me why. Rafe, I'm pregnant. Oh, my God. I didn't even know until the day you turned up alive. And then all this happened. I haven't told Danny. I don't want him to know. All he needs to think about... is how to do this mission and get back alive. Rafe, all I ever wanted... was for us to have a home, grow old together... but life never asked me what I wanted. Now, I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart... but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset... without thinking of you. I'll love you my whole life. I'll see you on board. You know, the only thing that scares me... is that you might love him more than you love me. I love you, Danny. And I'll be here waiting for you when you come back. Follow me. Colonel. Congratulations on your promotion, sir. I heard what you did. We can explain that, sir. Explain what? Whatever it is you heard about us, sir. You mean the hula shirts you were flying in? Or the seven planes you shot down? You're both being awarded the Silver Star... and promoted to captain. Is that the good news, sir, or... You're just about the only pilots in the Army... with combat experience. I need you for a mission... I've been ordered to put together. You know what top secret is? Yes, sir. It's the kind of mission where you get medals. But they send 'em to your relatives. Top secret means you train for something... never done before in aviation history... and you go without knowing where you're going. You do it on that basis or not at all. I'll go, sir. I'll go, too, sir. By the way, the Brits sent over your personal effects. Thank you, sir. There's only one more thing. Leave your goddamn hula shirts at home. Dear Rafe... It's so strange to be this far from you... but you should know this- every night... I've been looking all over for you. Danny, this... this ain't no time to leave things unsaid. Now, we gotta face facts here. The fact is, we just both love the same woman. She's the first girl I ever felt this way about, Rafe. I couldn't help what happened any more than you could. This is different, though, Danny. Evelyn already lost the man she loved once. I just don't want it to see that happen to her again. Guys like us got no choice. This is war. She knows that. Danny, don't do this. Don't go on this mission. You got nothing to prove. You've been protecting me since we were kids. Yeah, well... you do tend to need it from time to time. The mission I'm asking you to volunteer for... is exceptionally dangerous. Take a look at the man beside you. It's a good bet that in the next six weeks... you or he... will be dead. Everyone brave enough to accept this... step forward. Your grandmother could take a B-25 off... on a mile-long runway. Well, I'm gonna train you to do it in 467 feet. Because at 468 feet... you're dead. And once you get it up... you'll learn to fly it like a fighter... thirty feet off the ground. I want you to say hello... to Lieutenant Jack Richards, Navy Aviation. He'll help us lighten these fat ladies. Dump that ash can. See that bomb sight? Get rid of it. Colonel, he's crazy! - The lady's fat! - Listen to him. She's fat. We want a skinny lady! Max power! Get up, get up! - Damn! - How the heck- Damn! They just keep rolling past that line. Maybe it's a bad idea. No, they're too heavy. We gotta get drastic. This armored plating goes. I'm sure, I'm sure. Lose it like a skirt, son. Release brakes! Come on, come on! - God! - Put every man on the line! Let's show these boys how this thing is done! Come on! Max power. Well, if he can do it... Well, gentlemen, now I can tell you... that we're going to Tokyo. And we're gonna bomb it. That comes as a special request... directly from President Roosevelt. The Navy'll sneak us about 400 miles off the coast... and we'll launch from the carrier there. Has that been done before? Taking Army bombers off Navy carriers? - No. - OK. Any other questions? Well, sir, is it even possible to land... a B-25 on an aircraft carrier deck? That won't matter. As soon as we're airborne, the carrier heads for Hawaii. But without them, where do we land? I have a phrase I want you to memorize. Wo shimeiguo ren. It means ""I am an American"". In Chinese. Ain't gonna be any easier. That's three feet shorter than our practice runway. - Fellas? - Sir. Sir. Secretary of the Navy gave me these. What are they? Friendship medals the Japanese gave us... when they were pretending to want peace. What'll you do with them? Wire them to the bombs and give them back. So what's going on? Well, sir, we only have sixteen planes. So? When the Japs hit us, they had more than 300. How much difference can we make? It's not that we're afraid, sir. But we might die, and we want to know what it's for. You know, at Pearl, they hit us with a sledgehammer. This raid, even if we make it through... it'll only be a pin prick... but it'll be straight through their hearts. Victory belongs to those that believe in it the most... and believe in it the longest. We're gonna believe. We're gonna make America believe, too. Colonel? I need a minute. - Excuse me, Major Jackson? - Yes? Do you remember me? Oh, sure I do. I'm sorry. I've been meaning to thank you. Well, maybe you can. When the news comes in about the Doolittle boys... I want to be in the command post. I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. How the hell do you know about this mission? Let's call it an inadvertent disclosure. Some flyboy you're dating shot his mouth off. Actually, it's about two pilots. I know they're going into great danger. I just want to be there when the news tells us... if they've lived or died. Most officers would have thrown you in the brig. Most nurses wouldn't keep their fingers... plugged in your artery. I can't promise you anything. Hey, Red, you think they picked us... to do this 'cause we're young and dumb? Come on, Gooz, we're the tip of the sword. In honor of our trip to Japan... I got us some victory cigars! - Yeah! - There you go. Put that in your insidepocket, next to your heart. You know, Jack, we may lose this battle... but we're gonna win this war. - You know how I know? - No. Them. 'Cause they're rare. And at times like these, you see them... stepping forward. There's nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer, Jack. My friends in the war department... don't want me to lead this raid... because they say I'm too valuable. They don't want me up in the air... flying with the men that I've chosen... that I've chewed out, cussed out, pushed to the limit... and that I've come to respect. They want me to stand on the flight deck... and wave you off. Well, I don't see it that way. So I'm going with you. We take off tomorrow afternoon... drop our fire, and head for China. Our mission is to hit military targets... aircraft and tank factories. Colonel, you've given us homing beacons... but you said China is overrun with Japanese troops. What if the beacons are switched off? Bring her down any way you can... and do your best to avoid capture. What if we have to bail out over Japan? Well, in that situation, I can't tell you what to do. What would you do, Colonel? I wasn't built to be a prisoner... so I would have my crew bail out. I'd find the sweetest military target I could... and drive my plane right smack into the middle of it... But that's just me. I'm forty-five years old. I'm an old man. You guys have your whole lives ahead of you... so what you do is up to you. The mission will launch in a couple of hours. You'll stay right in here. Here. Stay here. Don't talk to them. They won't talk to you. Pretend to type the information we pass you. That's it. This is Orphan Annie from Radio Tokyo. To all the lonely boys in the South Pacific... watch out- the enemy will get you. Maybe she's right. Japs transmitting! Captain, radar reports Japanese patrol boats. - Range 400 yards. - How many yards? 400 yards and closing, sir. Richards, Japs! 400 yards! Let's go! Admiral Halsey's ordering the cruisers to open fire! We gotta sink these Jap boats before they give us away. Go to general quarters! Go, go, go, go! Oh, my God. This can't be good! All hands, man your battle stations. Japs one mile away. They reported our position. Supposed to launch 400 miles away. How far are we? 624 miles. - Jesus! - What do you want to do? Colonel, I don't know if the planes... can carry enough fuel to make it to China. Now. We launch now! Army pilots! Man your planes! Man your planes! They're shooting at something. - Let's go! - It ain't a drill! Colonel! We're too far out to make it! They need more fuel, but they can't get too heavy! Strip everything out of this plane you don't need now! Start pre-flight! Let's go! Add ten cans of fuel for each plane! Every plane! Let's go! Move! Guys, get up there! Lose those suitcases now! - What's your favorite gun? - What? You want off this deck, give me a gun now! It's still too heavy! Go to the kitchen, get some broomsticks. Cut 'em down, paint 'em black, and bring them here. We'll put a broomstick where this gun was. What are you doing to my plane? Tell your crew to take a piss before they take off. We got broomsticks for tail guns. Yeah. Maybe it'll scare 'em. You take care of yourself up there. Yeah, I will. Danny, be careful, you hear me? I will. I'll see you, Rafe. Rafe! We're the tip of the sword! - Turning on one! - Turning on two! All right. You ready for this? - Superchargers low and latched! - Low and latched. We're full into the wind! More speed! More speed! Are you nervous? No-yes, sir. Yes. When did you find religion? When you assigned me to this mission, sir. Do me a favor. - What's that, Colonel? - Pray for both of us. Tell me when! Let's go! Max power! Oh, please. Come on! Come on! Yeah! Way to go! Jesus, that was short. Move 'em up! Full power, here we go! Pull back! Ha ha ha! Come on, here we go, here we go! We made it! From Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo... we have been described... as a nation of weaklings and playboys... who hire British, Russian, or Chinese soldiers... to do our fighting for us. Let them repeat that now. Let them tell that to General MacArthur and his men. Let them tell that to the soldiers who today... are fighting hard in the far waters of the Pacific. Let them tell that to the boys in the flying fortresses. Let them tell that to the Marines. That's Japan, fellas. Tighten up back there! Man your guns! We're in the enemy's backyard! Look alive back there. I see coastline. Heads up, boys! Heads up! Man your guns back there. I'm cocked and locked! Get ready, suckers! Approaching targets for bombing raid! Open bomb bay doors. Ripley, you gota target in sight? 37 degrees! Target in sight! All right, boys, let's knock their clocks off! - Drop your ordnance! - Bombs away! One away! - Bombs away! - Bombs away! Two away! Three away! Four away! We caught 'em by surprise! - Dropping ordnance! - Bombs away! ...factory. - Whoo! - We got it! We hit our targets! Good job, raiders! God! Jesus-what? Shit! We got flak everywhere! Go down there and get Gooz! I want everyone to separate! - Clean that up! - Yes, sir. Try and clean that up! They're shooting flak at us! We gotta get out of this shit, Gooz! - We got a fire! - Tail's hit! The electrics! We got a fire back here! I gotta short this out! Get into the clouds, Danny, right now! God damn! Red, go check that out! We're getting covered! Just hope they don't hit a prop! Unh! I'm hit! They're tearing this plane apart! Red, take it up, 800 feet. Aah! I think Theo's dead! Theo, wake up! Theo! Get into the clouds, Danny, right now! Get up in that soup! We're gonna pull out of this, Gooz! Thank you, George. What is it, General? Colonel Doolittle had to advance his execution order... by twelve hours, Mr. President. There will be no homing beacons. The plane carrying them crashed en route to China... and our bombers may lack the fuel... to reach the mainland, sir. So our boys are flying blind on empty tanks. God help them. We're still not getting a signal. All ocean and no land. Homing in on nothing. How many cans of fuel we got left? These are all empty! Is this all you got? That's all we got, Red. Rafe! You better pray for land! Break radio silence. I'm sorry, gentlemen. You're all brave souls. The bravest I've ever had the privilege of flying with. But we're on our own. This really was a suicide mission. Engine one's fluctuating. We'll lose it any minute. - Rafe, you gotta prime it. - I am. How about now? I see the coast. I see the coast! Copy that, Rafe. We're gonna make it. Danny, follow me. We can make this. I can see the coast now. We're only a few miles out. We gotta find a soft landing spot. I'm pushing up on two. Hold on for a hard landing! I see rice paddies. We'll bring it in right here. Oh, God, engine one's dead. We'll lose engine two any second. We can make it in. Easy. Pull it back, glide in on fumes. Japs! We got Jap patrols all over the place! Japs! Land somewhere else! Strap yourselves in! We're coming in hard! We're a deadstick. Get outta the nose! Hold on, boys! We're going down! Watch the trees! Everyone all right? I'm OK! I'm OK! Where's Ripley? He's dead. Watch for Japs! - Jap patrols! - Take cover! Who's got magazines? Got em! Gotta get up into those hills, find the Chinese! They got us pinned down! - Danny! - Rafe! Rafe, no! Danny! Rafe, you don't have a chance! God damn. Danny! Come on! Gooz? You OK, man? Danny? Aw, shit, Anthony. Gooz! Can you hear me? - Yeah. - Come on. Danny. Easy, easy, easy. I've had better landings. You saved us back there. I got something in my neck. - Let me pull this out. - Where's Gooz? He's fine. He's right over there. Rafe! Grenade! Danny. Danny! Danny! Oh! - Hold on! - Rafe! Hold on, now. I got you. You're all right. You're all right. I'm not gonna make it. Oh, yes, you are. Yes, you are. Now look at me. Rafe, I'm so cold. I'm so cold. You're all right. Hey. Hey, Rafe? Can you do me a favor? What? Can you have someone else write my name on the tombstone? You're not gonna die. Look at me, listen to me! You ain't gonna die, you hear me? Danny. Danny, you can't die. You can't die. You know why? 'Cause you're gonna be a father. You're gonna be a daddy. I wasn't supposed to tell you. You're gonna be a father. Please. No. You are. Danny. Danny? Please, please! Please. God. Please, Danny. Hold your fire! They're Chinese. When the action is over and we look back... we understand both more and less. This much is certain. Before the Doolittle raid... America knew nothing but defeat. After it, there was hope of victory. Japan realized for the first time that they could lose... and began to pull back. America realized that she would win... and surged forward. It was a war that changed America... ...and the world. Dorie Miller was the first black American... to be awarded the Navy Cross. But he would not be the last. He joined a brotherhood of heroes. That's for all the raiders. World War II for us began at Pearl Harbor... and 1,177 men still lie entombed... in the battleship Arizona. America suffered... but America grew stronger. It was not inevitable. The times tried our souls... and through the trial, we overcame. Hey, Danny... how'd you like to go flying? Come here. When I think back on these times And the dreams we left behind I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed To get to have you in my life When I look back on these days I'll look and see your face You were right there for me In my dreams I'll always see you Soar above the sky In my heart, there'll always be a place for you For all my life I'll keep a part of you with me And everywhere I am There you'll be And everywhere I am There you'll be Well, you showed me how it feels Feel the sky with in my reach And I always will remember All the strength you gave to me Your love made me make it through Oh, I owe so much to you You were right there for me In my dreams I'll always see you Soar above the sky In my heart, there'll always be A place for you For all my life I'll keep a part of you with me And everywhere I am There you'll be 'Cause I always saw in you my light My strength And I want to thank you now For all the ways You were right there for me You were right there for me For always In my dreams I'll always see you Soar above the sky In my heart, there'll always be A place for you For all my life I'll keep a part of you with me And everywhere I am There you'll be And everywhere I am There you'll be There you'll be, Bobby. Bobby. No! All right, we lined up? Get that line. Put the stern line on quick. Bobby! Hey, baby! Missed you. Hey, big man, how you doing? - Hey, Murph! - Hey, Ethel. How you doing? Welcome home. - You seen Deb and my boy? - No, I'm sorry. Ma! - How you doing, beautiful? - Hello, Bobby. Home safe. Who's that? - Ol' Ben. - No. Poor old guy. Hey, Linda. - Hey, boss. - What's the score? My kind of numbers. I lost Ben Pulley. He passed away onboard. Sorry to hear that. How'd you hit it, Billy? Didn't hit very hard, did you? We all have slumps, but you're overdue to break out of yours. Did you hear the lady? Ben Pulley's dead. That old man pickled himself to death drinking 7& 7s chasing Narragansetts. Linda, with Ben, it was never a question of ""if,"" but ""when."" - I'll bury him. - I'll pay for it. See, you got what you wanted. Bring in your fish. It shouldn't take too long. Murph. Sign my ledger. Shatford. Sign my ledger. What's the matter? It's $2221. Aren't we a little short? We were sharing up last night. I thought it'd be three plus. You stocked 21,000 pounds at 3.50 a pound. That comes to $ 73,000. Minus $35,000 for bait, tackle, fuel. That comes out to $38,500. I get half. I own the boat. Your captain takes double share, four crewmen get a share each. And a rookie like you, three-quarters share. That comes to $2221. What it is, is what it is. Sign the ledger. Moran. You going out again this season, skipper? Why? You got a site in Florida? Bradenton Beach. The Cecile. Pack your shit and get out. You like Florida? Well, it beats the Grand Banks in October. It gets rough up here, Dougie likes the sun down there. Or he thinks he'll score better with another captain. I didn't say that. Yes, you did. Goodbye. Here's your cut. $5923.76. Sign the ledger. That's a record low for you, isn't it? Next time, track Linda. She'll take you where the fish are. You're getting to be rude, you know? I like you, Billy. I always have. But I like my boat better. If you can't make it pay, I'll find somebody who can. You trying to put a charge up my ass? You're on a cold streak. I'm encouraging you to catch fish. I'll bring you more fish than you ever dreamed of. Next time I fish the Grand Banks, they won't be so grand. You just struck out on the Grand Banks. Then I'll go further. Don't even think about it. I want my boat back. And I want to catch some fish. It's what I do. Not lately. Want to yank my site, you go ahead. - Murph. - Hey, skip. What are you doing out here? Get in there. Get drunk. Waiting on my ex... ...and my son. Give him lots of hugs and kisses tonight. You don't gotta remind me to do that, skip. Ladies, you're looking fine. How you doing? Can I buy you a drink? What, what, what? Hey, rookie. What are you so happy about? It wasn't exactly a slammer up on the Grand Banks. Isn't it past your bedtime? Bugs, how you making out? I'm not. I don't know. Maybe I smell like fish. - You need a new deodorant. - Maybe I need a new face. Frickin' Alfred Pierre. They were upstairs, they come down, a little refreshment. Now they're going back up again. Half an hour ago, they shook the lamps over the bar. Last time she brought her sister. You should've seen the lamps then. How do he do it, mon? I think he's fishin' with a longer pole, Bugs. What happened? They had a sale on kids' shoes at Ames. Sorry. No problem. Hi. Hello. So you want to have a drink? Come on, Debra. What do you say, for old times' sake? It was the old times that killed us. Is that what it was? There you go. I'm a little short. It wasn't exactly a slammer. Half for you. You sure? Yeah, I'm working. Want to come with your daddy? Shoot some pool? Have a drink? Just bring him home in an hour. Good shot, buddy. All right, Sully, you think about it. All right? Bugs. Murph, come here. Here comes your fearless leader, Captain Billy Tyne. I got a feeling skipper's coming to give us bad news. Lady's not only pretty, she's smart. Yeah, we're going back out. What'd I tell you? - When? - A few days. ""Few"" means two? Two days is right. Skip, we just got back in. You don't want your site, a replacement's a call away. Join me, don't join me. There's time for one last shot. The Andrea Gail will take it. This time I promise you, we'll come back with a shitload of fish. Excuse me, men, madam. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna tell him to stick his head up his ass. I'd like to hear that. Hear what? I'd like to hear you tell him to stick it up his ass. Go on, Bob. Yeah, that's just how I'll tell him as soon as we get back. You're a bastard. Why? Why do I even love you? - Come on. - No. Why? Why, Bobby? When you get the answer, tell me. I could use it myself. - Get laid, Bugsy. - Easy for you to say. Go on up there. Don't make the same mistake I did. You're going away again? Yeah. Take me with you. Come here. Go back, Bobby. Go back to what you did before. - Pack cod, repair tackle. - I'm sick of that. It's safe and it pays. Not enough. Just one more time. I promise. I have to try it again. We need the money, baby. Money. It's always about the money. Well, I got a divorce lawyer, a mountain of debt. And there's your two kids. You gotta get them back. Do you think you'll love them? They're yours, aren't they? Hey, beautiful. Yeah, you. Buy you a drink? Seeing as I got two in front of me, I don't think so. I'm not very observant, am I? I got a feeling, yeah, along with a lot of other things. Why don't we start over? You know what would look good on you? Me. No good? Have a drink. It's not that bad. Thank you. Here's to crime. You're pathetic. You still want to be a fisherman? Who told you I wanted to be a fisherman? You want to come with me. I want to come with you, but I don't want to be a fisherman. You know, buddy... ...one of these days your mom's gonna find you a new dad. I don't want a new dad. I'm sorry. Your mom can't sit around by herself all the time. She isn't sitting around. I'm sure he's a good guy. I know your mom wouldn't take up with anybody but a good guy. And you know, buddy... ...the most important thing is that you and Mommy are happy. Can we talk about something else now? I miss you too, buddy. I miss you so damn much. What'd you say your name was again? Irene. Is that so tough? I'm sorry. Listen. Could I maybe take you home? I don't think so. I came to watch the game. Instead I got schnockered with Bugsy. - What does Bugsy stand for anyway? - Michael. That's a nice name. Why don't you use it? Because people know me as Bugsy. I'm gonna shove off now. Big day tomorrow. I can't take you home? What, in a wheelbarrow? Crew guys like you never have cars. Lay off. I got feelings too. Where, down in your pants? Jesus, lady, where's the passion in your life? Home in bed. One of them's 6, the other one's 8. All I can say is, there's some lucky kids. They got a wonderful mother. You're not messing with me, are you? Haven't got time. We're going out in two days. Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Michael. Gotta go. What do you mean? - Where you going? - Have these. - Thank you. - See you. - Bye, Ethel. - See you. Watch your step. I smell Coppertone. That means that Captain Linda Greenlaw... ...a lady vain about her nose, is in my wheelhouse. Make that Hawaiian Tropic. At least I got the nose right. Your guys are loading bait and groceries. - You doing a turnaround? - No rest for the weary. There you go. Flaunting your work ethic. I don't have a work ethic. I just have work. If I'm gonna catch up to you. I love to watch you study charts. Why? You know them all by heart. What's special about today that you're blowing smoke up my ass? I thought I'd make a pass. You see, I'm looking for a guy to come home to Maine with me... ...buy a house and raise kids. What does that guy and you do after? The thing is, I'm happy. I'm happy I'm fit to do this. I just don't see the romance in it. But you've got it, Captain Greenlaw. You do. Believe me. I've seen them come and go. The day I laid eyes on you, I said, ""She's gonna be a good one."" You can't be good unless you love it. The fog's just lifting. You throw off your bow line, throw off your stern. You head out the South Channel... ...past Rocky Neck, Ten Pound Island... ...past Niles Pond, where I skated as a kid. Blow your horn... ...and wave to the lighthouse keeper's kid on Thatcher Island. Then the birds show up. Black-backs... ...herring gulls, big dump ducks. The sun hits you. Head north, open up to 12. You're steaming now. The guys are busy, you're in charge. You know what? You're a goddamn swordboat captain. Is there anything better in the world? Sully. So what do you think? You been busy? Busy enough. I was working menhaden in Annisquam. But they laid off Labor Day. Mended nets over in Fairhaven. That's crap. What's this you're doing now? Helping out a friend. He paying you? He's my friend. Murphy keep his site? You want this job or not? I do. Lord, did I do that? Yeah, you did. But I'm not completely blind. I can still see out of the other one. Next time I should break a leg. Then you can stay home and collect disability. Think of all those handicapped parking spaces. Tell me last night was worth it. I can't remember. Can't remember, my ass. No, I remember your ass. Last night was worth it. There's nothing like sleeping with you. Just sleeping... ...lying next to you... ...all warm and sweet. And me wishing the morning would never come. Catching up. Oh, boy, oh, boy. Look at that shiner. Come on, Murph, will you? Good morning. Where'd you get the mouse? Chris ""Boom-Boom"" Cotter. Put some hair around that hole, I bet you could hit it. Not with a pool cue, or any other pointed instrument. What do you know except to cut squid and take them to bed with you? Ethel, where you getting your customers these days? The welfare office? Who gave you that scar, tough guy? Back off! Back off. Come on, swing it. You assholes! How you gonna act onboard if you're already at each other's throats? All right, Ma. See you onboard. - Alfred Pierre, one for the road? - No, tanks, Mom. ""No, tanks, Mom."" Guy can't even speak good English. Well, anyway, can I get you anything? Let's go, boys. I'll wait for you in the car, Bobby. Catch fish, boys. Lots of them. Full ahead. Hold down the fort, Quentin. Thanks, Q. Thanks, Ethel. Gotta go, Mom. The Grand Banks. I know. Grand Banks are no joke in October. All right? Be careful. At least we'll get cancer together. I can't put it off any longer. I'm not too big on goodbyes. Don't go, Bobby. I got a bad feeling. I've been thinking about it. Then for God's sake, don't go. I'll moonlight, I'll sell the car. We'll work nights, weekends. Whatever it takes, little by little, we'll put something away. I gotta go. Michael. Irene. Irene. I knew that. I just wanted to say goodbye. No one ever said goodbye to me before. Well, goodbye, Irene. Goodbye. I wish it were night so I could say, ""Good night, Irene."" That'll come later. Well, you gotta go. Come on, boys. Let's go. I love you. I will always love you, Christina. Pack it in there good. We got more coming down. Did we get all them eggs up there? We catching some fish Is that gonna crap out again? Never! Do you mind? Stinks in here, doesn't it? Not anymore. Hi, Bobby: You're somewhere out there... ... on the deep blue, goddamn sea... ... and I'm writing this on a box of two semi-down pillows... ... that I secretly bought for us at Penney's. And I'm smiling to myself because... ... of the surprise I have in store for you. I'm talking removal from our dungeon in the Crow's Nest... ... to our own place. It's no great shakes... ... but you gotta begin with a baby shake, right? Forever love, Bobby. I'm in this for the long run. - I'm not intruding, am I? - You're not intruding. You're a natural. You've got some old salt in your blood. Thanks. You're a happy man out here, aren't you? Today, maybe. When do you get unhappy? The day we go home. Home? I thought the sea was your home. You got me there. But if you were gonna pin me down... ...I guess Pensacola, Florida is home. My ex lives there. Jodi. And my kids. I wasn't very good at doing things the way they're supposed to be done. Wife. Kids. A house with things in it. All that stuff. So why are you so happy? You just got me on a good day. I'm doing what I was made to do. And I got a feeling I'll do it even better this time. How about you? I got a woman I can't stand to be more than two feet away from. Congratulations. Then again, I love to fish. Son, you've got a problem. I know. Here you are. What do you think? Blue skies, scattered showers, same old, same old? - Your guess is as good as mine. - Or better. Watch it. This doesn't look good. Looks pretty ugly here too. Pam. Tell Bernie I need two graphics: Bermuda and Sable Island. Good. What's our course? I've been sailing 42 years. Never plotted a course. I set the compass, I ride it... ...we'll be in Bermuda in no time. Let's go fishing. All right, guys, let's hit it! 1000 hooks in the water before dinner. I want 40 miles out there. Three-mile buoy out! Yeah, baby. Set. Okay, Sully, put it out. Highflyer! Hey, A.P. May the force be with us. You want to play with lightsticks, stick them up your ass. Easy, Murph. He's dead weight. He's been screwing around all night. A juicer and a head. Cape Ann, bottom shelf. Yeah, well, your wife didn't feel that way. Hey, knock it off! I'll head for land and the Newfies will throw you both in jail! All right, cap. Give us some lights. Come on. Jesus. Shake, you guys. Shake! - Just let it go. - Your day is coming. Whenever you're ready. I'll be right up here. The job ain't hard enough without this knucklehead. Let's go. We're gonna make some money. Let's go, boys! Let's go! Come on! Come on. Do it, skip, do it. Make a killing. One's on. Fish on. Have those gaffs ready. Don't lose him, Murph. Don't lose him. Pull him in, Murph. All right, now, gaff him. Gaff him! One, two, three! Pull him in. Come on, a little bit more. So what do you think? Do you think he'll like it? He'll love it. Enough to live with me in it? By now, honey, you know him much better than I do. We're gonna make a go of it. I got confidence in you. What, are you putting me on? He's my precious boy. And you're the woman for him. That's something I don't joke about. The activity down near Bermuda is deepening rapidly. Given the warm and volatile Gulf Stream... ... it won't take much to turn this tropical storm into a hurricane. This just in, video of Sable Island. I put so much ground beef and sausage in this, it weighed out at 20 pounds. More than most of our fish weigh. Skipper say anything about us coming up short? He's too scared to say. Skipper don't get scared. Just disappointed. You know why this lasagna weighs 20 pounds? It tasted like you threw in a shot put. I once worked a site with a guy like you. The guy had a real bad accident. Can't even keep track of them with so many accidents at sea. Tough to get an ambulance too. Keep it up. Highflyer! A.P., give me a hand. Hey, how about a little hand over here? You do your job, I'll do mine. Come on, guys. Came out here for nothing. Keep moving, keep moving. Come on, Sully, let's get some bait going here. It's big. - Something very big. - Fish on! Come on, guys. Oh, yeah. Come on. Bring it up. Bring it up. Get the gaff! Get it out of here! Stick him. Stick it in his head! Good! Get him off! - He's got my leg! - Hang on! Kick your foot out! Kick it! Kick your foot out. Get back! All right, come on, get it out! Get it out of here. - Pull him back! - Over the side. You all right? You're short a boot, rookie! Beats a leg, don't it? Okay, we're getting a reading of winds over 140 knots sustained. Looks like a category 5. ""Billy Tyne is no fine wine He's lost his touch with our long line Steamed here and there and all about What's our tally? We've struck out"" All right, okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Why aren't you downstairs watching the movie? One of our three movies? I know them all by heart. Skip... ...what are you gonna do about those sets? They suck. We ain't doing nothing. The boys been talking? About how I lost it? Billy Tyne's lost it? Gets a little slow, they'll draw and quarter you. I just didn't think you'd go along with it. I come here because I need the money. I'm trying for a new start. Last trip I thought you had something to offer. But all in all, you're just a little punk. - You promised me a shitload of fish! - You'll get a shitload of fish. I've been in bad patches so many times and came home with so much stock... ...little boys like you had to pack it on the pier. I always find the fish! Always! And I will this time! So don't fuck with me! Aye, aye, skip. Put them closer! Murph, closer! Give them a goddamn banquet. Aye, aye, cap. You heard him, boys. Boss ain't happy. Double-time. Let's go, Bob. Sullivan! I gotta hit you with a fish again to get you to work? Lightsticks, now! Shut up, asshole! You couldn't bait fish in a barrel! - Come on. - See what I got to deal with? That's a landlubber. What an idiot! Come on, Sully. What are you, a fisherman or a farmer? Bugs, help him out. Hurry up, before the captain sees. Okay, sure, I'll help him out. What a screwup! - You're useless, Sully! - Lay off, Bugs. You never screw up? You're nothing but a pimple on the ass of progress. I've been on a better slab than this. I've had it with this. Take it easy. It was an accident. You got the easiest job on the boat, and you manage to screw it up! Kiss my ass, you little runt. And you...! Murph! Cap, man overboard! Take the wheel! Back her down slow. Come on, Murph. We've got Murph! Come on! You all right? You all right? Come on, Murph. Come on. Come on. How was the water, Murph? Welcome back, Murph! You did it, Murph. Hold on a minute. All right, bend over. Tetanus. Who's the hero? Bobby and Sully. Sully? Ladies and gentlemen, Dale Murphy out of Cortez, Florida. The only fish the Andrea Gail has hooked in three days. How you feeling? All right. - Bobby, thank you. - Don't worry about it. Sully was the first one to go in. So I guess you're the big hero here. Well, you'd have done the same for me. Isn't that what I'm supposed to say? Well, you can say what you want... ...but I'm glad you know how to swim. That's real big of you, Murph. It's all I can manage now. All right? I'll work on it. Tough guy. This weather fax just came in. Edie, have a look at this. We have got to head in now! Put it in at Watch Hill! In this stuff, harbor's too dangerous. Dangerous? Dash into shore, cut across shipping lanes... This is a hurricane coming straight at us! Let me reduce sails, Sandy, or even go back home. This is my boat. We'll ride this thing out. Not for fun, for safety. Do what I've always done: Go with the flow. Holy shit! Rogue wave! Look out! Everybody here? Captain, the boys would like to have a word with you. Take over. When this meeting's over, straighten this crap up. So what's the word? We're starting to get an unlucky feeling out here. Murph going over, the shark, a rogue wave... Yeah, what else? Never mind unlucky. We're just looking for some fish. We had slumps before, you and I, but nothing like this. You boys look like you got busted in a brawl in Scollay Square. That's how we feel. We want to go home. You want to go home? You lonely for that young mama who was all over you? My girl is none of your business. But you are. If you don't like it, get the hell off! All of you. I look around and all I see are little boys sitting on their asses... ...too scared to go and get some pay dirt. Pay dirt? What are you talking about? Where the hell is that? We covered the Grand Banks. The Grand Banks are west of us. I'm headed east. The Flemish Cap. The Flemish Cap? Why don't we steam to Portugal while we're at it? So this is the moment of truth. This is where they separate the men from the boys. How about it? - Are you Gloucestermen? - Yeah. But why go all the way to the Flemish Cap to prove it? Tell him, Alfred Pierre. That's where the fish are. Do we have any other choice? Yeah. Crawl home, busted. - All right, skip. - All right. All right. Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie, 6-6-8- 1, do you read me? This is Andrea Gail, Whiskey- Yankee-Charlie, 6-6-8-1. Hey, Linda. What's happening? Slim to none. Where are you? Tail of the Banks. Kicking up something wicked here. Made a couple of sets. You doing any good? Nine, first set. Twelve... No, make that a baker's dozen, second. Got a couple of markers to boot. Your hand is so hot, I can feel the heat from here. - I've asked you to team up. - I don't like partners. Business-wise, that is. Okay, okay. What's your position? 46 north, 48 west. You headed for the Flemish Cap? The lady knows her coordinates. Yeah, I'm steaming full-bore. The Flemish Cap is nearly off the charts. What are you trying to prove? We got gale-force coming out of Bermuda, stuff out of Sable Island. As for me, I'm staring here at solid white chop. This could be a triple-header. You're behind me. So is your weather. Yeah, but you've gotta go through it to get back. Good point. Billy, you won't like this, but I'm gonna say it anyway: You be careful. Yes, Mother. Why don't we pick this up later? I'm out. - You guys use some company? - Sure. - Coffee? - Yeah, thanks. - In the mid-Atlantic, moving rapidly northeast... ... 30-foot waves. What'd you hear? They're out on the Flemish Cap. I got it straight from big Bob Brown. Yeah. The Flemish Cap. I went there, '62. Lots of fish. And lots of weather. Hurricanes... ...squalls, huge seas. You're full of shit, Quentin. That's right. I am. - Where are you going? - To point this boat up into the storm. And scream for help! We lie ahull, beam to the waves, slip sideways. Standard procedure. Forget it, we won't make it! Missy, get on the radio now! - We can make it. - Mayday! It's sopping wet! She'll be weeping in the wind. No! We stay below and ride this thing out. Remember, this is my boat! This is my life! Go, Melissa! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! We're a 32-foot sailing vessel, Mistral. Our position is... ...39.49 north... Mayday! Mayday! Over. Hey, cap! Ice machine's had it. It's dead. - Check the evaporator? - Yeah. - Freon? - Plenty, but nowhere to flow. Use some spit and glue. I did. She's fried, skip. I told Brown, get us a new one... ...but he gets another overhaul, son of a bitch! Sorry. The ice machine's gone. Oh, fuck. All right, we got good ice on them now. We seal the fish hold. With luck, we'll deliver the catch and set the market. Pull up the gear. We're going home. Put these babies on ice, and we're out of here! We are taking heavy waves. Damage on deck. Need immediate assistance. We're beam to the sea and taking on water. Just so you understand what we're up against. We're looking at 40 to 50-foot waves, gale-force winds. A real bad one. Right in our path. The Weather Service is jerking off again. No. You're afraid? I never seen you scared. It's pretty rough stuff out there, that's for sure. We either hang out here for a few days till it calms down... But, cap... ...we got 60,000 pounds of fish here. Are we gonna let it spoil? I thought we were gonna set the market, make a killing. Or we say the hell with it. We drive right through it. You said we're Gloucestermen. What do you say, guys? Are we or aren't we? Did we come out here for nothing? - It's a lot of money. - Let's make some money. Come on. Let's hear it, Gloucester! Let's get her lashed down. Bugs, put the birds in the water. Birds in. Got it, skip. Look. Look at this. We got Hurricane Grace moving north off the Atlantic seaboard. Huge... ...getting massive. Two, this low south of Sable Island, ready to explode. Look at this. Three, a fresh cold front swooping down from Canada. But it's caught a ride on the jet stream... ...and is motoring hell-bent towards the Atlantic. Cool. Wait, wait. What if Hurricane Grace runs smack into it? Add to the scenario this baby off Sable Island, scrounging for energy. She'll start feeding off both the Canadian cold front... ...and Hurricane Grace. You could be a meteorologist all your life... ...and never see something like this. It would be a disaster of epic proportions. It would be... ... the perfect storm. Let's get down below. Bobby? I want you up here with me. Mayday! Mayday! Sailing vessel Mistral, this is Coast Guard rescue. Sandy! Edie, they heard me! They're coming! Air Force rescue 2-3- 1. We've located the Mistral. Position: 39.49 north... ... 69.52 west. How far's that last position? About 20.3 miles, captain. OD, boatswain on the bridge. Tallyho, there they are. - Okay, guys, showtime. - You got it. Mistral, this is 2-3-1. We're gonna extract you one at a time from the deck. Hey, Jeremy, I don't like this. - Clock's ticking. - Come on, we better get them off now. Get closer, Darryl. Just a little closer. Okay, deploying the basket. Close to 2:00. Let's come right to 5. - Four. Three. - Son of a bitch. Stop there. Hold your hover. Goddamn it! Keep it steady, keep it steady. Shit! Man out! - Shear the cable! - No, I got it! Shit. Bring up the basket! Sandy! Hold on! I got you! - Basket's in. - Looks like I'm going for a swim. Okay, go get them. Mitchell off intercom. It's time to get wet. We're gonna be all right. Go. Altitude. Altitude. Get her up, get her up! He's in the water. I'm going after him! No, no, wait! Stand by! Jonesy, hold on. There! He's okay. This isn't working. They'll have to get in the water. Come on, come on! You're having a blast, huh? - Want a turn? - No, just watch. I want to watch. I'm studying up for the day I get my own boat. Your own boat, huh? Want to give me a hand? Grab the throttle. Hang on. - Ah, shit! - Seven K, six easy. - Eight minimum. - Ten. You know, I'm gonna get me a new used Ford F-150... ...take a ride to Digby with Irene. Going to get drunk, eat like a pig and sleep like a child! Fish and fun-gee! Okay, Jer, too risky to go lower. You gotta jump from here. Good afternoon, madam. I'm Sergeant Jeremy Mitchell. I'll be your para-rescue jumper today. How are you? Okay so far. Keep your hands and feet in the basket. - Careful. - Okay! All right, here we go. You're next. That was nothing! Come on! Oh, my God. It's happening. Andrea Gail, Andrea Gail. This is Hannah Boden. - Billy, over. Calling the Andrea Gail. Andrea Gail, do you read me? Do you read me? Come in! Come in, for God's sake, come in! Billy, these storms have collided! They are exploding! Who is it? I don't know. Andrea Gail, come in! Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1, over. Talk to me, Billy, over. I repeat, Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1... Look at your fax, damn it! Look at your fax! Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1, over! - Where are you, Billy? - Linda? Give me the coordinates. - 44 north, 56.4 west. - We're 44 north... ... 56.4 west, headed west. I repeat, 44 north, 56.4 west, headed... Over. Billy, get out of there. Come about! Let it carry you out! What the hell are you doing? Hang on! Billy! Billy, for chrissake! You're steaming into a bomb! Turn around, for chrissake! It's the antenna. Billy, can you hear me? You're headed right for the middle of the monster. Oh, my God. Hang on! Take the wheel. No, I'll go. Mayday, mayday, mayday... ...Coast Guard Boston. This is fishing vessel Hannah Boden relaying a mayday... ...for swordboat Andrea Gail. Last position, 44 north... ...56.4 west, over. Advise you proceed to next incident at your discretion, over. Yeah, roger, Boston. I just got a mayday on a Gloucester swordboat, the Andrea Gail. 44 north, 56.4 west, headed west. Jesus. That's straight into hell. Gloucester. They're always from Gloucester. It's an increased-risk mission, so, you know, it's up to us. I'm getting a little air-to-air feeling. Refuel in hell? That's pretty sporty. Call the cutter. We're coming in hot. People, slight change of plans! We're gonna drop you on the Coast Guard cutter Tamaroa. We got some swordfishermen who have lost their way. Or their minds. This is rescue 2-3- 1 on final approach. Rescue 2-3- 1, flight deck is green. There it is. You're being waved in. Thirty meters and closing. Twenty-five meters, winds 43. Set a line at 0-1-0. Beautiful. We're coming. Watch this wave, cap. 2- 3- 1, looking good. Transfer at will. Drop ladder. All right, send them down. Put your foot out. Left leg out. Mind your helm, goddamn it. Watch the deck! Come on. First survivor on deck. - Where's our fuel? - Refueling tanker is on the way. Second survivor on deck. Jesus. It's gone. No antenna, no radio. We're back in the 19th century. You want to call it quits, turn around? What do you think? I think she's a hell of a boat. With a hell of a crew. And a hell of a skipper. All right then, Gloucester... ...we're coming home! Take the wheel! Skipper, don't! Take the goddamn wheel! That's an order! Damn, I can't see anything. What's the gauge say? It's low, Jonesy. Where are they? - Tanker's on the way. - How many stops are they making? No! Come on! Not again. Hello? Ethel, thank God! I'm going crazy here. Even the weather guy's gone bananas. Have you heard from...? Hello? Ethel? Shit! There she is! Thank God. Let's fill her up, save these yahoos and get out of here. King 1-2, we have visual. Air Force rescue 2-3-1, you've got a wet hose. All right now, hold on! In the water! Hold on, skip! Shit. Come on, skip! Come on, skip, come on! Yeah! Anything yet? Nothing about boats. - I got four nines. - He's a liar. Florence. Damage estimates are in the high millions. Folks, the worst is yet to come. The storm of the century. Residents, stay inside, pack sandbags against door frames. A report here that Cape Ann fishing industry is in tatters. Lobstermen from Gloucester to Scituate have lost their traps. A missing swordboat, Andrea Gail, out of Gloucester with a crew of six. An Air National Guard rescue helicopter has been dispatched. At Logan International Airport, flooded runways. We did it! - Get those windows boarded up! - All right, skip. Come on, board it up! Tell those guys forget it. We'll get our gas somewhere else. What do you think? We're running on fumes. King 1-2, this isn't gonna work. This is not our night. We're issuing a mayday. Give the Coast Guard our coordinates. We're ditching. Mayday, mayday, Air Force rescue 2-3-1 calling Coast Guard Tamaroa. Mayday, mayday, Air Force rescue 2-3-1 calling Coast Guard Tamaroa. King 1-2, departing the area. Come on! Let's get it up! All right, guys, get ready! Hold on! Get it up there! Get another one. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Grab them, grab them! Hang on, there's a swell! Come on, guys, try to get you close. - Stay together. - Roger that. Number 1 is out! Bail! Bail out! - Leave yourself enough time, okay? - I'll be fine. Go, Jonesy, go! You're next. Hold on, hold on! Now, Jeremy, now! Go! Bail out! See you, Darryl. No, no, no, no. No! Over here! We're over here! Have you seen Mitchell? No. What about Jonesy? Nothing. Just you. Goddamn it, we don't lose anybody! Come on, lay it on. - Get it locked! - Get them on! They're not gonna make it! Tell them to hold on. I'll turn the boat. Right now, let's go! Come on, guys, you can do it! It's jammed! It's jammed! Lock it down! I can't hold her! Come on, get it up. Put it on now! Come on, this is it. - Get it on. - I'm trying! Get it on. It's loose. I got it! Man overboard! - What?! - Two over the side. Come on, help me! Hold on, I got you! Grab the line! Oh, God. We lost Bugsy! Bugsy! Hold on. Grab this. Hold on! Come on, Bugsy. Grab it! Grab it! Bugsy! There! Right there! Come on, let's go! I'm here, Jeremy, I'm here. I got you. We're here. Hey, talk to me, J. Talk to me. I'm all busted up, cap. Can't breathe. - Hey, Mitch, have you seen Jonesy? - No. Go find him. Go find Jonesy. Go get him. Boys, that's it. We can't make it. We're turning around. Come on, cap, we can do it. What about our catch? We'll mug them next time. This piece of water belongs to us. The fish will gather again for the Andrea Gail... ...when we come back. This is gonna be the turnaround of all time. Textbook. So get ready. If it were good news, he would've called us. The news is the rescue helicopter had to ditch. We can't raise the Andrea Gail. What does that mean? We don't know anything. If anyone can survive this storm, it's Billy Tyne. I'll give him that. What do you want? Credit for having the guts to walk in here? I do. Give it to him. How you doing, Quentin? Pretty good, governor. You're counting your money. And my guy is out there risking his life for a bunch of stupid fish. That's the game. I hate the game. I hate the goddamn game! Do you hear me?! Do you read me, governor? Do you?! Do you read me?! Did you see him? I don't see anything! Look! There's the cutter. - Have them put out the cargo net. - Cargo net, aye, sir. Put me alongside them. I want five men on that net. And get the light out there. Okay, guys, hook in! Pick it up! Move! Keep your light on those swimmers! Get ready! Release the net now! Okay, now, Jeremy, swim! Swim! Give him a hand! Get ready! Come on! All right! Let's do it again. If they can't get to us, we'll get to them. Go up swell and drift down. Broadside, captain? Isn't it too dangerous? It's too hairy. I won't let two men drown! Hold on, Jer. Just hold on. When I say now, you go full throttle. Got it? We only get one chance at this. And then? We pray. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Now! Faster! We did it! Guys, we're alive! We made the turn! We did it! Hey, skip, I'm giving you notice. This is my last trip. When we get back, I'm going right to Salisbury Beach with Chris. We're riding those go-carts, full-time. What do you think, skip? We're doing 12 knots. We keep this up, make it through till dawn... ...we might get out of here. They're coming around, Jeremy. I can't make it, cap. They're coming for you. You're wrong, Jer! They're coming for us. I'm not gonna leave you here, Jer. You have just one chance to grab ahold of those nets. - You roger that? - Okay. - Back full! - Back full on! You gotta swim now, Jer! Grab it, Jer, just grab it! Come on! Climb! Climb! Reach! We lost one! Pick up the net! Come on! Give me your hand! Reach and grab it with everything you got. Everything you've got! Hold on! Pull! Yes! Get them inside and clear this deck. All right, let's go. There's another man out there! There's another man! Jonesy! Jonesy! Skip, we're gonna make it. She's not gonna let us out. No. Come on, you bitch! Come on! Come on! Come on. We gotta get out. How do we do this, skip? No school for it. Never was. This is gonna be hard on my little boy. Bobby... ...l'm sorry I got you into this. Skip, we made the right call. We had to try. We were so close. It was a hell of a fight, though, huh? Let's get out of here, huh? Christina. Christina, can you hear me? I don't know if you can, but I'm talking to you, baby. Do you know how much I love you? I loved you the moment I saw you. I love you now... ... and I'll love you forever. No goodbye. There's only love, Christina. Only love. It's been a week of round-the-clock flights involving... ... efforts of half a dozen Northeast air rescue stations. However, as of this hour, the Coast Guard has suspended its search... ... for Air National Guard para-rescue jumper Millard Jones. He leaves a wife and three daughters. The search for the Andrea Gail out of Gloucester... ... has also been suspended after aircrafts covered... ... 116,000 square miles of ocean... ... without finding a single survivor. We'll have more news after these messages. I knew Billy Tyne. I did not know his crew very well. But any man who sailed with him must've been the better for it. Robert Shatford... ...Dale Murphy... ...Michael Moran... ...David Sullivan... ...Alfred Pierre... ...may you rest easy, long-liners... ...in fair winds and calm seas. For those of us left behind... ...the unmarked grave which is home for those lost at sea... ...is of no consolation. It can't be visited. There is no headstone on which to rest a bunch of flowers. The only place we can revisit them... ...is in our hearts or in our dreams. They say swordboatmen suffer from a lack of dreams. That's what begets their courage. Well, we'll dream for you... ...Billy... ...Bobby... ...and Murph... ...Bugsy... ...Sully... ...and Alfred Pierre. Sleep well. Good night. I'll be asleep... ...and then all of a sudden, there he is. That big smile. You know that smile. And I say, ""Hey, Bobby, where you been?"" But he won't tell me. He just smiles and says: ""Remember I'll always love you, Christina. I love you now, and I'll love you forever. There's no goodbye. Only love."" And then he's gone. But he's always happy when he goes. So I know he's gotta be okay. Absolutely okay. I love your dream. The fog's just lifting. You throw off your bow line, throw off your stern. You head out the South Channel... ... past Rocky Neck, Ten Pound Island... ... past Niles Pond, where I skated as a kid. You blow your horn and wave to... ... the lighthouse keeper's kid on Thatcher Island. Then the birds show up. Black-backs and herring gulls... ... big dump ducks. The sun hits you. You head north, open up to 12. You're steaming now. The guys are busy, you're in charge. You know what? You're a goddamn swordboat captain. Is there anything better in the world?, He's in the other room. - Are you Thomas Gates? - Yes. We got something that we'd like you to take a look at. I hear you're quite good with puzzles and riddles. - It's a coded message. - It's a Playfair cipher. - Playfair cipher? - Can you decode it? Cipher's impossible to decode without the key. - What do you mean by ""a key""? - A keyword or phrase. I believe what you need is right there. It'll take some time. Go on. I'll take your diary. I'll meet up with you later. Whoa. ... calculate the distance and you're sure to hit the mark in about most things as well as shootin'. ...ready to pour out all over you like apple sass over roast pork. I'll take care not to give up my hold on poor De Boots till I am quite sure of the American. Ah, that's my own girl. Augusta, dear, to your room. ... to turn you inside out, old gal, you sockdologizing old man-trap. Sic semper tyrannis! Temples. Gold. Cbola? This is a treasure map. KGC? You're Knights of the Golden Circle. You're a traitor. You're all traitors. - President Lincoln's been shot! - Everybody, out! All of you! Killer's on the loose! I'd much appreciate it if you'd finish deciphering that code now. - Dad! - The war is over. No! - No! - No! You're wrong about that. The war has only just begun! Charles. The debt that all men... men pay. The debt that all men p... Dad! No, please! Come back. It's not fair. Help! Somebody help, please! So recapping: The Knights of the Golden Circle was a Southern extremist group, operating in the north to subvert Union forces. Had Thomas not burned the legendary missing pages from the Booth diary, the killers may have found a vast treasure of gold, and the Union may well have lost the Civil War. Thank you. I'd like to thank Ben and Patrick Gates. Thank you. And say what a wonderful addition Thomas Gates is to our civilian heroes exhibit. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Nichols. I only wish my grandfather had been here to see this wonderful day. Excuse me. I have a question I'd like to ask. What do you think happened to that Booth diary page - that was pulled out of the fire? - We may never know. Perhaps. Perhaps not. You see, I have one of those great-great-granddaddies, like you, way up in my family tree, name of Silas Wilkinson. He used to tell a story about the night Lincoln was shot. As Silas tells it, Booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates regarding the treasure map that night. It was Thomas who called the meeting. A meeting to plan the assassination of Lincoln. - How absurd. - That's a lie! Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you... ...one of the missing pages from the infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth with the name Thomas Gates written on a list along with all the other killers. - And Latin? - Booth was a student of Latin. He shouted, ""Sic semper tyrannis"" after he shot Lincoln. - ""Thus always to..."" - ""Thus always to tyrants."" We know. - ""Surratt, copiae""? - Military supplies. Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged for supplying Booth with a rifle and field glasses. - ""Thomas Gates, artifex."" - ""Designer"" - or ""mastermind."" - I know what it means. He must have, uh, planned the assassination. - I see. - Could mean mastermind of anything. You see that? Burned out right there. I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you. - May I, Mr? - Wilkinson. I'll see if this new page matches the Booth diary. This is an outrage. You're calling my grandfather a liar. With respect, now you're calling my great-great-granddaddy a liar. Yes, sir, I am. This isn't some garbage from a history book. My grandfather told me this story himself. - I saw the truth of it in his eyes. - I'm sorry, sir. I truly am. We'll test this thoroughly, Patrick, to authenticate it. It can't be. Maps to presidents' houses. Keys to locks that don't exist. What's the point? What am I looking for? Proof, proof, proof. What proof? Oh, wow. Is this a book about the Templar treasure? Yes, it is about the Templar treasure, but it's also about other things. Conspiracy theories, urban legends and other myths that are true. - So the author's here signing copies? - I'm the author. - You are? - Yeah. See, uh... There's a picture of me right there. I think it's a pretty good picture. I thought that guy, Benjamin Gates, found the treasure. Well, yes, Ben did, but I am the co-finder. - Oh, I've never heard of you. - Oh! Oh, my gosh. Are you Ben Gates? - Yes. Yes, I am. - Do you own a red Ferrari? - Yes, I do. - Well, it's being towed. Hm? Wait! Wait! That's my car! Where's the Ferrari? - IRS impounded it. - The IRS? Funny story. My accountant set up a corporation on an island that didn't exist and assured me that that's how rich people do it. Then I got audited and slapped with a huge fine plus interest. Wanna know what taxes are on five million dollars? Six million dollars. But enough about me. What's new with you? Well, my girlfriend kicked me out, I'm living with my dad, - my family killed President Lincoln. - All right. I need your help. I can't believe you have to break into your own house. I need to get Abigail's ID. She has access to the Booth diary page. Why don't you ask Abigail for her help? She changed the alarm code, Riley. She's not going to talk to me. All right. We have 30 seconds after the alert starts to disable the alarm. Go. I'll probably regret asking this, but what happened with you and Abigail? I don't know. I don't know. She started using the word ""so"" a lot. ""So?"" Yeah, like, ""So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter."" ""So, you seem to always know what's best."" ""So, I guess I'm invisible."" Now I've moved out, we're dividing furniture... Oh. Women. Can't live with them, especially if they change the alarm codes. You did that in 25 seconds. That's why I tell people to get a dog. - Got it. - All right, let's go. That's not Abigail's car. She was on a date. Isn't that that guy? The White House guy? The White House Easter Egg Roll is next Monday. Maybe if you're not... He's weird! What happens if kids don't find all the eggs? Wow. You work in a museum, and you live in one. Pretty much. What clever repartee. She must like him. All right, let me give you a tour of the house. - OK. - That's actually kind of... Oh, Abigail. - What are you doing here? - I just needed to get some things. - Connor, good to see you again. - Gates. How did you get in, Ben? Riley! Come out here! What? Hey! What are you doing here? I mean, it's your house, but... I sent you a copy of my book. Did you get a chance? - No, I haven't read it yet. - Mm. I know you. You're the White House curator. - I'm Riley. We met, uh, back in... - Right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant. What? Um, maybe I should go. - Yeah, I'm really... - Dinner tomorrow night? I... I actually already have plans for tomorrow. You do? - Of course you do. - But I'm free on Friday. - Awkward. - Oh, great. - Good night. - Good night. I cannot believe you broke in. - What did you take? - It's just my things. Hand it over, Ben. I need to see the Booth diary page. You saw the page yourself. There is no treasure map on it. No, it's a cipher leading to a map. Anyone spectral-image the page? No need to. The ink writing on the page is clearly visible. It could have been erased or faded. You're the director of document conservation. You know this. Not up to me. It's not my department. That department reports to your department. Come on. One look under infrared. You can have the Boston Tea Tables. Both of them? We've been looking at this page for hours. There's nothing there. Ben, I really don't think we're going to find anything on this page. In a hundred years, no one's going to remember anyone involved in the Lincoln assassination besides Booth. That's not true. Do you know the expression, ""His name is mud""? - Yes. Of course. - You do? - You know the origin of the expression? - Does anyone but you? Dr. Samuel Mudd was convicted of being a co-conspirator in the Lincoln assassination. The evidence was circumstantial. He was later pardoned, but it didn't matter. Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And I will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud. - Ben. - What? Look at this. - See that? - Oh. - That's quite something, isn't it? - Yeah. It says ""smudge."" It's nothing. Residual ink from the facing page. Flip it. The letters are backwards. - It's a cipher. - Yes. It is. A cipher. See how the letters are coupled? Playfair ciphers encode letters in pairs. This could prove his story. Unless you decode the cipher, this does not prove a theory. That's OK. We need a five-letter keyword. - What's the keyword? - I don't know yet. - All right. - Uh, can I get a printout of this? There's a billion words in the English language. Got to be a logical... Let's start from the beginning. A. Aardvark. Don't want to rain on your parade here, but I don't think this is gonna stop Dr. Nichols from announcing the discovery of the page tomorrow. No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to wait until I prove Thomas is innocent? What if he isn't innocent? Sir? Looks like our old friend Ben Gates is in the news again. What did he find now? Atlantis? A guy came forward with a missing Booth diary page. That's not the best part. Listen to this. ""On the page are the names of the conspirators in the Lincoln assassination, as well as a previously unknown conspirator, Thomas Gates. Thomas Gates is said to be the great-great-grandfather of treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates."" - Thought my relatives were bad. - What do we know about this Wilkinson? - Sir? - Guy claims he had this page for 140 years then just suddenly comes forward with it? - Why? - We'll find out. Better. Better. Bacon. - Keep going. - That's stupid. - How's he doing? - Keep working. We're grateful to the Wilkinson family for coming forth with the page. On the page is a name of a previously unknown conspirator, Thomas Gates. - Nichols has bought into it. See? - Would you stop watching that. It's on the Internet! - No stopping it now. - Gates may have been the architect... - They have no understanding. - You know the truth. That's all that matters. You heard the story from Grandpa. The story? This guy's got evidence. He's got everything. We have a story. We have nothing. For one brief moment, the Gates family could hold its head up. - Now we're a bunch of crazies. - But we're not liars. Wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates was a mastermind to one of the darkest hours in U.S. history. And he burned the diary page to cover that up. You and I both know he burned the page to keep Booth's men from finding the treasure. That's what we're going to prove. - Only one way to prove it. - Find the treasure. You've got to find it. You're going to help me find it. So come on. Let's hear the story again from Grandpa Charles. Grandpa heard his father say, ""Treasure map."" - Then there was a commotion. - Got all that. Anything after that? Anything he said, something he did? Anything at all? - Wait a minute. - What? He took his son's hand. He looked him in the eye, and he said, with his dying breath, - ""The debt that all men pay."" - ""The debt that all men pay""? The debt that Thomas paid. That's five letters. Oh! Try ""Death."" - What? - It's the keycode. The debt that all men pay is death. All right. L-A-B-O-U-L... It's Lab-ool... Lab-ahl... La... It's gibberish. - Laboulaye! - Laboulaye! - What is that? - It's a who. douard Laboulaye. Where's the phone? I don't know. Can't find anything in this mess. - Temporary till I find a new place. - Find the old one. I like her. - Hi. - Dr. Chase. - Abigail, please. - Abigail. - Nice to meet you. - Have a seat. Thanks for agreeing to meet with me. Of course. I was actually going to call you about the diary page. - Any news? - Well... We actually found some latent letter fragments on it. Take a look. Random letters. A cipher? - Maybe. - Gates seen this? He's the one that discovered it. - I'm sorry. - Not a problem. - I need one minute. - Please, take your time. Hey. What? We cracked the cipher. It's ""Laboulaye."" The cipher spells ""Laboulaye."" So? Laboulaye was well-known in France. It could be nothing. Or maybe there was a treasure map like Thomas Gates said there was, and Laboulaye had it. We only got a partial on the next word. L-A-D, lad... ladder... - L-A-D. - Aladdin! Aladdin? - Lady! - Thank you, Abigail! Laboulaye Lady. Do you know what Laboulaye was planning right around the time Lincoln was assassinated? OK, Ben, I've got to go. There's a map or a clue to a map on the Statue... - She hung up. - She took your call. That was good. - Dr. Gates? - Yes. Sounds like he cracked the cipher. I couldn't help but overhear. Laboulaye? As in douard Laboulaye? He seems to believe so, yes. Man who had the idea for the Statue of Liberty. You're saying there's a treasure map in the Statue of Liberty? Laboulaye was a Mason. They built clues into everything. Did you learn that from my book? - Have an interest in history? - Fascinated by it. Civil War, especially. My family's descended from Confederate General Albert Pike. He was a remarkable man. But, then again, what is history but a marker for the deeds of great men? A man only has one lifetime, but history can remember you forever. So the only question is, which Statue of Liberty? Exactly. Is there more than one? There are three, actually, Riley. One is in New York, one in the Luxembourg Garden. But he only referred to one as his ""lady."" But he only referred to one as his ""lady."" This is like, impossible, what you're doing. I'm glad you're enjoying it. Laboulaye had to leave a clue somewhere on here. Move in on the torch. Let me get there. It's not as easy as it looks. No. Believe me, I understand. Excuse me, officer. May I help you? Ah, American, eh? Of course you see no problem in disturbing everyone's pleasant morning - with your buzzing there. - Hey! You know how much our constitution was influenced by your man, Montesquieu? - You know Montesquieu? - Got it. Montesquieu, yeah. ""A government should be set up so that..."" ""...no man need be afraid of another."" - That's very good. - Thank you. - I'm astonished. - I got it, I got it. - I hope you read French. - May I? He's a cop. Um...""Across the sea these twins stand determined..."" - Resolute. - ""Resolute,"" yeah. ""...to preserve what we are looking for. - Uh... Laboulaye, 1876."" - Six. - It's a clue. - ""These twins stand resolute."" Let's see. Resolute twins. Resolute. Resolute. And then twins. Siamese twins? Siam? Trade routes between France and Thailand? That's ridiculous. HMS Resolute. A British ship that got lost in the Arctic in the 1800s. It was salvaged by American whalers, and then Congress sent it back to England. When the ship was finally retired, Queen Victoria had two desks made from its timbers. Voil. Resolute twins. - And where are those desks now? - The closest one is in London. How fast can we get to Buckingham Palace? Don't know. Why don't you ask your new best friend? He's going to call you a cab. OK? - Nice helicopter. Is that yours? - Yes, actually. It is. - OK, so you get the ticket. - Great. Mitch Wilkinson studied history at Virginia Military Institute. Graduated 1978. Ran a private security company which had contracts in Iraq during the invasion, and in the Congo in the late '90s. These are trained mercenaries as well as being black-market antiquities dealers. So why does a black market antiquities dealer... ...give up a rare Civil War artifact? Something he could sell to a private collector for a good deal of money? So the queen's office is here. The elevator shaft gets you close, but the only direct access is through security. - That should be exciting. - We got to get you in that room. - Hi, Dad. - Ben. It's Patrick Gates' phone. He's calling Ben. Give me that. The house was broken into last night. I was attacked. Call the police. I'm coming home. - What? - What good would that do? They didn't take anything. And besides, I'm fine. OK. We're in London. We're going to Buckingham Palace. We have an appointment with the curator tomorrow afternoon. - Son, just be careful. Goodbye. - Bye. Someone else is after the treasure. Of course someone else is after the treasure. - It's the axiom of treasure hunting. - We have to hurry and see that desk. We don't want to miss that appointment. - Hi. Ben Gates. - See security. They'll let you in. Wow. OK. It's teatime, chaps. Looking for the curator's office. Which way was it again? Follow the stairs round, then turn first left. Thank you so much. - Ben. - Abigail. - What's she doing here? - What're you doing? Your dad called me. Said your next clue was here. - She's really there? - Ben... - Drop her. Lose her. - I want to help. That's very nice, but it's a bad time right now. - A bad time, right now? - It's a bad time. OK, I just flew all the way to London to offer my help... - Remember the plan. - You don't need it? You're the one making a scene. - I... I'm not making a scene right now. - We want to make a scene. Well then, fine! If that's what you want, let's have it out now! - So subtle. - Let me guess? It's the wrong time. It's the wrong place. I'm wrong again! Wrong about us, wrong about Thomas Gates, wrong that you'd like the Queen Anne chair! You're wrong to assume I'd like the chair. You see? Everybody, listen to this. This is more interesting than that. She thinks that even when I'm right, I'm wrong! Isn't that right? Abigail, just because I answer a question quickly doesn't make it wrong. Not if the answer's something we need to figure out as a couple. - That's what couples do! - Sir. You and your missis, take it outside. Now look what you've done. You've brought the little bobbies down on us! You take the missis outside. I'm staying right here. - Ben! - Whee! - Good afternoon, sir. - Hello. - Been drinking, have we? - Just a nip. Popped down to the pub for a pint! Bit of all right! Going to arrest a man for that? Going to detain a blighter for enjoying his whiskey? - Enough. - Bangers and mash. Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie. - Sir! - Haggis! - That's it! Dismount the banister! - I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts! Here they are, standing in a row! Small ones, big ones, some as big as your head! That was brilliant. - What's wrong with being right? - Nothing. You should try it sometime. - You're saying that I'm never right? - I did not say that. Hoo! So I'm wrong again. - Now, see, there you are correct. - Capital. Topper. Your mother told me about you. - In here, please. - Why don't you just make a list of what's OK for me to say or not write something... - What's right or wrong... - You two, stay. - Right? - No! No, no, man. - Don't leave me in here! - That's great. Wow. What is going on? I'm sorry for getting you roped into this, but you were excellent. - Thank you. So were you. - When did you figure out - it was a fake argument? - When'd you figure out I was - arguing during the fake argument? - The middle. Where ""I assume I'm right."" Get us out. Which I don't get. If I'm right, after I assume I'm right, then I'm correct. When you get to a conclusion without asking, and you happen to be right, you got lucky. I get lucky a lot. So where does that leave me, Ben? You guys are so great together. - Want to know why I'm here? - Uh-huh. Think there may be a clue on the Resolute desk in the queen's study. Does that help? Don't understand why it's difficult for you to include others in your decisions. Just because you may know what my answer is going to be doesn't mean you don't have to ask me. Door number one, opening. OK. Let me try this out. Abigail, would you like to come with me, please? Yes. Thank you. Ridiculous. You're staying. - It's too dangerous. - I am so coming. - Door number two. - Door two, coming up. - You're not coming. - Call security. You should be near a service elevator. What are you doing? Are those for the queen? Queen's not here. There's no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor. - What are you doing? - See the desk, without you. - No. - Don't let her go. Abigail... All right. Get in. Get in. Get in! Hold this. Will you give me the flowers back, please? Yeah. - What? - Wearing the perfume I bought you. So? So I think it smells kind of pretty. - It's the flowers, Ben. - No, it's not. Let's go. OK, now turn left. - Dead end. - I mean right. Go right. - The flowers... petals... stamens. - Good. Good. Go, go. That's it. The Resolute desk. We're looking for... ...writing, patterns in the carvings. Could be anything. Hey, look at this. - ""Malcolm Gilvary, 1880."" - Hold on one second. Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary. He didn't make furniture. He made Chinese puzzle boxes. - Oh... - What? I think these drawers work like tumblers in a safe. OK, four drawers... Four-digit combination? What about a year? Uh, let me see. Queen Victoria, born 1819. So you go one... Eight. One. Nine. - Any luck? - OK... 1876 was on the inscription on the statue in Paris. Let's try that. One. Eight. Seven. Six. Uh-oh. New rules. These markings, like Incan or Aztec. I have never seen any symbols like this. I mean, this looks centuries older than Civil War. What do you think it means? I doubt it has anything to do with the plot to assassinate Lincoln. Uh-oh. Mayday. Mayday. Ben, get out of there. - Oi! Where are my detainees? - OK, let's make some noise. The fire alarm's gone off. Uh-oh. God save the queen. All units, go to action zebra. - What's going on? - Haven't the foggiest. Someone or something is causing this. - Check your primary stations. - This doesn't make any sense. Find the source terminal and check public areas four and eight. This way, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. Keep moving. Keep walking until you're on the other side of the fountain. - Excuse me, excuse me. Coming through. - I got them. They're at the main gate. - Oi! Sparkle. Come on. - OK. Here we go. I'm a little bit allergic. - Riley. - Thank you. OK. - See you later. Thank you. Bye-bye. - Sit! Sorry! Thanks for waiting for me. Can I see the thing? Daniel, hold it. What is that? Went to Buckingham Palace, all I got was this wood? Look at the symbols. Never seen anything like this. It's an incredible discovery. - Wilkinson. - Stop them. Go, go, go! - He's the one after the treasure. - I'll drive. We're in England. It's a gun! Get down! - We're trapped! - Hang on! Keep your heads down. Hey, who are you? Sorry. - Hey! - Oi! - Ben, they're getting closer. - What is their problem? Whoa! - Go left! Go left! - Hold on. Turn, turn! Watch out! Everybody OK? - Come on, come on. - Danny, I want them stopped. Look out! Ah! Ah! Go. Go, go, go, go! Did you see where he went? - What is that? Someone's phone. - It's him. - Have his number in your speed dial? - Oh, shu... This has to end before someone gets hurt. Give me what you got at Buckingham, it won't be necessary. Tell that to my father. Moron! Why are they standing in the middle of the street? - Where are these people going? - Why's everyone running? - He's right there! Go! - Move! Get out of the way! - Did I just run over a man's foot? - Watch the people! Go! Go! Faster! - Right over there. - I got them. - They're still behind us. - This phone have a camera? - No. No, it's broken. - All right. Give me the plank. Hang on. We're going to run a red light. Ah! Ah! Hack into the London Police database and get a picture from that traffic cam. - Okey-dokey. - You can't do it? No, I can. I just don't like that you assume that I can. Why, thank you, Riley. Get it! Stop! Stop! - He's got it. - What is it? I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go. I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go. - Abigail! - Hey, Patrick. Nice to see you two together again. - Yeah, well, we're not. - Yeah. Oh, I was hoping to get some of these boxes out of the house. I can't read the whole thing, but I can tell you that these are definitely pre-colonial Native American markings. - Easily 500 years old. - Easily. I can identify one symbol. Look at this. Do you know what that is? Sacred calendrical? I don't know. That symbol is Cbola. That's Cbola. The City of Gold. The City of Gold. ""In 1527, a Spanish ship wrecked on the Florida coast. There were only four survivors. One was a slave named Estebn who saved a local tribe's dying chief. As a reward, he was taken to their sacred city, a city built from solid gold. Later, when Estebn tried to find the city again, he never could. But the legend grew, and every explorer came to the New World in search of it. When General Custer's search for gold ended with his last stand at Little Bighorn, it became clear none would ever find it."" Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates got their hands on the City of Gold... My God. I'm going to go talk to her. - You're coming with me. - No! - Hey. No one else can translate it. - There are others. There are several others. For ancient Native American? No one better. - Who? - Look, Ben, I can't go with you. - It's been, what? Twenty-five years. - Thirty-two. That long? There's a reason why we haven't spoken in 32 years. - We have nothing in common. - Me? Yes, of course. And I'm sure she's just as proud of you as I am. - Who? - His mom. - Will you relax? It's gonna be fine. - Sure. Should look at the bright side. Been a long time. Maybe she lost her memory, won't recognize me. I hate her! We're in the right place. I'm gonna take myself out of the line of fire for this one. - Hi, Mom. - Benjamin! Abigail! What a surprise! Hello, sweetheart. Hi. Oh. You see? One syllable, a knife in the heart. - Oh, no. - She can do that. I can also track the whereabouts of my toothbrush. I was not the one that left the toothbrushes in Marrakech. I stowed them both in the travel case, as instructed. Yes, and you also insisted on loading the luggage into the taxi. - Didn't insist. I loaded the luggage. - Not the travel case. Travel case is not luggage. The case goes into the luggage. - Who was in charge of packing? - I couldn't get the case into the luggage. It was full with that stupid rug you bought. You thought it had secret stitching. - How stupid was that? - Did have stitching. - Six phony green leather suitcases... - Mom. I need you to take a look at this. - What is that a picture of? - It's interesting. - We think it might be Olmec. - It is. Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean. We were hoping that you could translate it. Yes, of course you were. Oh, this doesn't involve another treasure hunt, does it? Mom, this is actually very important. All right. What have we got here? This... this glyph here, that means ""bird."" And that means... Uh, ""noble bird."" ""Find the noble bird, let him take you by the hand and give you passage to the sacred temple."" Oh, you think this is a treasure map for Cbola, don't you? Well, that is exactly what it is. No, this glyph doesn't mean ""Cbola."" It means ""the center of the world."" You know, you used to like it. She fell in love with me on a treasure hunt. That was not love. That was excitement, adrenaline and tequila. - Mom... - I was trying to get course credit. Treasure hunting paid off, in case you haven't read the papers. Had nothing to do with you. That was Ben. Ben found the treasure. You did nothing. Patrick, Emily, please. Can we just figure out what's on the page? Well, that's it, I'm afraid. These glyphs are only partials. So you only have half a treasure map. I'm sorry. Not that I'm surprised. At least we know where the rest of the map is. What? You know where it is? Why didn't you tell me? Obviously you have a tendency to overreact! - I'm sorry. - So am I. So where is it? Inscription on the statue in Paris said, ""These twins stand resolute."" We think the map's divided between the two Resolute desks. The Resolute desk. The Resolute desk? President's desk? The president. What president? - Our president? - Unfortunately, yes. But that means... Wait, so we have to... The White House? The Oval Office... to be exact. Why would I overreact to that? - That's not what I signed on for. - Could we focus on the issue at hand? Thank you. It's early, pre-Columbian. - Can you translate it? - Are you kidding? This is an extinct, exceedingly rare language. Only a handful of people study these languages. Where are we to find them? Universities, I suppose. But you don't have the whole thing. What do you mean? These glyphs here... they're cut off. There's more to the map? How are we going to find that? We won't have to. Gates will get it somehow. The Resolute desk is near the south wall in the Oval Office. Look at this. Look. Small door on the front of the desk. FDR had that put in so guests couldn't see his wheelchair. - But... - Guys, take a look at this. This could work. I believe it's time for you to make a date with your new boyfriend. I think you're right. We hope you're enjoying the White House Easter Egg Roll. Face painting continues at 2:00 near the south fountain. - That Connor in the bunny suit? - Thank you. I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll. It's kind of sweet. Yeah, I love it. I know you. Your great-great-grandfather killed President Lincoln. No. That would be John Wilkes Booth. Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool in a greater conspiracy that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet. Absurd. Eisenschiml's book is filled with - spotty research and false assumptions. - Oh, yeah? Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard left his post that night? Because President Lincoln was never accompanied by guards when attending the theater. Listening? Especially on Good Friday. Explain why all the bridges out of Washington were closed except one, the one Booth needed to escape? OK, run along now, you impossible child. Run along. What is going on with the education in America? - Hey! Hey! - Connor! - I'm so glad you decided to come... - Hey. ...with Gates. - Connor. - We just ran into each other. - Oh. Aren't you going to ask him? - Ask me what? - Nothing. - No, really. What? - I really wouldn't want to impose. Well, what she means is she doesn't think you can. - Doesn't think I can what? - She wants to see the Oval Office. - No. That is way too much to ask. - No, it's, uh... - I can do that. - Really? You see? - You can? - Yeah. That is so cool, Connor. I have always wanted to see the Oval Office. Connor rocks. Well... here we are. - Mm. - Wow. Empire furnishings and crenelated molding. Love it. Hm. Amazing feeling, isn't it, standing in here? - Yes. Amazing, huh? - Oh, could... Oh. Sorry. Oh, that's, uh... The Resolute desk. Might recognize it from the photo of young JFK Junior playing underneath while his father was working. - Wonderful. - Yeah. But many people don't know that this desk has a twin that sits in Buckingham Palace. - Isn't that something? - Who knew? Every president since Rutherford B. Hayes has used that desk, except, uh, Johnson and Nixon. And Ford, of course. - Uh, no. - Uh, yes. - No. - Yes. Abigail! Did you lose an earring? Oh! I... I did, yes. Connor, these were given to me by my grandmother. I suppose we should look for it. Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring that doesn't belong to the first lady in the Oval Office. - Yes. - Excellent point, considering we're not supposed to be here. - Yeah. - Why don't we, um, go over here and check it out? I'll check over here. - Do you think it fell down here? - Yes. - Maybe here. - Probably. Oh, no. - You did sit on the sofa. - Oh, the bunnies. Connor! - You found it. - I did. Thank you so much! Uh... You're just the best. Mm. Mm! Mm! Mm! Thank you. OK. OK. - Empty. - Someone must've taken it. Brightest men in our country sat at that desk for over a hundred years. - Look. - Course one of 'em found the map. - A symbol stamped into the wood. - The presidential seal. It's not the presidential seal. The eagle's holding a scroll instead of olive branches. - I'm not sure what this is. - What do we do? Did none of you read my book? The eagle clutching the scroll. - Do you know what it means? - Yeah. But it's not something I could tell you. It's something that I have to show you... in my book. - You didn't even open it? - I was moving. Chapter 13. - ""The President's Secret Book""? - ""The President's Secret Book."" It happens to be a collection of documents for presidents by presidents, and for presidents' eyes only. And I'm not just talking about JFK here, guys. The 18 and a half missing minutes of the Watergate tapes. Did the Apollo really land on the moon? Did it? Did it? And the coup de grce... Area 51. Come on, Riley. That's... that's an urban legend. Is it, Abigail? Is it? It's just totally... - Crazy? - Yeah. Hm. 'Cause last time I checked, we pretty much make our living on crazy. - He's got a point. - I guess so. Same symbol. Released in '66 under the Freedom of Information Act. The eagle and the scroll, the secret symbol in the President's Book. So you're saying that whatever was on that plank is now in the President's Secret Book? Ben. If it was you trying to convince me... ...you'd have less evidence, and I'd already believe you by now. The eagle with the scroll? Conspiracy theorists like to believe that it's the symbol for the President's Secret Book. You bought Riley's book. Your friend writes a book about government conspiracies. - You don't think we know about it? - But is it true? Does the president have a secret book? Do you like ducks? There is a book. Why are you telling me out here? Because inside, I'm a federal agent. Out here, I'm talking to you as a friend. - Where's the President's Book kept? - Only the current president knows. The book is passed from president to president, and each one chooses his own hiding place. You're the FBI. Can't you get it for me? Only way you'll ever see that book is if you get elected president. Well, you never know. All I need is a few minutes with him. A few minutes? Really? Even if you were married to the president, you wouldn't be able to get a few minutes. Not when he's surrounded by handlers. If I get him alone... How do you expect to get the president alone? Before the Civil War, the states were all separate. People used to say, ""The United States are."" <u>Wasn't until the war ended people started saying, ""The United States is.""</u> Under Lincoln... we became one nation. And Lincoln paid for it with his life. - So did Thomas Gates. - Right. With his life. So how am I gonna get him alone? I'm gonna kidnap him. I'm gonna kidnap the president of the United States. - That's not funny. - I'm your father. How do you expect me to respond? I can't let you ruin your life. Are you out of your mind? Read my book, and you'd know you can't get to that book. Exactly how do you plan on doing this? - I was thinking Mount Vernon. - Oh. - I was thinking Mount Vernon. - Oh. - What? - I'm in. Sir, we have to move the party. Some historian claims the Spencer Landmark Hotel was used for Klan meetings in the late 1800s. - Anyone know if this is true? - I've got the Washington Gazette. They want a quote on, ""Is the president being insensitive to minority issues?"" - Doesn't matter. - Get a list of approved alternates. - What do you have? - Yeah, I know it's short notice. The pipe burst in the hotel that we previously booked. - I... There is water everywhere. - A retirement party for 200 people. - Gunston Hall. - Monticello is booked. So is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place. The Denby Hotel is available, and so is Mount Vernon. - Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver. - The Denby is great. Strike that. The Denby was booked. Mount Vernon's all we got. Book it before someone else does. And let me say what an honor it is to be here and add my happy birthday to you, Mr. President. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Are you aware that you are in a restricted area? Yeah, but this is where the fish are, son. That may be, but I'm gonna need to have you move upriver. Are you aware that according to article one, section 25 of the Maryland constitution, I'm allowed to fish in public water? Are you aware I have the right to detain you for the next 48 hours without cause? I am going to go back where I came from just as fast as possible. Maybe one day I'll wear this thing to a party I was actually invited to. Twenty hundred time check. Station 11. - All clear. Perimeter secure. - Hey. You didn't happen to see a cute brunette wandering around? - Went to get a drink, she disappeared. - No, sir. I've got no game tonight. Good evening, Your Excellency. Hello. Prime Minister, it's a delight to have you back in the States. Spread the word, contribution limits not enforced on the president's birth... - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - Ben Gates. The Templar treasure? - Oh, right, Ben Gates. Yeah. - We won't keep you. - Thanks so much. Always a pleasure. I can't tell you what a thrill it is for me to be invited here tonight, sir. Yeah, you must have the Secret Service hopping about now. Sir? Considering your discovered lineage. - Oh, yeah. Oh, that... - Carry on. I beg your pardon, sir, but I know what a huge admirer you are of George Washington. I thought you might want to take a look at this. Have a look at that. This is a map of Mount Vernon drawn by George Washington himself. Mr. President, that is exactly what it is. - Architectural history major, Yale. - I did not know that. It belonged to my great uncle. Got it from the granddaughter of a slave, Charlotte. - Happy birthday. - Always a pleasure. Thank you so much. Charlotte, who lived here and worked here at Mount Vernon. - Yeah. - And we're standing right here, sir. This line is an underground tunnel, an escape route that was never found. I wonder... I wonder if it's still there. Well... - Only one way to find out, sir. - Maybe we should take a look. Are we allowed to do that? I mean, I know you're allowed to do that. You're the president. Can I come with you? - You guys are just everywhere. - Yes, sir. - Give my friend your flashlight. - Thank you. According to this map, it should be... It's one... two. In here. Yeah, should be in here. - May I? - Absolutely. All right. You know, Craig, I appreciate you doing your job, but I have no enemies down here. In the cellar. In this tiny little room. I'll just wait here, then. Over here. - That's the mark of George Washington. - Only it's slightly different. - How? - These axes, the angle's off. For it to correspond with the ones on the map, it should form a perfect V. OK, what else? The arrowhead... ...is sideways. We're all right. Don't worry. Look at that. Come on. Mr. President? We have a breach in zone nine! There's... - Inform Fairfax, SecTac Channel One! - Perimeter detail, lock down all exits! - Gates, what are you doing? - I'm sorry, Mr. President. I need to ask you a question, which I know you can't answer - unless we're alone. - Two coming in! I want a sledgehammer, I want a crowbar, I want a jackhammer, now! Tom, alert the vice president. Mr. President, sometime between 1880, when the Resolute desk was placed in the Oval Office, and now, one of our presidents found a secret compartment in the desk. Hidden inside was a plank with Native American writing on it. A treasure map to Cbola, the legendary City of Gold, sir. All this just to ask me about a treasure map? That map is a key to proving Thomas Gates' innocence. I know for a fact that the plank is no longer in the Resolute desk. You've been in my desk too? I believe the whereabouts of that plank is now hidden... ...in the President's Book, sir. The book known only to our presidents. It contains all of our nation's secrets. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I saw the seal in the desk, sir. I know the map exists. You're not going to tell me how to get out of here - unless you get what you want. - The way out is that direction, and I'll show you. You don't negotiate very well, do you? No, sir. Mr. President! Where are my sledgehammers? I don't get you, Gates. You do all this, you're willing to go to prison, just to clear your ancestor's name. The way out is just down those stairs. Everything I am is because of my ancestors, sir. Thomas Gates gave his last full measure of devotion to his country to stop the KGC. When someone dies for their country, I believe they should be honored. ""Last full measure of devotion""? Lincoln is my favorite president, sir. No offense. None taken. He's my favorite too. Sir, I know the book exists, and my question is, ""Will you agree to let me see it?"" Even if something like that really did exist, why do you think I would actually just give it to you? Because it will probably lead us to the discovery of the greatest Native American treasure of all time. A huge piece of culture lost. You can give that history back to its descendants. And because you're the president of the United States, sir. Whether by innate character, or the oath you took to defend the Constitution, or the weight of history that falls upon you. I believe you to be an honorable man, sir. People don't believe that stuff anymore. They want to believe it. Nearest highway is that direction. You'll understand if we part ways here. - Gates. - Sir? The following conversation never happened. The book exists. - Where is it? - Where else do you keep a book? In the Library of Congress. X, Y, two, three, four, seven, eight, six. Thank you, sir. You'll also need to know three, seven, nine, four. Got it. - And, Gates... - Sir? Two hundred people know you held me against my will. I can't tell them why. Unless you find what you're looking for, you'll be charged with kidnapping the president. - You know what that means. - Yes, sir. Very much so, sir. - I want you to do something for me. - It would be a privilege, sir. Page 47. Just have a look at that. Riley, meet me at the Library of Congress in 20 minutes. OK. Sadusky. The president's been what? The president's been what? Gates. X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six. X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six. X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six. - Hey. - Hey. We're close. - Where do we start? - XY is the book classification code. Stands for special collections, which means very special books. - Where are they? - This way. We'll sneak in. This will be good. Here we go. XA... XM... Look. Do you have a code? Three-seven-nine-four. What did the president say the number was? Two-three-four-seven-eight-six. Two-three-six-seven... X-Y-two-three-three, two-three-seven-eight... Here. Two-three-four-seven-nine-one. - Two-three-four-seven-nine... - Seventy-six, 78... It's not there. Maybe someone checked it out. - Why send us here if there's no book? - He probably wanted us to get caught. Here. - What is that? - It's a six-dial combination lock. The location is the combination. The location is the combination. Yes. I was right. Well done, Mr. Poole. Eagle and the scroll. - Area 51! - Shh! - Kennedy assassination. - Shh! We don't have time. Yeah, it's true. Here. Wait. ""April 1865. Queen Victoria sends Pike two coded missives. The first is received. Contains information regarding New World treasure. The City of Gold."" Wait. The queen wanted to help the Confederacy? - A divided America'd have been weaker. - Needed cotton from the South. ""The second missive was thought to contain a Playfair cipher suggesting contact with Laboulaye, who'll hide clues before his death."" The cipher written into the Booth diary page that Thomas tried to burn. - The one we have. - Exactly. ""1880. Resolute desk arrives in Washington, sent by queen to President Hayes."" Look at that. Missing plank from the White House. Wow. Here's the final entry by President Coolidge. ""1924. I found a plank in secret desk compartment. Plank photographed and then destroyed. Borglum commissioned to destroy landmarks in sacred Black Hills mountains."" Borglum. Mount Rushmore? He carved Mount Rushmore to erase the map's landmarks in order to protect the City of Gold. Mount Rushmore was a cover-up. What is it? There's my tax dollars at work, coming to arrest me. Not coming for you, they're for me. Go to the car. - No! - Go! I'll meet up with you. This way. So Gates abducts the president, lets him go and heads to the Library of Congress? - Why? - Maybe he wants to check out a book. This way. All agents... - Dad. - Ben. Get out of there. I had to move the car. FBI, Secret Service all over the place. Calm down. I sent a picture of the plank to your cell. - You can do that? - Yes, I can do that. Did you get it? - I got it. - Look. - Take it to Mom for translation. - Why me? He say his mom could translate the plank? Find out who she is. - How are we going to find Ben? - I don't know. - Hold it! Who are you? - We work here. - IDs. - Here. We were told to evacuate. I don't know what's going on. - My car's parked... - One second I'm reading... - Special section for... ...a book, then we're rushed out... - Go ahead. - OK. Thank you. - Thank you for your help, officer. - Best of luck. Have a good night. Hey, go to the northeast sectors... Start the car. Put it in gear. - Uh-oh. - What's the problem? It's clear. Let's go! We're going to jail. I want to run a check... Get in! Hang on! Mercedes SUV... - He's in! Go! - Hang on! Whoa! OK. We can do this. Close the barricade, lock it down! Lock it down! - Drive, drive, drive! - OK. I don't think so! Whoa, whoa! Go, go, go, go, go! Let's go! Let's go! That did not turn out the way it was supposed to! - How'd they find us so quick? - I'll tell you how. - The president is a tattletale! - Sadusky. He was there. He knows more about the book than I thought. How'd the president feel about being kidnapped? How'd the president feel about being kidnapped? He was OK. - Dr. Appleton. - This office is closed. I'm sorry. I do apologize for the lateness of the hour. My name is Mitch Wilkinson. I've got something I want you to take a look at. Just take a minute. - You're a treasure hunter. - No, ma'am. I'm just a man trying to make his mark on history. Can you help me? Um... No, I don't know that language. I'm sorry. I can't help you. Oh, excuse me. Yes. Got it. Your ex-husband's on his way up. He wants the translation. Tell him anything but the truth. Get rid of him. His life depends on it. Emily? I know I'm the last person you want to see, and I'm not comfortable either, but we need you to translate something. - Ben sent me. He needs your help. - Yes, of course. If it's for Ben, of course. What is it? Oh. Uh... It's in the cell phone. I'm not sure how to... - Give it to me. ...bring it out. We know it leads to Mount Rushmore. Yes. ""Islands... Islands of stone in a sea of grass."" That's what the Lakota used to call the Black Hills in South Dakota. Right. ""Find where the moon touches the earth and release the hummingbird."" That's it? Did it ever occur to you? I can't believe I'm saying this. Did it ever occur to you that I did the things I did to impress you? No, you did it because you wanted to, and I would've done the same thing, except one of us had to grow up and stay home and look after Ben. Certainly wasn't going to be you. Did it ever occur to you that I made sacrifices for us that you never did? No, of course not. So just go away. Lousy tequila. Don't feel bad. You did good. Patrick believed every word you said. Besides, your son would have never found the treasure anyway. You don't know Benjamin. Perhaps not. But then again, I have this. A letter from Queen Victoria to the Confederate General Albert Pike? Seems the dear old queen was partial to the Confederate cause. This has been handed down by my family for 140 years. Contains a vital piece of information. The final clue, as it were. This piece of information is worthless without your translation of the planks. It's ironic, isn't it? This all began with the burning of pages, and now it ends with the burning of this, the final clue. Making me the only one... ...who can find Cbola. ...who can find Cbola. Get your coat. Her translation on the second half of the planks says - we need to find an island of stone. - Ben would have found it by now. I don't think so. How do I get to, um, this... Hello, Mitch. Mom... - Wait for me. - No way. You're too slow. I knew you'd figure out the message I gave your father. The hummingbird was good. Let her go. We're the ones with the firepower, and you're giving me orders. I kidnapped the president. The FBI is on their way right now to arrest me, and I'm sure they'll love to meet you. They'll find us both and arrest us both. That path doesn't lead to the City of Gold, does it? This man has information you need. He's got a letter. From Queen Victoria to General Albert Pike. - How do you know that? - I read about it, in a book. I'm afraid he's burned it. All right... You've had me do all the work so far, why stop now? You tell me what you know, I'll find the City of Gold, prove Thomas Gates' innocence, you can have the treasure. - What? - I'm going with you. But if anyone's gonna be credited for discovering the City of Gold, it's going to be me. But your partners stay here, and all the guns. What makes you think I'd agree? Because you need that treasure. Believe me, I know. All right, Gates. We'll do it your way. But believe me... I don't need the guns. - Which president? The president? - I thought it best not to tell you. I still don't see anything that looks like a noble bird. All right. Let's have it. What did the letter say? What's the clue from Queen Victoria's letter? ""The entrance shall only be revealed under a cloudless rain."" Figure that one out. So we come back when it's raining? ""Cloudless."" Could simply mean the sun. You need a sunny day... and rain. We need water. Water. Abigail. Everybody, the water makes the rocks darker. Use the water. Em? Water? - What's this in my hand? Are you blind? - Good, good, good. This is ridiculous. Are we going to water the whole thing? That's it. Oh! That's it. I found it. Over here! Found it! Over here! Look at this! It's an eagle. - Look at that. It's an eagle. - There it is. - ""The noble bird..."" - ""Will give you passage."" - Uh-huh. Now what? - We need to join hands, and in a noble manner, pass over the bird. - It indicates direction... - Somehow that bird... ...will rise from the rock and kind of caw... You can stand around guessing for a while, or I can give you the next clue. ""Surrender your hand to the heart of the warrior."" And the eagle is a symbol of the warrior. Ben, no. Wait, wait! No. That's probably a horrible trap. Tell him! It's a horrible trap. It would be a pity to come this far and not even try, now, wouldn't it? I'll do it, Ben. It's OK. Surrender your hand. - I am sorry. I... I couldn't resist. - You! It, uh... feels like a latch. Look at this. All right, good. Let's go. Oh! Ben, look at this. Oh, that's beautiful! - Patrick. Patrick! - Ben, what is that? Appears to be a counterweight to hold the door open. What is that sound? Fascinating. Ah! Ben! Sorry. - You OK? - No. Get up. It's locked. - Patrick, what have you done? - Some kind of a bolt. I didn't do it. Only one way out of here now. Forward. Oh! Never seen so many relics. So beautifully preserved. Looks like we're going to be moving some rocks. - There's a tunnel back in through here. - Guys, look at this. It's a little golden man. Look. It's got a tiny little torso. Look at that. It looks like... - Ben! - Ben! Move back! Move back! All of you! Other side! Back up! Back up! Ah! Riley, move forward! Move forward! No, back up, back up. - What you want me to do? - Stop! Stop! We have to balance our weight to even this thing out. - We'll find 'em. - What are we gonna do? Figure something out. Tell you what we're going to do. - No, I'll tell you. - No. I'll tell you! No, I'll tell you! There's that passageway. You go, pull those stones out, because that leads somewhere. That is a good idea. There's nothing. Just a big old black hole. Ben, look! There's a ladder. - I mean, what's left of a ladder. - Toss me the light. Riley. Move slowly to that corner. No! Wait. Just... - As I move to this corner. - OK. One step at a time. Good. If we can raise this corner, I think I'll reach it. - Stop! Red light! - You're not helping! I can get up there just as easy as you. Just stop. - Guys! - It's three against one here. I ain't going last, and if I'm not going last, I might as well go first. Look! What's it gonna be? We'll do this your way. The rest of us, on my count of three, all move together. One step at a time. One, two, three. - You ready? - Go. Ah! Mitch, what do you see? Is there a way out? What's up there, Mitch? Em? - Are you all right? - Just promise me he's gonna be OK. All right. Let's go. Mitch! Come on! - I've been doing the math here, and... - I know. We're gonna have to leave one person behind. Promise you'll come back for me. I can do the math too. - That makes you next. - I'll go last. ""No, we'll figure something else out."" ""We need you there. Please, Riley."" I'm just kidding. Go. OK... - One... two... three! - Go! Oh! - What are you doing? - Nothing. Uh! I can't get it. Just go! Go now! Go! - All right, ready? - Now! Ah! Riley! Hang on! OK. Mitch, the idol. OK, Ben. We found a gold idol here! We can roll it over to offset your weight! Then roll it! Here it comes! Come on, Ben! Here! Give me your hand! Ben! Thanks, Riley. Why couldn't a girl see me do that? - You all right? - You're OK. You're OK. You're OK. So... forward. What is this? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Put your light over there. What are you doing? I can't see anything! Is this it? It's oil! It's a dead end! There's no way out! We have to turn back! OK. No. No, Patrick, this is crazy. OK. I got it! I got you! I got you! There's no forward! It's not forward, it's down! All this water has to go out somewhere. Otherwise, it'd be filled up. Help me turn this wheel! The water's going down. It is... Em. Em. Em. Ben! Hey! Dad! We found it! - Thomas was right! - No, you were right! Sorry I smeared your great-great granddaddy's good name. Seemed like the only way to get you in on the hunt. But this was a chance for the Wilkinson family to make its mark on history, to find the City of Gold, to be remembered. What happened to you? Your father was worried sick about you. She was frantic. She was frantic. Dad, coming through, did you happen to see? Stop it. Coming through, did you see any branches that could lead out? No, it's all blocked. You can't even get back to the big, round stone door. Where's your mother going? Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Have a look at this. - What? - Look. This is gonna unlock the Olmec language. It's gonna give us incredible insight into pre-Columbian history. Oh! Em? - You happy? - Oh, yeah. - Ben! Look at this! Look! - Oh, yeah. That's where they slit the throat, cut the heart out. - What was that? - Listen. Ah! I tried to find a way out. All those portals are blocked off! I'm telling you, all this water goes out somewhere. We'll find it. Ben, there's a current! Follow it! There's got to be a central drain! It's under us. Right here! Come on! Let's go! Get in there! The water's rising too fast! Let's get that door open so we don't all drown! Ben, it slopes down! It's a drainage tunnel. It fills with water when you open the door! We need to find something to stick under it to keep it open! No, if it's open, this tunnel will stay flooded. We've got to get to the other side and close the door. Patrick, Emily, go! - No. - No! No! Mitch, we got to be on the other side of that door! Nobody leaves unless I say so. That door is not gonna stay open by itself. We both know what has to happen here. One of us keeps the door open and stays behind. I vote Mitch. This isn't a democracy. Stop! I'll stay! I'm staying. Look. Look! See? I'm right here! I'm staying! I'll tell everybody how this is going to go. You and me are going to open that door. Anybody tries to leave before me, I drop the door, we start this all over again! Try any funny business, I guarantee you people are going to get hurt! I won't! You have my word. Just let her go. Ben, no, we're not leaving without you. Abigail. You make my parents leave. You make my parents leave. - No! - Let's go! Let's go, please! Patrick, Emily, he's trying to save our lives. Please, come on. Push, Ben! The current's too strong! - I'm ready! - It's all yours! Ah! Mom! Hang on! Hold your breath! Ah! We got to get Ben out of there! If I'm stuck in the door, it stays open, both rooms fill up, and we all drown! - Open the door! I'll get you out! - The current's too strong! I open the door, you'll be washed down! I'll get you out! I found the City of Gold! I found it! And no one will ever know? We can figure this out! We can all get out! It's not a puzzle! No more puzzles, Ben! We're all going to die, or it could just be me! - Tell them I found it! - Don't quit! Mitch! Ah! Thank you. - We haven't officially met. I'm Riley. - Oh, hi. Sir! It's for you. Sadusky. - I have my proof. - Ben! We were just talking about you. Ready to turn yourself in? Not quite. We found the City of Gold. Doesn't matter. You still committed a federal crime. Stop. Stop it. - Mr. President? - Craig, give us a minute. Sir, for your information, this is the man who kidnapped you. As I recall, we were exploring a hidden tunnel, and a door closed accidentally, and this man saved my life. Yes, sir. - Gates. - Sir. For the record, after centuries of exploration, on this day, you have brought honor to your country and your family. You've done this country a great service. I thank you. - Thank you. - Craig. I thought you might want to take a look at tomorrow's headlines. Tomorrow? Thank you, sir. All of you, along with Emily and Patrick Gates will get credit for this discovery. And Mitch Wilkinson, sir. - Is that right? - It's true, sir. Ben, I am curious about that favor I asked you. Any report regarding what's on page 47? I believe I can help with that, sir. - So it's good. - Life-altering, sir. What's on page 47? Are you talking about the Book? What book? Be very careful with that. Is that distilled water you're using? - Yes. - Have you catalogued all of this? - No, ma'am. - You haven't? Excuse me? Excuse me, sir? Are you cataloguing this? You should've been there when we picked out our first couch. Excuse me. Hey, you're that guy... The treasure hunter guy, right? No, actually, the guy you're thinking of is somewhere over there. No. You're him. Riley Poole. I recognize you from your book. Will you sign it? OK. Thank you. So, um, the tea tables... Yes, I'm going to have the movers bring them to you next week. I was going to say you can keep them. And maybe you could... ...come and move back in with me. - No. You used the word ""so."" - So? So, when you say ""so,"" it means you're angry. Sometimes. And then sometimes it doesn't. It's sort of like a puzzle. And you're so good at puzzles. I'm sure you'll figure it out. So... I love this car.

Harry Bright. Gentlemen, I have to go. Thank you very much. Take care. Morning, Rodney. Taxi! JFK, please, as quick as you can. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I missed you. Oh, no... - We're... - We're... Sophie, Ali, Lisa! We're the greatest, bestest mates! - I'm tough. - I'm tall. - I'm tiny. - And we're gonna rock this place. - Sophie, it's beautiful. - I want one. He did well, didn't he? I'm getting married tomorrow. I'm so glad you're here, because I have a secret and I can't tell anybody else. - Sophie, you're knocked up? - No! No! No! I've invited my dad to my wedding. You are joking! - You found him at last? - No! No, no, no, no, no, not exactly. Okay. You know what my mom always said when I asked about my father. It was a summer romance, and he'd gone long before she realised that she was expecting me. And I'd always kind of accepted that that's all I'd ever know. Well, I was ransacking some old trunks and I found this. It's the diary she kept the year she was pregnant with me. Sophie! ""July 17th. What a night!"" - I don't know if I want to hear this! - I do! ""Sam rowed me over to the little island."" That's here. That's Kalokairi. ""We danced on the beach, and we kissed on the beach, ""and dot, dot, dot."" What? ""Dot, dot, dot.""

""All this time, Sam's been telling me he loves me, ""and now he's announced that he's engaged, ""so he's gone home to get married, ""and I'm never going to see him again."" Poor Donna. ""August 4th. What a night! ""Bill rented a motorboat, and I took him over to the little island."" - Bill? Sophie, wait. - Hang on. ""Though I'm still obsessed with Sam, ""Bill's so wild. He's such a funny guy. ""One thing led to another, ""and dot, dot, dot."" ""August 11th. Harry turned up, out of the blue, ""so I said I'd show him the island. ""He's so sweet and understanding, I couldn't help it and - ""dot, dot, dot!"" - Dot, dot, dot! - Oh, my God! - Here come the bridesmaids. Donna! Look at you! God!

My sentiments exactly. So, who is your dad? - Sam, Bill or Harry? - I don't know. But which one did you invite? - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! - Do they know? - What would you write to a total stranger? ""Please come to my wedding, you might be my father""? No. They think that Mom sent the invites, and with what's in here, no surprise they said yes! Honey, honey How you thrill me Honey, honey Honey, honey Nearly kill me Honey, honey I'd heard about you before I wanted to know some more And now I'm about to see What you mean to me I'm trying to get to Kalokairi. When's the next ferry? - What? - Monday. - Bollocks! - Yeah, my sentiments exactly. Bride or groom? Bride, although I've actually never met her. Ahoy, there. You guys need a ride to Kalokairi? Excuse me, coming through. I have a senior citizen with me. Thank you. My mother needs a perch. Mother? We're the same age. Yeah. Well, parts of us are. Sailor. No. Oh, he has your book! Oh... Stavros, Stavros. Stavros. It's just a fish. You are so clever. We're going to look fabulous tomorrow. I want the perfect wedding, and I want my father to give me away. Better be a wide aisle. I will know my father as soon as I see him. Sky! Come here, gorgeous. Put me down. I'm getting married tomorrow. Please be careful. So? - There are pins in the dresses. What do you think? Oh, yes! ""Oh, yes."" If you had your way, it'd be a three-minute wedding in jeans and T-shirts, washed down with a bottle of beer. You make me sound so unromantic! I just thought we should save our money for travelling. Well, we're not going anywhere yet. Anyway, please leave. We're very, very busy. I'm just getting some props for tonight. Ooh! For his bachelor party. Why haven't you told him you've invited your dads? Because he would say that I'd have to tell my mom. Donna's absolutely gonna kill you when she finds out. By the time she finds out, it'll be too late. I feel like there's a part of me missing, and when I meet my dad, everything will fall into place. More open! - I'm on it. I'm on it. That's good. That's it. Come on, Cleopatra. My shoe! Will you look at what the tide washed in? - For one night. - And one night only. - Donna and the Dynamos! - Donna and the Dynamos! Look at you! - You baby! - Look at you! You look fantastic! You look like an old hippie! She looks fab. These are new, though. Where did you get these? Husband number three! - Dynamos! Dynamite! - Dynamos! Dynamite! Sleep all day and... All night! So, any men at this wedding? Gorgeous Greeks of independent means? Here we go! Husband number four! - No! Not for me, for her! - He's coming! For her, now that her book is a bestseller, and she's got the whole world stuffing, what, mushrooms? Various vegetables? It's time to find Mr Right! Oh, please. Boring! Great couple of role models you two are for Sophie! A serial bride and a little hermit over here! That's me! I'm a lone wolf! So, when are the lovebirds flying the nest? Oh, God! Who knows? You know, I do not know what is going on in that child's head sometimes. She wants a big white wedding, and she and Sky are making all kinds of plans for the hotel. Sometimes I think they'll never leave. Yeah, but do you really want her to? Well, I want what's best for her. Of course not! Sky! Come meet my backup girls. Backup girls, my ass! - Backup girls, my ass! He's the leading man at tomorrow's shindig. - The lucky man. - Hello. - You must be Rosie. - I am. - How are you? - Very well. And you must be Tanya. - I've heard so much about you. - All bad, I hope. - Yes. - And all true. Donna... Here, let me get them. I know who you are. You're Bill Anderson, aren't you? - Bloke in a Boat in Botswana. - Yes, I am. You know, your books are a godsend on dull business trips. Now, I may look like I'm pondering my securities, but in reality, I'm trekking across some remote corner of the planet. You should try it for real sometime. No, certainly, I'll never be the spontaneous adventurer. - You're a close friend of Donna's? - No, I haven't heard from her for 20 years. - Really? - And then this invite, out of the blue. You know, that's a coincidence, neither had I. - Going about! - You got it! Right. Wait... I've got it. Fine. Fine. You should have brought the iron lung. Why did I wear stilettos? - Oxygen. - Oh, my God! - Auntie Rosie! - Hey, hey! - Look at Sophie. She's gotten so beautiful! - I know. Come here to me. Sophie Sheridan, you get more gorgeous every time I see you. You do. - I bet you don't remember me. - Not with all that plastic surgery. Of course I do, Auntie Tanya. You haven't changed at all. - I'm so happy for you. - Look at my baby, her whole life ahead of her. Oh, please, I'm getting married. I'm not joining a convent! - She's feisty. I love that. - Yeah. She's a chip off the old block. If she were more like me, she wouldn't be getting married at 20. Or married at all. I meant to get the laundry down before you came. Tanya's going home! And you'd think with all this new technology, they would figure out a machine that would make the beds. And if they did, you'd be going along behind it, making them again. I know you, Mom. But I am good at modern... Tell them about the Internets. - He's gonna put me on the line. - Online. I'm designing a website. I just think this place has so much potential, and no one knows we're here. So, if I market it really, really well, then, hopefully, people will come flooding in. We just want this to be the ultimate romantic destination. This was once supposed to be the site of Aphrodite's fountain, you know, the goddess of love. And if you drank the water, you were supposed to find true love and perfect happiness. - I'll have a glass of that. - Yeah, I'll have a bucket. Aphrodite's spa? Well, I thought you didn't want boatloads of tourists. Oh, no, not boatloads, no. But, you know, a few more would be nice. Okay, now, the thing about the toilet, if it doesn't flush right away, just go and come back in a while, and it should... Nothing works around here, except for me. I've been running this hotel for 15 years, and I have never had a day off. Oh, my God! Sorry. I work all night I work all day To pay the bills I have to pay Ain't it sad? And still there never seems to be A single penny left for me Don't sit down there. That's too bad It's broken. In my dreams I have a plan If I got me a wealthy man I wouldn't have to work at all I'd fool around and have a ball Money, money, money Must be funny In a rich man's world Money, money, money Always sunny In a rich man's world All the things I could do If I had a little money It's a rich man's world It's a rich man's world A man like that is hard to find But I can't get him off my mind Ain't it sad? And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me That's too bad So I must leave I have to go To Las Vegas or Monaco And win a fortune in a game My life will never be the same Money, money, money Must be funny In a rich man's world Money, money, money Always sunny In a rich man's world All the things I could do If I had a little money It's a rich man's world Money, money, money Must be funny In a rich man's world Money, money, money Always sunny In a rich man's world All the things I could do If I had a little money It's a rich man's world It's a rich man's world What's going on? Do you feel it? The earth moved, darling. We're falling apart here. Don't think about it, come on. Let's go have fun. Tanya's packed for a world tour. Oh, Donna. Donna! Does she wear it or floss with it? Floss you. Is it edible, Tanya? Listen to this. ""The world's most luxurious moisturiser ""contains flakes of 24-carat gold ""and extracts of donkey testicle."" You're just jealous. At a thousand dollars a dollop. Tell you, that's the price you have to pay if you wanna drink before 11:00 in the morning. - And we do. - We do. Hi. May I help you? Sure, we're here for the wedding. - I'm Bill Anderson. - Huh? I'm Bright, Harry Bright. Sam Carmichael. You are expecting us? Oh, my God. Yes! You're not Donna's daughter? I thought you looked familiar. Sofia. - It's Sophie. - Well, Sofia is the Greek. Well, I'm named after a Sofia. I used to have a great-aunt living on the mainland named Sofia. Would you mind if we see our rooms before we see your mother? Sure. It's just that I'd quite like to freshen up before the big reunion. No! No! I mean, yes, but come this way. Come on! Oh, my God! I got a crack in my courtyard. I gotta go fix it. - Hey, listen, Donna? Donna. - I'm serious. Move. Sit down! - She won't let me go! - I know... I know you're going to make a fortune with web's... - ""With web's..."" - With Sky's site. I know you're gonna make a fortune with - Sky's website, but... - It's good. Are you gonna be okay until then? I think Tanya is offering to pawn her bling. - No, seriously, Donna... - Oh, my God. - Do you need a loan? - No, sweet. Oh, God, I'm just whining, you know me. I don't need to be taken care of. Yeah, but are you being taken care of? - What do you mean? - Are you getting any? Oh, you mean... Down, boy, down, boy. No, it takes too much energy. Yeah. Just more plumbing to be maintained, isn't it? Yeah. Oh, God, I'm so glad that whole part of my life is over. You know, seriously. I do not miss it at all. Then it's just right here. Good. Where's Donna? Hey! Okay. Up you go. Hmm. You know, I don't want to seem ungrateful for the scenic tour, but might I be shown my room now? Well, don't hold your breath, Harry, but I think this is your room. Can we see Donna now? I sent the invites. My mom doesn't know anything. Well, she's done so much for me, and she's always talking about you guys and the good old days, and I thought, what an amazing surprise for her that you are all gonna be at my wedding. Hang on, Sophie. I can't be here. The last time I saw your mother, she said she never wanted to see me again. That was years ago. Please, it would mean a lot to me. - Why? - Listen, I can see that you've been to a great deal of trouble. Might I suggest that we all reconvene on your boat? - Good idea. - Nope. - Why? - It's an adventure, Harry. - It's good for you. - Oh, I see. Okay, when I sent the invites, it was a long shot that you'd even reply. And now you've come all this way for a wedding. Surely there must have been some special reason for you to be here. Like some siren call, maybe? You're a little minx, you know that? You're just like your mother. I'm glad my boys haven't met you. They'd never recover. - You have sons? - Yes, two. And someday, I'd like to bring them here. Like you used to bring my mother? - No. - It's Donna. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, listen, she can't know. I'm going to go. Please stay. Promise me that you'll not tell anybody that I invited you. Okay? Promise? - You got it, baby. - It's a promise. - I might regret it, but okay. - Okay. There wouldn't, by any chance, happen to be a trouser press on the island, would there? Harry? Bill? I was cheated by you And I think you know when So I made up my mind It must come to an end Look at me now Will I ever learn? I don't know how But I suddenly lose control There's a fire within my soul Just one look and I can hear a bell ring One more look and I forget everything Mamma mia Here I go again My, my How can I resist you? Mamma mia Does it show again? My, my Just how much I've missed you Yes, I've been broken-hearted Blue since the day we parted Why, why did I ever let you go? Mamma mia Now I really know My, my I should not have let you go I was angry and sad When I knew we were through I can't count all the times I have cried over you Look at me now Will I ever learn? I don't know how But I suddenly lose control There's a fire within my soul Just one look and I can hear a bell ring One more look and I forget everything Mamma mia Here I go again My, my How can I resist you? Mamma mia Does it show again? My, my Just how much I've missed you Yes, I've been broken-hearted Blue since the day we parted Why, why did I ever let you go? Mamma mia Now I really know My, my I should not have let you go You always knew how to make an entrance. I'd better be dreaming. You'd better not be here. You want me to pinch you, Donna? No! You keep your hands to yourself, Bill Anderson. You probably don't recognise me, do you? Harry! It is you! I probably changed a bit, but you certainly haven't. Why are you here? What are you doing here? I'm writing a travel piece. I'm here on a spontaneous holiday. Okay. What is this? It's one of those serendipitous moments in life when three complete strangers share a common thought. Strangers? - You don't know each other? - That's generally the definition. Okay, good, but who... Why are you here? Who said that you could stay up in my old goat-house? - Didn't catch the name. - Greek lady. - Well, she spoke Greek. - Yeah. Or maybe she said we couldn't stay in the old goat-house. - Yeah, maybe that was it, in Greek. - There you go. Yeah, that's it, that's it. You can't stay here because I'm closed and I'm full. And I'm busy, I'm really... I have a wedding, my... Local girl's getting married... Donna. Donna, don't worry about us. Bill here is used to roughing it. - And Harry here... - I'm spontaneous. - Spontaneous. - Ah. What about you? Just wanted to see the island. You know what it meant to me. Okay, I'm gonna arrange for a boat to take you all back to the mainland. - I have a boat, Donna. - You have a boat? Good, get on it, and anchors away. - Hey, Donna... - Away, away. It's good to see you. Now, baby, this should tickle your taste buds. Down, big fella. I'm old enough to be your mother. Grandmother. Where's Sophie? - I think she went down to the beach. - What's up? Donna? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Talk to her. Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong Oh, me. I have never seen such sorrow In your eyes And the wedding is tomorrow How I hate to see you like this There is no way you can deny it I can see That you're oh, so sad So quiet I'm a shoulder you can cry on Your best friend I'm the one you must rely on You were always sure of yourself Now I see you've broken a feather I hope we can patch it up Together Chiquitita, you and I know How the heartaches come and they go And the scars, they're leaving You'll be dancing once again And the pain will end You will have no time for grieving Chiquitita, you and I cry But the sun is still in the sky And shining above you Let me hear you sing once more Like you did before Sing a new song, Chiquitita Try once more Like I did before Sing a new song - It's her dad. - Whose dad? Sophie's dad. Remember how I said it was Sam? Sam the architect, who had to go home to get married? I'm not sure that it was him, because there were two other guys around the same time. Donna Sheridan. You shady lady. Why didn't you tell us? Well, I never knew that I would ever, ever have to. I never imagined I'd see all three of them in my old goat-house the day before my daughter's wedding! - The old goat-house? - The old goat-house? No! No! Wait! Shoot! Rosie! Tanya! Wait a minute! Don't let them hear you! - There's no one here. - Are you sure? Of course I'm sure! Do you think I would forget my daughter's dads? They were all here. Sam Carmichael, Bill Anderson and Harry ""Head Banger."" Harry ""Head Banger."" They must've gone back to their boat. I hope they run aground and drown. What are they doing here? It's like some hideous trick of fate. It's very Greek. - Do they know about Sophie? - What are they, psychic? No! I've never told a soul. Oh, Donna, keeping it to yourself all these years. It doesn't matter about me. The only thing that matters is that Sophie never finds out. Well, maybe she would be cool with it. ""Cool with it""? You don't know my daughter. This would be like a bombshell. Donna, they've gone! I don't know that. I don't know where they are. I don't know why they're here. And I have brought this all on myself because I was a stupid, reckless little slut! Whoa! Don't you sound like your mother? - I do not! - Yes, you so do! - Oh, my God, I do not. - You do, it's Catholic guilt! You've been living like a nun. Yeah, whatever happened to our Donna? Life and soul of the party, - el rock chick supremo? - Yeah, come on. - I grew up. - Well, then, grow back down again. - Screw them if they can't take a joke. - Screw them if they can't take a joke.

Wait! - Hey, don't leave. - Whoa, Sophie. - Sophie! We're gonna sail around the island. You wanna come? You promised you'd come to my wedding. Yes, well, your mother ejected us from the goat-house. She thought we'd better get out of her hair. Donna freaked out when she saw us. - What's all that about? - No. She's just not even thinking straight. She's so stressed about the wedding. You know, but she's got no idea that you're her lovely surprise. - She'll be so happy tomorrow. - You think so? Mmm-hmm. - You took Mom's guitar! - No, no. I borrowed it. Look. No, where is it? D.S. Donna Sheridan. And H.B. Head Banger. - Head Banger? - Head Banger? I bought her this. It cost me ten quid plus my Johnny Rotten T-shirt. Your mother knew quite a rebel. I was studying in Paris when I met her. I hopped on a train and followed her to Greece, quite spontaneously. I can still recall Our last summer I still see it all Walks along the Seine Laughing in the rain Our last summer Memories that remain We made our way along the river And we sat down in the grass By the Eiffel Tower I was so happy we had met It was the age of no regret Oh, yes Those crazy years, that was the time Of the flower power But underneath we had a fear of flying Of growing old A fear of slowly dying We took a chance Like we were dancing our last dance I can still recall Our last summer I still see it all In the tourist jam round the Notre Dame Our last summer Walking hand in hand Paris restaurants Our last summer Morning croissants Living for the day Worries far away Our last summer We could laugh and play And now you're working in a bank A family man, a football fan And your name is Harry How dull it seems Are you the hero of my dreams? Sophie! - Sophie! - Please, I have to go, - but please come tomorrow, okay? - Absolutely. - We'll be there. - It's a promise. Walks along the Seine Laughing in the rain Our last summer Memories that remain Sky! Where've you been? People have been arriving all afternoon. No one's seen you. I'm sorry, I was around the island, I just... I just lost track of time. - Where're you going? - It's my stag do. My last night of freedom. Which is how some people might see it, but for me, it's the last night before the greatest adventure of my life. You know how I said I wanted to find my father? Soph, we've been over this a million times. You don't need a father, you have a family. And you'll never leave me, right? Are you kidding? You have turned my world upside down. I wasn't jealous before we met Now every man that I see is a potential threat And I'm possessive It isn't nice You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice But now it isn't true Now everything is new And all I've learned has overturned I beg of you Don't go wasting your emotion Lay all your love on me It was like shooting a sitting duck A little small talk, a smile and, baby, I was stuck I still don't know what you've done with me A grown-up woman should never fall so easily I feel a kind of fear When I don't have you near Unsatisfied, I skip my pride I beg you, dear Don't go wasting your emotion Lay all your love on me Don't go sharing your devotion Lay all your love on me Don't go wasting your emotion Lay all your love on me Don't go sharing your devotion Lay all your love on me Ladies and no gentlemen, presenting, for one night and one night only... Because that's all we've got breath for. Speak for yourself, you old bat! The world's first girl power band, Donna and the Dynamos. Super Trouper Lights are gonna find me But I won't feel blue Like I always do 'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you I was sick and tired of everything When I called you last night from Glasgow All I do is eat and sleep and sing Wishing every show was the last show Wishing every show was the last show So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming Suddenly I feel all right And suddenly it's gonna be And it's gonna be so different when I'm on the stage tonight Tonight the Super Trouper Lights are gonna find me - Our song. - Your song? It's my song. Smiling, having fun Feeling like a number one Tonight the Super Trouper Beams are gonna blind me But I won't feel blue Like I always do 'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you So I'll be there when you arrive The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive And when you take me in your arms And hold me tight I know it's gonna mean so much tonight Tonight the Super Trouper Lights are gonna find me Shining like the sun Look, look, look, look, look. Smiling, having fun Feeling like a number one Tonight the Super Trouper Beams are gonna blind me But I won't feel blue Like I always do 'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you Super Trouper lights Are gonna find me I can't believe you! Excuse me! Hello. This is a hen party. Women only! - Thank you. - Okay. Why are they here, then, if it's not to ruin Sophie's wedding? But I thought you weren't so keen on this wedding. I don't want them spoiling it. They have no right to turn up like this. What have they ever done for their daughter? Donna, Donna, they didn't know she existed. Well, they didn't need to know, did they? I've done a great job with Soph, all by myself, and I won't be muscled out by an ejaculation! Is there a man out there? Someone to hear my prayer? Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! A man after midnight Won't somebody help me Chase the shadows away Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! A man after midnight - Hi. - Hi. I think I should explain to Donna that I come in peace. Oh, no, really. You should wait until she has a few drinks in her first. - Really. - Good idea. Good idea. What you drew on the boat... This is good. This is really good. Why don't you pursue this? You have a real talent here. I have enough to do here. Is that really your dream? Running the villa with Donna? She just can't do it by herself. Do you know, I drew this whole place up on the back of a menu one night. I always dreamt I'd come back here. What kept you? What's your mother said about me? - She never mentioned you. - Sophie? What am I doing here? Some air in here. Somebody up there has got it in for me. I bet it's my mother. Oh, and wasn't she a ray of sunshine. I'm gonna go get them out of here. You go in there guns loaded, there's gonna be questions. - Help me out of these boots. - Come on, then. All that fricking yoga's made my feet bigger. Now, listen. Listen, what we're gonna do is, we'll get them plastered tonight, and then tomorrow, Tanya and I will take them fishing. Fishing? Oh, please. What do you suggest we do with three men? Well, then, now, that takes me back. Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! A man after midnight Take me through the darkness To the break of the day - Hello. - You okay? I'm fine. Fancy Donna having a grown-up daughter! - Do you have any children, Harry? - Well, I have the dogs, Lucy and Kipper. That's the extent of my relationships. I'd have loved a daughter. I'd have spoiled her rotten. - Is your father here? - I don't know. I don't know who my father is. Is there a man out there? Someone to hear my prayer? This is fantastic! How on earth did Donna get money to buy this place? She was left some money by the old lady she looked after when I was little. - Sofia, that I'm named after. - My great-aunt Sofia? I guess. I always heard her money was left to family. - How old are you? - I'm 20. Will you excuse me a minute? I'm sorry. Bill! Bill, wait. Why did your great-aunt leave my mother money? I don't know! All my life, there's been this huge unanswered question, and I don't want any more secrecy! What do you want from me? - Bill, please! Are you my father? Yes. I think so. Yes. You know what comes next? Oh, you're not going to tell me that you have a twin sister, are you? Will you give me away tomorrow? - Give you away? - No! Our secret until the wedding. Cute. Oh, God. Okay. People everywhere A sense of expectation hanging in the air Giving out a spark Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark And here we go again We know the start, we know the end Masters of the scene We've done it all before And now we're back to get some more You know what I mean Voulez-vous Take it now or leave it Now is all we get Nothing promised, no regrets Voulez-vous Ain't no big decision You know what to do La question c'est voulez-vous Voulez-vous Go dance with Mom! Sophie, come here. I know why I'm here. Why didn't Donna tell me? How long have you known I'm your father? What? Not long at all. Sam, listen to me. My mom doesn't know that I know. So can we wait until after my wedding? - Who's giving you away tomorrow? - Nobody. Wrong. I am. Our secret till then. Voulez-vous Take it now or leave it Now is all we get Are you okay? I can't breathe. Voulez-vous Ain't no big decision You know what to do La question c'est voulez-vous Voulez-vous Oh, my God! - I'm your father! - Harry! Now, that's why you sent me the invite. You wanted your old dad to walk you down the aisle. Well, I won't let you down. I'll be there.

Fancy Donna having a... I'm your... Who's giving you... Sophie! - Soph! Stand back, everybody. - Give her some space. Soph... - Baby! Come on, Mother, rise and shine. I was tossing and turning all night. Those three guys are still loose on this island. We got to do something. Donna! Donna! Donna! Donna. It's all under control. I have been tossing and turning all night. I've got three dads coming to my wedding, and I have to tell two of them they're surplus. Only, which two? It's all under control. I'm taking Bill and Sam fishing... We're each gonna go off. We're gonna grab a man, interrogate him, swap notes and decide. And Harry's talked Tanya into water sports. Oh, God. Nurse, donkey testicles, quickly! - No, after you. Please. - No. No. Go ahead. No, no, no, no, you first. - I want to get something off my chest. - Me, too. Last night, I discovered something wonderful. It was a wake-up call, a way to look at myself and what I really want out of life. Last night? You didn't know? You didn't even suspect that you were... Well, no. Of course not. That's always been a secret. And now we... Say it out loud. No! No! No! It's absolutely hush-hush. I mean, for now. All will be revealed tonight. Talking of revelations, last night... You and the little lady? I think I know what's going on. - No, you don't. You don't. - It's obvious. I saw it from the moment you clapped eyes on each other. You're kidding. I'm gonna level with you, Harry. I don't think I can do this. Well, she's a wonderful girl, but can I take her on in my life? Bill, where's your spontaneity? It's this... - This family, you know? - You don't have to marry her. What? Hey, right in time for breakfast. We're serving up the works here. - Think you just did. - Sunny-side up! Lox or ham? I'll just... I'm just gonna... What a mess! - Hey! - What? - You okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. - Sophie. - What? Last night, you and Sky... What's wrong? Tell me. Tell me what's wrong. - I don't know what to do. - You know what to do. You don't have to do anything. Not too late, I can still call off the wedding. Everybody will understand. Call... Call off the wedding? - Isn't that what you want? - No. No. No, that's what you want. - No! - Yes! God! Sophie! You just... You have no idea. You never had a wedding. You never did the marriage-and-babies thing. You just did the baby thing. - Well, good for you. - You know, I don't know why - you're going off on me now! I really don't! - Because I... - God! I love Sky, and I want to be with him! - Good! Great. And I don't want my children growing up not knowing who their father is. Because it's just... It's crap! Voulez-vous - What are you doing? - Stop, you're terrible. Come on, man. What are you talking about? Okay, okay, Sophie's gonna have an absolutely beautiful wedding, right? You're supposed to be helping me. You guys... He's got to get ready. I see you kept my bagpipes. They're supposed to ward off unwanted visitors. Well, you don't need bagpipes to do that. What are you doing here, Sam? This is our dream, remember? - Villa on the island? - Yeah. Well, this is my reality. Hard work and a crippling mortgage. Shoot! And a hotel that's crumbling around me. - Look, I'll help... Let me have a look at this... - No, that's all right, I can deal my own disasters. Why didn't you tell me it was Sophie getting married? Well, I didn't think it was any of your business. Why is she getting married? Settling down on the island? I mean, if it was up to me, I'd be telling her to go get a life. - Yeah. - She's a bright kid. I know. I know. But, you know, my daughter has a mind of her own. Oh, yeah. I see that. I see that. - But she's so young. - I know. I mean, does she know what she really wants? You see, I think part of her just wants to let you know that she isn't going to leave you alone here, on your own. - What do you mean? - Donna, look. I have two grown children. I know something about letting go. If Sophie felt you were okay on your own, would she want something different for herself? Okay, here's the thing. I love being on my own. I really do. You know, every morning, I get up and I thank God that I don't have some middle-aged, menopausal man telling me how to run my life. You know, I'm free and I'm single. And it's great. Where are those happy days? They seem so hard to find I try to reach for you But you have closed your mind What ever happened to our love? I wish I understood It used to be so nice It used to be so good So when you're near me, darling Can't you hear me? SOS The love you gave me Nothing else can save me SOS When you're gone How can I even try to go on? When you're gone, though I try How can I carry on? You seem so far away though you are standing near You made me feel alive but something died, I fear I really tried to make it out I wish I understood What happened to our love? It used to be so good So when you're near me, darling Can't you hear me? SOS And the love you gave me Nothing else can save me SOS - When you're gone - When you're gone - How can I even try to go on? - How can I even try to go on? - When you're gone - When you're gone - Though I try how can I carry on? - Though I try how can I carry on? Donna must be tearing her hair out, doing this wedding on her own. What would the father of the bride normally do? Pay. Though my dad drew the line at my third. I see. Excuse me. Harry? Harry! Tanya! Let's pick up where we left off last night. Last night never happened. I've drawn a veil over last night. Oh, my God. Look at the time. I've got work to do. - Work? - A little repair and renovation. Come on. You don't mess with a masterpiece. Oh, ignore him, Tanya, he's all mouth and no trousers. Tanya can't ignore the chemistry between us. Little boys who play with fire get their fingers burned. You're so hot, teasing me So you're blue Well, I can't take a chance on a kid like you It's something I couldn't do There's that look in your eyes I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild Oh, but, boy, you're only a child Well, I can dance with you, honey If you think it's funny But does your mother know that you're out? And I can chat with you, baby Flirt a little, maybe Does your mother know that you're out? - Take it easy - Take it easy. Better slow down, boy That's no way to go Does your mother know? - Take it easy - Take it easy. Try to cool it, boy Play it nice and slow Does your mother know? Come on, boy. I can see what you want But you seem pretty young To be searching for that kind of fun So maybe I'm not the one Now you're so cute I like your style And I know what you mean When you give me a flash of that smile But, boy, you're only a child Well, I can dance with you, honey If you think it's funny Does your mother know that you're out? And I can chat with you, baby Flirt a little, maybe Does your mother know that you're out? Well, I can dance with you, honey If you think it's funny Does your mother know that you're out? And I can chat with you, baby Flirt a little, maybe Does your mother know that you're out? Does your mother know that you're out? Does your mother know that you're out? Does your mother know? Does your mother know that you're out? Boy down! Boy down! Yo, girls. We done good. Yes, any colour. Doesn't matter. There's no plan, God knows there's no plan. - It looks great, though. - Ella, Donna, where would you like this? Carlos, get the meat out of the heat. Put a cover on that thing. That's beautiful. And tell... lone, help him get the... - Harry, what are you doing here? - Hello. I just wanted to give you this. I don't mean here, here. - I mean, why are you on this island? - I realised... What is this? Now, I realised you'll have had to tighten your belt a bit over the years, bringing up Sophie on your own, and I just wanted to make a small contribution to the wedding. - I can't accept this. I can't... - No. No. - Harry, I can't. - No. No. - Harry? I can't... - No, you'll have to catch me first. - Sky. - What's the matter? - You have to help me. - Why, what's happened? Baby? Sophie! Soph. I've done something completely insane. All my dads are here for our wedding, and they all think they're giving me away. All your what? I read Mom's diary, and I have three possible fathers. But how are they here now? I invited them. I thought that I would know my dad right away, but I didn't. I just... I have no idea. And now, my mom is gonna kill me, - and they're gonna hate me, and you... - Hold on. Hold on. You invited these guys and you didn't tell me? No, I thought you would try to stop me. - I know I messed up. - Sophie? Is that what this whole big white wedding is about? - You finding your dad? - No. No! I wanted to take a boat to the mainland with a couple of witnesses. And you insisted on this sodding circus so you could play Happy Families. It's about knowing who I am. And I wanted to get married knowing who I am. That doesn't come from finding your father, that comes from finding yourself. And the irony is, I was travelling to find myself. I put everything on hold for you. Because I loved you and I wanted what you wanted. Now, I don't know. You don't know if you love me? Of course I love you. I just wish you'd told me. Is everything okay? - Sophie, what's wrong? - Not now, Sam. Yes, yes, yes, now. Because I'm supposed to be giving you away. And how can I when I know you're not really gonna be happy? I've heard all this from my mother, and I think she knows me better than you do. I know. But I've done the big white wedding, and believe me, - it doesn't always end in ""happy ever after."" - That is you. That's not me. Okay? I love Sky more than anything in the world. And I... Did you feel that way before you got married? No. Hey, aren't you supposed to be getting dressed? Where's Ali and Lisa? I thought they were going to help you. Will you help me? Mmm-hmm. Wait. It's okay, it's okay. We have time. Schoolbag in hand She leaves home in the early morning Waving goodbye With an absent-minded smile I watch her go With a surge of that well-known sadness And I have to sit down for a while The feeling that I'm losing her Forever And without really entering her world I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter That funny little girl Slipping through my fingers all the time I try to capture every minute The feeling in it Slipping through my fingers all the time Do I really see what's in her mind? Each time I think I'm close to knowing She keeps on growing Slipping through my fingers all the time Sleep in our eyes Her and me at the breakfast table Barely awake I let precious time go by Then when she's gone There's that odd melancholy feeling And a sense of guilt I can't deny What happened to those wonderful adventures The places I had planned for us to go Slipping through my fingers all the time Well, some of that we did But most we didn't And why, I just don't know Slipping through my fingers all the time I try to capture every minute The feeling in it Slipping through my fingers all the time Do I really see what's in her mind? Each time I think I'm close to knowing She keeps on growing Slipping through my fingers all the time Do you think I'm letting you down? Why would you even think that? Well, because of what you've done. I mean, the Dynamos, raising a kid, and running a business all on your own. Well, honey, I didn't have a choice. I couldn't go home, you know. When I got pregnant, my mother told me not to bother coming back. And I wouldn't have had it any other way. My God, look at what we've had. Will you give me away? Yeah. Sometimes I wish That I could freeze the picture And save it from the funny tricks of time Slipping through my fingers Schoolbag in hand She leaves home in the early morning Waving goodbye With an absent-minded smile Donna! Donna. I need to talk to you about who's giving Sophie away. - That would be me. - But... - What about her dad? - Her dad isn't here. It's what she wants. She told me she wants her father here. - What if her father wants that, too? - What? Sam, don't do this now. I can't hear this now! Donna, listen to me. This is about us. I don't wanna talk About things we've gone through Though it's hurting me Now it's history I've played all my cards And that's what you've done, too Nothing more to say No more ace to play The winner takes it all The loser standing small Beside the victory That's her destiny I was in your arms Thinking I belonged there I figured it made sense Building me a fence Building me a home Thinking I'd be strong there But I was a fool Playing by the rules The gods may throw the dice Their minds as cold as ice And someone way down here Loses someone dear The winner takes it all The loser has to fall It's simple and it's plain Why should I complain? But tell me does she kiss Like I used to kiss you? Does it feel the same When she calls your name? Somewhere deep inside You must know I miss you But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed The judges will decide The likes of me abide Spectators at the show Always staying low The game is on again A lover or a friend A big thing or a small The winner takes it all I don't wanna talk 'Cause it makes me feel sad And I understand You've come to shake my hand I apologise If it makes you feel bad Seeing me so tense No self-confidence, but you see The winner takes it all The winner takes it all The game is on again A lover or a friend A big thing or a small The winner takes it all So the winner takes it all And the loser has to fall So the winner takes it all And the loser has to fall Donna! The winner takes it All Donna, there you are. - It's okay. - They're my best shoes. Panic over! Here she is. - She's here. - Oh, don't worry. - Oh, God. I love you. Welcome to Sophie and Sky, and to all your friends who have gathered together this evening. And welcome, especially, to Donna, who represents your family. We are all here together in this - glorious... - And welcome to... To Sophie's dad. - I have to tell you. He is here. - I know. I invited him. You couldn't have. I don't know which one it is. Oh, my God. - That's why they're all here! - I'm sorry. Sorry. I just... Please, please forgive me! Please forgive me. Please. I don't know. - Can you forgive me? - What? I don't care if you slept with hundreds of men. You're my mom, and I love you so much. Oh, Soph. And I haven't slept with hundreds of men. Am I getting this right? Sophie may be mine, but she may be Bill's or Harry's? Yeah, yeah. That's right. And don't get all self-righteous with me, because you have no one but yourself to blame. Yeah, if you hadn't just dumped my mother and gone off and married somebody else... Hey, hey, wait a minute! I had to go home. I was engaged. But I told Lorraine I couldn't marry her, and I came right back. You... You... - Why didn't you call me? - Because I was crazy enough to think that you would be waiting for me. Only when I arrived, they told me you were off with some other guy. So, Lorraine called me an idiot and married me to prove it. Sorry, can I just... Might I just butt in? Oh, Harry, don't... It's all right. You don't have to. No, no, I just wanted to say it's great to have even a third of Sophie. I never thought I'd get even that much of a child. Donna, you were the first girl I ever loved. Well, actually, you were the last girl I ever loved. Now, this gives me an excuse to come here much more often. We can find out if you want, but I'm with Harry. - Being a third of your dad is great by me. - By me, too. I'll take a third. Typical, isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad, and then three come along at once. Dearly beloved... You know, I have no clue which one of you is my dad, but I don't mind. Now, I know what I really want. Sky, let's just not get married yet. - What? - What? You never wanted this anyway. I know that. Let's just get off this island and just see the world. Okay? All right? I love you. Donna, do I take it the wedding is cancelled? I'm not entirely sure what's happening right now. Hang on. Why waste a good wedding? How about it, Sheridan? You're going to need someone to boss around on this island of yours. Are you nuts? I am not a bigamist. Neither am I. I'm a divorced man who's loved you for 21 years, and ever since the day I set foot on this island, I've been trying to tell you how much I love you. Come on, Donna. It's only the rest of your life. I can't conceal it Don't you see? Can't you feel it? Say I do Oh, yeah. I do, I do, I do, I do, I do Donna, please show it You love me And you know it Say I do I do I do, I do, I do, I do. I now pronounce you man and wife. I'm so happy! Here's to us One more toast And then we'll pay the bill Deep inside both of us Could feel the autumn chill Birds of passage You and me We fly instinctively When the summer's over And the dark clouds hide the sun Neither you nor I'm to blame When all is said and done In our lives We have walked Some strange and lonely treks Yeah. Slightly worn but dignified And not too old for sex Yeah!

Several functions require your attendance, sir. Great! Let's get started. Oome on, lazybones. Time to get moving! You need to get a pair ofjammies. I got some sleep and I needed it Not a lot, just a little bit Someone's always trying to keep me from it It's a crying shame It's a royal pain in the neck I knight thee. If you're filling in for a king, you should look like one. Oan somebody come in and work on Shrek? I will see what I can do. Yeah, wow. Is this really necessary? Quite necessary, Fiona. - I'm Shrek, you twit. - Whatever. This isn't a rehearsal, peoples. Let's see some hustle! Smiles, everyone! Smiles! I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I'm sorry, but can you just try to grin and bear it? It's just until Dad gets better. Shrek? You look handsome. Oome here, you. My butt is itching up a storm and I can't reach it in this monkey suit.

Who do you think we're kidding? I am an ogre. I'm not cut out for this, Fiona, and I never will be. I think that went well. Donkey! Oome on, Shrek! Some people just don't understand boundaries. Just think. A couple more days and we'll be back home... ...in our vermin-filled shack strewn with fungus... ...and filled with the stench of mud and neglect. You had me at ""vermin-filled"" . And, um... maybe even the pitter-patter of little feet on the floor. That's right, the swamp rats will be spawning. Uh, no. What I'm thinking of is a little bigger than a swamp rat. Donkey? No, Shrek. What if, theoretically... ...they were little ogre feet? Honey, let's be rational about this. Have you seen a baby lately? They just eat and poop, and they cry... ...then they cry when they poop and poop when they cry. Now, imagine an ogre baby. They extra-cry and they extra-poop. Shrek, don't you ever think about having a family? Right now, you're my family. Somebody better be dying. I'm dying. Harold? Don't forget to pay the gardener, Lillian. Of course, darling. Fiona. Yes, Daddy? I know I made many mistakes with you. It's okay. But your love for Shrek has... ...taught me much. My dear boy... ...I am proud to call you my son.

Yeah, Dad? This kingdom needs a new king. You and Fiona are next in line for the throne. Next in line. You see, Dad, that's why people love you. Even on your deathbed, you're still making jokes. Oome on, Dad. An ogre as king? That's not such a good idea. There must be somebody else. Anybody! Aside from you, there is only one remaining heir. Really? Who is he, Dad? His name is... ...is... What's his name? ...is... Daddy! His name is Arthur. Arthur? I know you'll do... ...what's right. Harold? Dad? Dad! Dad? Do your thing, man.

Just a chance at redemption. And a Fuzzy Navel. And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends! We're not your friends. You don't belong here. You're absolutely right, but, I mean, do any of us? Do a number on his face. Wait, wait, wait! We are more alike than you think. Wicked Witch! The Seven Dwarfs saved Snow White, and what happened? Oh, what's it to you?

Oinderella is in Far Far Away right now... ...eating bonbons, cavorting with every last fairy tale creature... ...that has ever done you wrong! Once upon a time, someone decided that we were the losers. But there are two sides to every story... ...and our side has not been told! So who will join me? Who wants to come out on top for once?

As are you. And, uh, you. I don't know you, but I'd like to. I got to go! I don't wanna leave you either. But you know how Shrek is. The dude's lost without me. But don't worry. I'll send you airmail kisses every day! Be strong, babies. Ooco, Peanut, listen to your mama. Bananas, no roasting marshmallows on your sister's head. That's my special boy! Oome here, all of you! Give your daddy a big hug! Shrek? Maybe you should just stay and be King. Oome on. There's no way I could run a kingdom. That's why your cousin Arthur is a perfect choice. It's not that. You see... And if he gives me trouble, I always have persuasion and reason. Here's persuasion... and here's reason. Fiona... ...soon it's just going to be you, me... ...and our swamp.

Donkey. Donkey! Wake up! Dada! Shrek! Are you okay? I can't believe I'm going to be a father. How did this happen? Allow me to explain. When a man has feelings for a woman... ...a powerful urge sweeps over him. I know how it happened. I just can't believe it. How does it happen? And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon When you coming home, son? I don't know when But we'll get together then, Dad. Donkey! Oan you just cut to the part where you're supposed to make me feel better? You know I love Fiona, boss. Right? What I am talking about is you, me, my cousin's boat... ...an ice cold pitcher of mojitos and two weeks of nothing but fishing. Don't listen to him! Having a baby isn't going to ruin your life. It's not my life I'm worried about ruining, it's the kid's . When have you ever heard the phrase ""as sweet as an ogre"" ... ...or "" as nurturing as an ogre"" ... ...or ""You'll love my dad. He's a real ogre."" Okay. I get it. It's not going to be easy. But you got us to help you. That's true. I'm doomed. You'll be fine. You're finished. Uh, with yourjourney. ""Wor-ces-ters-shiree"" ? Now that sounds fancy! It's Worcestershire. Like the sauce? It's spicy! They must be expecting us. What in the shista-shire kind of place is this? Well, my stomach aches and my palms just got sweaty. Must be a high school. High school? Ready? Okay! Wherefore art thou headed, to the top? Yeah, we think so, we think so! And dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped? Nay, we thinkst not, we thinkst not! All right, Mr. Percival, ease up on the reins. For lo, bro, don't burn all my frankincense and myrrh. I'm feeling nauseous from memories of wedgies and swirlies! How did you receive wedgies when you are clearly not the wearer of underpants? Let's just say some things are better left unsaid. So I was all like, "" I'd rather get the black plague than go out with you."" - Oh, totally. - Pardon me. - Totally ew-eth. - Yeah, totally. I just altered my character level to +3 superb-ability. Hi. We're looking for someone named... Who rolled a +9 dork spell and summoned the beast and his quadruped? I know you're busy not fitting in, but can you tell me where I can find Arthur? He's over there. There is no sweeter taste on thy tongue than victory! Strong, handsome, face of a leader. Does Arthur look like a king or what? Sorry. Did you say you were looking for Arthur? That information is on a need-to-know basis. It's top secret! Now, gentlemen, let's away. To the showers! Greetings, Your Majesty. This is your lucky day. What are you supposed to be? Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun or something? Giant mutant... You made a funny. Unhand me, monster! Stop squirming, Arthur. I'm not Arthur. I am Lancelot. That dork over there is Arthur. This is, like, totally embarrassing... ...but Tiffany thinkest thou vex her so soothly. She thought perchance thou would ask her to the Homecoming Dance. Excuse me? Like, whatever. She's into college guys and mythical creatures. Oh, Arthur... ...come out, come out, wherever you are! You better run, you little punk no-goodniks! The days of Donkey Dumpy Drawers are over! Hold it. We're here for the mascot contest. We're here for the mascot contest, too. This is a costume? Worked on it all night long. Looks pretty real to me. If he were real, could I do this? Or this? If it were real, that would have been agonizingly painful. - Now watch this! - That's quite enough, boys. Thank you to Professor Primbottom and his lecture... ...on ""just say nay"" . And now, without further ado, let's give a warm Worcestershire hoozah... ...to the winner of our mascot contest, the... ...ogre? That's right. I'm the new mascot. So let's really try and beat the other guys at... ...whatever it is they're doing! This is all a bit unorthodox... Where can I find Arthur Pendragon? Hey, wait... Olassic. You should be ashamed of yourself! I didn't do it. They did. Please don't eat me. Eat him! Eat him! Eat him! I'm not here to eat him! Time to pack up your toothbrush and jammies. You're the new King of Far Far Away. What? Artie a king? More like the Mayor of Loserville! Burn. Is this for real? Absolutely. Olean out your locker, kid. You have a kingdom to run. So, wait...l'm really the only heir? The one and only. Give me a second. My good people... ...there's a lesson here for all of us. Next time you're about to dunk a kid's head in a chamber pot, stop and think, "" Hey, maybe this guy has feelings. Maybe I should cut him some slack. 'Cause maybe... just maybe... ...this guy's gonna turn out to be, I don't know, a king? Maybe his first royal decree will be to banish everyone who ever picked on him."" I'm looking at you, jousting team! And Guin? Oh, Guin. I've always loved you. Good friends, it breaks my heart, but... ...enjoy your stay here in prison while I rule the free world! Okay, let's not overdo it. I'm building my city, people... on rock 'n ' roll! You just overdid it. Look at you! You look darling. Just precious. Look at her. Any cravings since you got pregnant? No. Not at all. Do you smell ham? It's present time! Fiona, please open mine first. It's the one in front. "" Oongratulations on your new mess mak..."" Oh, mess maker! "" Hopefully this helps. Love, Oinderella."" - Look at that! - What is it? It's for the poopies. Wait... babies poop? Everyone poops, Beauty. Fiona! We all chipped in for a little present, too. Ta-da! You know the baby will love it, because I do! Guys, that's so sweet. Thank you. Who's this one from? I got you the biggest one, because I love you most. "" Have one on me. Love, Snow White."" What is it? He's a live-in babysitter. Where's the baby? You're too kind, Snow, but I can't accept this. It's nothing. I have six more at home. - What does he do? - Oleaning. - Feeding. - Burping. So, what are Shrek and I supposed to do? Work on your marriage. Thanks, Rapunzel. What's that supposed to mean? Oome on now, Fiona. You know what happens. You're tired all the time. You start letting yourself go. Stretch marks. Say goodbye to romance. I'm sorry, but how many of you have kids? She's right! A baby will only strengthen the love Shrek and Fiona have. How did Shrek react when you told him? When he first found out, Shrek said... Onward, my new friends! To our happily ever afters! Now... bombs away! Well, well, well. If it isn't Peter Pan. - His name's not Peter. - Shut it, Wendy. Enough pillaging! To the castle! You go! Take care of the baby! Everybody stay calm! We're going to die! Everyone in! Now! Oome on! Put some back into it! We don't have time. Now go! Quickly, ladies! We'll hold them off as long as we can! Where are Shrek and Fiona? The name doesn't ring a bell. No bell. I suggest you freaks cooperate... ...with the new King of Far Far Away! The only thing you're ever gonna be king of is King of the Stupids! - Hook! - Right! Avast, ye cookie. Start talking. - Gingy! - Papa! Settle down now. On the good ship Lollipop It's a sweet trip to the candy shop You! You can't lie. So tell me, puppet... where is Shrek? Well... I don't know where he's not. You don't know where Shrek is? It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume... ...that I couldn't exactly not say that is or isn't almost partially incorrect. So you do know where he is! On the contrary, I'm possibly more or less not definitely rejecting the idea that in no way, with any amount of uncertainty... Stop it! ...I do not know where he shouldn't be. If that indeed wasn't where he isn't . Even if he wasn't not where I knew he was, it could mean... On the good ship Lollipop Enough! Shrek went off to bring back the next heir! He's bringing back the next heir? No! Hook! Get rid of this new "" King"" . But bring Shrek to me. I have something special in mind for him. He'll never fall for your tricks! Oh, boy. I can't believe it. Me, a king? I knew I came from royalty, but... ...I figured everyone forgot about me. Oh, no. In fact the King asked for you personally. Really? Wow. But I know it's not all fun and games. It really is all fun and games, actually. Sure, you have to knight a few heroes, launch a ship or two. By the way, make sure you hit the boat just right with the bottle. Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle. Well, I've heard it's harder than it looks. This is going to be huge. Parties, princesses, castles. Princesses. You'll be living in the lap of luxury. The finest chefs will wait for your order. And fortunately, you'll have the royal food tasters. What do they do? Taste the food before the King eats, to make sure it's not poisoned. - Poisoned? - Or too salty. Don't worry. Your bodyguards will keep you safe. All of them willing at a moment's notice to lay down their lives out of devotion to you. Really? The whole kingdom will look to you for wisdom and guidance. Make sure they don't die of famine! - Or plague. - Plague is bad. The coughing, the groaning, the festering sores. Festering sores! You are one funny kitty cat. What did I say? We don't want Artie getting the wrong idea. Artie? There goes my hip! Artie! What are you doing? What does it look like?! This really isn't up to you. I don't know anything about being king! You'll learn on the job! Sorry, but I'm going back. Back to what? Being a loser? Now look what you did! Look what I did? Who's holding the wheel, chief? Shrek! Land ho! How humiliating. Oh, nice going, Your Highness. Now it's ""Your Highness"" ? What happened to "" loser"" ? If you think this is getting you out of anything, it isn't . We're heading back to Far Far Away one way or another... ...and you're going to be a father! What? You just said ""father"" . King! You're going to be king! ""You're going to be king!"" Yeah, right. Where are you going? Far Far Away... from you! Get back here, young man! Boss? I don't think he's coming back. Maybe it's for the best. He's not exactly king material. When did you plan to tell him you were supposed to be king? Oome on. Why would I do that? Besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me. Then change your tactics if you want to get anywhere with him. You're right, Donkey. What about this? - Shrek! - Oome on. It's just a joke. Still... Listen, Artie. If you think this whole mad scene ain't dope, I feel you, dude. I'm not trying to get up in your grill or raise your roof. But what I am screamin' is, yo... ...check out this kazing thazing, bazaby! If it doesn't groove, or what I'm saying ain't straight trippin', say, "" Oh, no, you didn't ! You're getting on my last nerve."" And then I'll know it's ... I'll know it's wack! Help! I've been kidnapped by a monster who's trying to relate to me! - Artie, wait. - Oome on! Help! Hello? Greetings, cosmic children of the universe. Welcome to my serenity circle. Please leave any bad vibes outside the healing vortex. Now prepare to... I knew I should have got that warranty! Mr. Merlin? You know this guy? Yeah. He was the school magic teacher, until he had his nervous breakdown. Technically, I was merely a victim of a level 3 fatigue. At the request of my therapist, and the school authorities, I retired to the tranquility of nature to discover my divine purpose. Oan I interest anyone in a snack or beverage? Uh, no. Sure you don't want to try my Rock Au Gratin? It's organic. Thanks. I ate a boulder on the way in. We need directions to Far Far Away. ""We"" ? Who said I was going with you? I did. People are counting on you, so don't try to weasel out of it. If the job's so great, you do it. Understand this, kid. No more Mr. Nice Guy from here on out. That was your Mr. Nice Guy? Yeah, and I'm going to miss him. Why don't you go terrorize a village and leave me alone! Was that a crack about ogres? You get your royal highness to Far Far Away... ...before I kick it there! Now, which way am I kicking? I could tell you, but since you're in the midst of a self-destructive rage spiral, it would be karmically irresponsible. Self-destructive...? Are you going to help us or not? Most definitely, but only after you take the journey to your soul! I don't think so. It's either that or primal scream therapy. All right. Journey to the soul. Now, all of you, look into the Fire of Truth and tell me what you see. Ooh, charades! Okay, I see a Dutch fudge torte with cinnamon swirls! Okay, monster... go for it. I see a rainbow pony. Excellent work! Now the boy. This is lame. You're lame! Now just go for it. Okay. There's a baby bird and a father bird sitting in a nest. Yes! Stay with it! The dad just flew away. Why did he leave the little bird all alone? It's trying to fly, but it doesn't know how to. It's going to fall! Proper head case you are. Really messed up. Okay, I get it. The bird's me. My dad left. So what? Look, Artie, um... Just thought I'd help set the mood... ...for your big heart-to-heart chat. I know what it's like to not feel ready for something. Even ogres get scared. You know... once in a while. I know you want me to be king, but I can't . I'm not cut out for it, and I never will be. Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth the trouble. He dumped me at that school first chance he got... ...and I never heard from him again. My dad wasn't really the fatherly type, either. I doubt he was worse than mine. Oh, yeah? My father was an ogre. He tried to eat me. I guess I should have realized it. He bathed me in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth. I guess that's pretty bad. It may be hard to believe, what, with my obvious charm and good looks, but people used to think I was a monster. And for a long time, I believed them. But after a while, you learn to ignore the names people call you and just trust who you are. You know... you're okay, Shrek. You just need to do a little less yelling and use a little more soap. Thanks, Artie. The soap's because you stink... really bad. Yeah... I got that. This place is filthy! I feel like a hobo. I'm sorry, but this isn't working for me. Everything's always about you. It's not like your attitude is helping. Maybe itjust bothers you I was voted fairest in the land. You mean in that rigged election? Give me a break. "" Rapunzel, Rapunzel... ...let down thy golden extensions!"" Ladies, let go of your petty complaints and let's work together! So I guess the plan is we just wander aimlessly in this stinkhole until we rot. No, we get inside and find out what Oharming's up to. I know he's a jerk and everything, but that Oharming makes me hotter than July. That's it! Oome on! This way! Rapunzel, wait! Oharming, let go of her. But why would I want to do that? What? Say hello, ladies, to the new Queen of Far Far Away. Rapunzel, how could you? Jealous much? Soon you'll be back where you started, scrubbing floors or locked away in towers. That is, if I let you last the week. Pookie, you promised not to hurt them. Not here, kitten whiskers. Daddy will discuss it later. Now forgive us. We have a show to put on. Shrek will be back soon, and you'll be sorry. Sorry?! Don't you realize once Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away... ...he's doomed? Look out! They got a piano! Kill them all... except the fat one. King Oharming has something special in mind for you, ogre. King Oharming? Attack! Artie, duck! Ready the plank! - Shrek! - Help! Oowards! What has Oharming done with Fiona? She's going to get what's coming to her. And there ain't nothing you can do to stop him! - We've got to save her. - But she's so far far away! Get yourself back to Worcestershire, kid. No, Shrek. Hold on. I've got an idea. I am a buzzing bee. Mr. Merlin? They need a spell to get them... ...I mean us, back to Far Far Away. Forget it. I don't have that kind of magic in me anymore. How about a hug? That's the best kind of magic. Please. I know you can do it. I said forget it! But... What's with you? It's just so hard, you know? They need to get back, 'cause their kingdom's in trouble. 'Cause there's a really bad man. It's just so hard! Take it easy. No! I don't think you understand! There's a mean person doing mean things to good people. Have a heart, old man. They really need your help to get back. Why won't you help them?! Okay. I'll go get my things. Piece of cake. Well, well. You want eggs with that ham? I am a little rusty, so there could be some side effects. - Side effects? - Don't worry. Whatever it is, no matter how excruciatingly painful, it will wear off eventually. I think. - Oops. - You sure about this? If Artie trusts him, that's good enough for me. Even if his robe doesn't cover... Alacritious expeditious... ...a-zoomy-zoom-zoom! Let's help our friends get back... ...soon! It worked! I haven't been on a trip like that since college! Donkey? What? Is something in my teeth? Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into a Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick! At least you don't look like some kind of bloated piata! You should think about going on a diet! You should get yourself a pair of pants. I feel all exposed and nasty! So you two think this is funny? I'm really sorry, guys. Don't be. You got us back, kid. How in the Hans Ohristian Andersen am I supposed to parade around in these goofy boots? Hey, hey, hey! Be very careful with those. They were made in Madrid by the finest... You'll learn to control that. Seriously. Ow! You need some comfort inserts or arch supports or something. Watch it. I'm walking here and I'm gonna keep going until... Pinocchio! Shrek! Help me! - What happened? - Oharming and the villains took over! Fiona and the Princesses got away. Now she's ... She's what?! What?! Puss! Loan me five bucks. You heard him. Help the brother out. Do you see any pockets on me? Hold on a second. I had no idea, really. I... I swear. Quick! Where is Fiona? Oharming has her locked away someplace. You have to find him! He's probably getting ready for the show! Wait, Pinocchio! What show? "" It's a Happily Ever After After All"" . "" Shrek's final performance"" ? Shrek! You didn't tell us you were in a play! I guess I've been so busy I forgot to mention it. The ogre! Get him! Don't worry, jefe. I got this. Uck! Kill it! Look. Don't you know who he thinks he is? How dare you! We're dealing with amateurs. He's a star, people! Hello? I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek. I'm going to lose it! Is everything ready? You did get the list for the dressing room? Breakfast croissant stuffed with seared sashimi tuna. And I hope you have the saffron corn with jalapeno honey butter. Our client cannot get into his proper emotional state withoutjalapeno honey butter! I just lost it. They should talk to Nancy in Human Resources. Oh, we will have much to say to Nancy, I promise! ""With this sword, I do..."" No. ""With..."" ""With this sword, I do smote thee!"" Is "" smote"" the right word? "" Smoot"" ? I don't think that's a word. Maybe I should just "" smite"" him. Let's try this again. Now... Shrek attacks me. I pretend to be afraid. "" Now the kingdom will get the happily ever after they deserve. Die, ogre!"" Blah, blah, blah. Oh, itjust doesn't feel real enough! Who told you to stop dancing?! Wink and turn. What are you laying around for? Get up! Honestly! Our happily ever after is nearly complete, Mummy. And I assure you... ...the people of this kingdom will pay dearly for every second... ...we've had to wait. Break a leg. On second thought, let me break it for you. Thank goodness. I was afraid you wouldn't get back in time. Where's Fiona? Don't worry. She and the others are safe... for now. Let me guess. Arthur. It's Artie, actually. This boy is supposed to be the new King of Far Far Away? How pathetic. Stand still, so I won't make a mess. Oharming, stop! I'm here now. You got what you wanted. This isn't about him. Then who's it about? I'm supposed to be king, right? You weren't really next in line for the throne. I was. But you said the King asked for me personally. Not exactly. What does that mean? I said whatever I had to say, all right? I wasn't right for the job, so I needed some fool to replace me. And you fit the bill. So just go! You were playing me the whole time. You catch on real fast, kid. Maybe you're not as big of a loser as I thought. You know, for a minute... - ...I actually thought... - What? That he cared about you? He's an ogre. What did you expect? You really do have a way with children, Shrek. Leave me out with the waste This is not what I do It's the wrong time She's pulling me through It's a small crime And I got no excuse And is that all right, yeah? Is that all right with you? Is that all right, yeah? If I give my gun away when it's loaded? If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it? Is that all right? Is that all right? Is that all right with you? No. No. Had we stayed put like I suggested, we'd be sipping tea out of little heart-shaped cups. Yeah, heart-shaped cups. And eating crumpets smothered with loganberries. Yeah, loganberries. - Shut up, Oindy. - Yeah, shut up. - No, you shut up. - Stay out of this. Who cares who's "" running the kingdom"" ? - I care. - You should all care. I have your badge number, tin can! - Donkey? - Princess! Puss? I am Puss, stuck here inside this hideous body. And I'm me! But you're... Everything's fruity in the loops, but what happened is we went to high school, the boat crashed and we got bippity-boppity-booped by the magic man. You poor sweet things. I don't get it. The cat turned into a little horse that smells like feet. What's to get? Who dat? Where's Shrek? Oharming has him. He plans to kill Shrek tonight in front of the whole kingdom! All right, everyone. We need to find a way out now. You're right. Ladies, assume the position! What are you doing? Waiting to be rescued. You've got to be kidding me. What else can we do? We're just four... ...I mean three, super-hot princesses... ...two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre and an old lady! Excuse me. Old lady coming through. Mom! You didn't think you got your fighting skills from your father, did you? Excuse me. There's still one more. Why don't you just lie down? Okay, girls, from here on out... ...we take care of business ourselves. The Far Far Away Theatre at the Charming Pavilion is proud to present... ...""It's A Happily Ever After After AII."" Enjoy your evening of theatrical reverie, citizen. Oi! No food or beverages in the theater! Places, everyone! Easy! Sorry. I was showing off for the little one. It's Bring Your Kids to Work Day. Oome here, beautiful. Well, she's got your eye. Who would have thought a monster like me deserved something as special as you? Little birdies, take wing Flitting down from the trees they appear And to chirp in my ear All because I sing Move it! Go! My babies! Help! Hey, how's it goin' O to the K. The coast is clear. Let's do this. Go, Team Dynamite! I thought we agreed to use the name Team Super Oool. I recall it was Team Awesome. I voted for Team Alpha Wolf Squadron. Okay! From henceforth, we will be Team Alpha Super Awesome Oool Dynamite Wolf Squadron. Ach de liebe! There is some strange little girl over there staring at us! Artie! Wait, wait! Where is the fire, seor? Please. Don't act so innocent. You both knew what was going on and kept it to yourselves. It's not like it seems. It's not? I think it seems pretty clear. He was using me. That's all. Using you? You really don't get it. Shrek only said those things to protect you. Oharming was going to kill you, Artie! Shrek saved your life. Oue the spot! I wait alone up here I'm trapped another day Locked up here, please set me free My new life I almost see A castle, you and me Yes, a castle, you and me Oherubs! Tis I, Tis I Upon my regal steed Princess, my love At last you shall be freed I'm strong And brave And dashing my way there With speed! With might! With soft and bouncy hair! - Through the blistering desert - Hot! - Across the stormiest sea - Wet! Facing creatures so vile Foul! So you can gaze upon me! I knew you'd come for me And now we finally meet I knew you'd wait And from my plate of love you'd eat Who is this terribly ugly fiend Who so rudely intervened? Will Charming fight or flee? Please rescue me! From this monstrosity! Fear thee not, honey lamb! I will slice this thing up like a ham! Oh, boy. You are about to enter a world of pain With which you are not familiar! It can't be any more painful than your lousy performance. "" Prepare, foul beast."" Prepare, foul beast, your time is done! Oould you kill me and then sing? Be quiet! I'm just having fun with you. That's actually a very nice leotard. Thank you. Do they come in men's sizes? Now that be funny! Enough! Now you'll finally know what it's like... ...to have everything you worked for... ...everything that's precious to you, taken away. Now you'll know how I felt. Sausage roll! Pray for mercy from Puss! And Donkey! D Hi, honey. Sorry we're late. You okay? Much better, now that you're here. So, Oharming, you want to let me out of these so we can settle this ogre-to-man? Ooh, that sounds fun. But I have a better idea. No! Let go of me! You will not ruin things this time, ogre. Kill it. Everybody, stop! Oh, what is it now?! Artie? Who thinks we need to settle things this way? You mean you want to be villains your whole lives? But we are villains! It's the only thing we know. You never wish you could be something else? Easy for you to say. You're not some evil enchanted tree. You morons! Don't listen to him! Attack! What Steve means is it's hard to come by honest work when the whole world's against you. Right. Thanks, Ed. Fair enough. You're right. I'm not a talking tree. But you know... ...a good friend once told me... ...just because people treat you like a villain, or an ogre... ...orjust some loser... ...doesn't mean you are one. What matters most is what you think of yourself. If there's something you really want, or someone you want to be... ...the only person standing in your way is you. - Me? - Get him! No, no, no! What I mean is each of you... ...is standing in your own way. I always wanted to play the flute. I'd like to open up a spa... in France! I grow daffodils. And they're beautiful. A new era finally begins! Now all of you... ...bow before your King! You need to work on your aim. This was supposed to be my happily ever after! Well, you need to keep looking... ...because I'm not giving up mine. Mommy? It's yours if you want it. But this time it's your choice. Author! Artie! Artie! Artie! Artie! Excuse me. That's my seat. Okay, Seor Hocusy-Pocusy, the time has come to rectify some wrongs! Though I have been enjoying these cat baths. Please say you didn't . All right! Look. You'll feel a pinch and possibly lower intestinal discomfort... ...but this should do the trick. - Are you...? - I'm me again! - And I am not you! - All right! Oops. Ah, never mind. What did I tell you? The kid's going to be a great king. Well, for what it's worth, you would have, too. I have something much more important in mind. Finally. Dada. Was I wrong about the world? It's a beautiful new place I smell Shrek Junior! Where else could a creep like me Meet such a pretty face Meeting every day with the rising sun Looking up, it's looking like My losing streak is done Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! A bouncy, bouncy, boy! Used to always feel like Wished that I was dressed better Where's the baby? Never had a lot of luck Until I finally met her Meeting every day with the rising sun Looking up, it's looking like My losing streak is done My losing streak is done Well... what shall we do now?

Want to thank you Just to be my Because I just want to be my... See? Can I, can I thank you! Can I Yes! Yes!, We come together today... In dark times such as these, we must all remember to look to the Lord for guidance. Submit yourselves, then, to God. Amen. Resist the Devil... ...and he will flee from you. I regret to say I know the powers of Satan firsthand. Our very own daughter was taken by perverts and swindlers and let fall into a world of sin. Sheriff? I hope... You ought to come take a look at this. My God. Go easy on that stuff, will ya? You know what they say about too much of a good thing... Give me some sugar. You're special. There ain't nobody else out there like you. Now giddyup. Time is money. Everybody is waiting. You're a fucking sex symbol.  In the summertime  When the weather is hot  You can stretch right up and touch the sky  When the weather's fine  You got women You got women on your mind  Have a drink, have a drive  Go out and see what you can find  If her daddy's rich Take her out for a meal  If her daddy's poor Just do what you feel  Speed along the lane  Do a turn or return the twenty-five  When the sun goes down  You can make it Make it good and really fine  We're not bad people  We're not dirty We're not mean  We love everybody But we do as we please  When the weather's fine  We go fishin' or go swimmin' in the sea  We're always happy  Life's for livin', yeah That's our philosophy  Highs in the low... America needs Jesus... Maxine. ""The Farmer's Daughters."" Oh, hot damn. Look-it, there I am. Wow. Hollywood, here we come. No, ma'am. We don't need Hollywood. These type of pictures turn regular folks into stars. We're gonna do it all ourselves. - Ain't that right, RJ? - Yes, sir. Finally, a level playing field for people like us. I don't know, Wayne. Sounds an awful lot like what you said about The Topless Carwash. You remember that? Yeah. And had the IRS not had a goddamn personal vendetta against me, that would've panned out beautifully. Uh-huh. Well, you know I'm always game. My American Dream is not unreasonable. I just want a paid-for house with a big ole pool, so I can float around with my knees in the breeze and tan these titties. What? I was dealt a good hand. People spend a lot of money to look at what God gave me. Be a sin not to take care of 'em. Mmm. Yes, it sure would. What about you, Maxine? What's your American Dream? Hmm. Hurry it up, we aren't gonna be long in there. If this kid I picked up from the university can put it together like he says, our days of struggling may soon be over. We do even half the numbers of Debbie Does Dallas, I'm outta the red for good. Hell, let's make a picture a week, then. Patience, darlin'. I've been being patient my whole life. Well, that's the thing about being patient. - I need to be famous, Wayne. - Mmm-hmm. I'm ready for the high life. I'm sick and tired of never gettin' what I want. Well, you help me keep those jokers in line out there, I'll make sure you get everything your heart desires. You better have. I don't wanna worry no more, Wayne. I deserve nice things. I have cosmopolitan taste. - Don't I know it. - I mean it. I want the whole world to know my name. Like Lynda Carter or some shit. Hey, everyone with a pulse is gonna lust after a piece of Maxine Minx once they see what you can do. You know why? Why? 'Cause you got that X factor. Fuckin'-A-right. Now, mosey on over there and grab us some Wonder Bread, Wonder Woman. I don't like his girlfriend. You don't like anybody's girlfriend. She hardly says a word. She just stares at everyone. Well, she's shy. Probably ain't never seen nobody like us before. People who stare give me the heebie-jeebies. Better get used to that if you're gonna be in the movies. Your little boyfriend is cute. You help him with all his films? Sometimes, yeah. Is that your boyfriend? Sometimes, yeah. Hey, how come you don't gotta film none of this in order? Well, once I have it all in the can, I can rearrange it however I want. No shit. I actually intend on experimenting a lot with the film's editing. Giving it a certain sense of the avant-garde, like they're doing in France. It's classier that way. And it's a good trick to disguise the low budget. All right, let's slate it. And hit it. All right, go ahead and fill her up. You know, if you tilt the camera up from the nozzle... ...it'll look like he's using his cock. See? I got good sense, too. How come we couldn't do any of this filming in Houston? Ain't they got plenty of farms? Well, this county raised property taxes, a little bit of cash goes a long way out here. Most older folks can't compete with the bigger outfits no more. Now, we're not the only ones trying to make a buck. Kidnappers, murderers, sex fiends... All the result of our increasingly secular society... Besides, it ain't exactly something I wanna advertise around town. You know how some people can get when it comes to sex. Remember what happened in Sodom and Gomorrah. - Get what we needed? - Oh, I got it. Thanks to help from yours truly. - Got my smokes? - Yes. God damn. I'm just askin'. Hey, if I'm gonna be having sex for you, I'm gonna need cigarettes. How's the script? I don't know. It's all right. Does it matter? Hey, I don't wanna have to wear a hard hat to make a livin', do you? No. Then don't you be bringin' down the vibe of my investments. Negativity attracts negative results. Winstons? You know I only smoke Old Golds. All they had, Bobby-Lynne. That's it. I'm calling my agent. Just get back in the dang van. Mmm-mmm! That's right. The deviants are already amongst us, waiting for our sons and daughters. So, heed dire warnings, and repent before it is too late. He may be a forgiving God, but every man has got his limits. Must be a bad wreck. Y'all stay safe out there. I'll be right back with some more golden oldies right after this commercial break. 93.5, KBQB. ...the 60th anniversary ...take place this Saturday. Don't miss your chance to tour the entire state... - What is it? - Oh, don't look. I hate blood and guts. Just when you thought you'd escaped the slaughterhouse. Yeah. Now, that's a bonanza... Was that the... This is it. Our own studio backlot. Thank goodness. I'm horny. - You're always horny. - No, not always. It's perfect. It's really gonna add a lot of production value. Y'all stay put while I go and handle business right quick. This wasn't I had in mind when I agreed to help out on your film. Gotta start somewhere, Lorraine. RJ, it's smut. When did you become such a prude? I'm not. I just don't understand why you're doing all this. Because it is possible to make a good dirty movie. Who's that? Yes, sir. It's Wayne Galleroy. We spoke on the telephone. Uh... Howard, right? You from the county? This here's private property. Didn't you see the signs down at the end of the drive? Oh, easy, partner. Somethin's wrong. What'chu talkin' 'bout? You're trespassing. The law says I can shoot. Sir, I ain't from the county. I'm from Houston. We spoke on Tuesday. You remember? About y'all's boarding house. Oh, that's right. You're looking for a place to stay. Well, you never can be too careful with strangers. You had me pretty nervous there. It ain't even loaded. Most of the times, just wavin' it around is all it takes. Oh, yes, sir. I keep the same thing in my glove box. Wow, that's one ugly sumbitch. What? He is. Hell of a spread you got here. We like it. You all right there, old-timer? I'm fine. - She ain't much. - She's gorgeous. Building was for soldiers during the Civil War. They never saw any action though. What about you? You serve? Flat feet. I did. Two tours in South Vietnam. Had enough farmers tryin' to shoot me for one lifetime. Know what I mean, Pops? Oorah. Oh, careful, Howie. Hot damn, that's my future fiancee you're eyeballin' there. Been a while since you seen anythin' that nice? I don't recall you mentioning you'd bringing all these others. Now, about that... See, your ad said $30, but... I threw in a little extra to sweeten the deal. I hope that's okay. I don't think I like you, Wayne. In fact, I don't much like the looks of none of y'all. Now, my wife is next door, so I would appreciate a little discretion. I give you my word. You won't even know we're here. That was some stellar negotiating. You really do have a knack for business. You keep jawin', towhead, I'll pull you off the main stage for a month. Oh, but then, honey, you won't make no money neither. How could you just stand there and let him talk about us like that? Oh, calm down. Ain't no need to harsh the mellow. It's harmless. He's just old. His pecker ain't probably been hard since before you were born. I'd hate people like us then, too. He don't know what we're doing, does he? So, church mouse, you do speak. No. He sure doesn't. And I intend to keep it that way. Now, I don't wanna give the old codger a heart attack. Would you? It's better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission. You know what I mean? All right. That's enough jabberin'. I reckon it's about high time we cut to the chase and we give the people what they wanna see. What do you say? Fucking finally! Okay. Now... Now flip her over. Ooh! Oh, yeah. Fuck me. - Yeah. - Fuck. That's great. Just scooch your chin up for me. All right, now slow it all down. - I wanna see the passion. - Hey, kid. How about you just point the camera and stay in your lane. Let me do the screwing here. Yeah! Yes! Oh, my God. Now, I may not know shit from Shinola when it comes to filmmaking, but I know for damn sure people are gonna wanna see what I just saw in there. Well, that's 'cause I'm not treatin' it like pornography, but as cinema. That's what these other adult films are lackin'. Whatever you're doin', you keep doin' it. People's eyes are gonna pop out of their damn skulls when they see this. We're gonna be rich. Feel how hard my cock is. Oh, sorry, baby. Don't be standing there like you're all proud of yourself. I was born for this line of work. Uh. You didn't do nothin', dummy. It's called actin'. You good, but you ain't that good. Fuck my pussy. Oh, you make me so wet. Oh, my God, you're so big. Aw, don't look so glum. You did just fine. Come here. I think I love you. Bless your heart. And action! Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but my van broke down on the highway back yonder, and I was hopin' I could use y'all's phone to call for help. Oh, my goodness. I'm afraid we don't own a telephone, but my daddy will be home soon, and I'm sure he could give you a lift to town. Would you like to come inside? Much obliged. Hello? Hello? Lemonade? Sure is hot out there. You must be awful thirsty. Yes, ma'am. It's got a good taste. I should probably get back now. My boyfriend gets real fussy when he don't know where I'm at, so... Come with me before Daddy gets home. I was young once, too. It was taken right before the first war. Believe it or not, my Howard served in both. He survived the trenches and Omaha Beach. There wasn't anything he wouldn't do for me back then. That's the power of beauty. I was a dancer in those early years. But then the war came, so... Not everything in life turns out how you expect. Such a special face. Beautiful. Look. I don't know what's come over me. I've never quite felt like this before. If Daddy catches us, there's no telling what he might do. What are you doing? You should go. It will be our secret. What will? Shh. Watch out! I've been looking everywhere for you! Sorry. The kid says we're gonna lose the light! Well, come on now, chop-chop. You're not good. Bluff it. You're a fucking sex symbol. I will not accept a life I do not deserve. Are you ready? Let's go to work. Coast is clear. - Right... - Sound speed. Okay, we're rollin'. Farmer's Daughter, take one. Action. I'm looking for the owner of this farm. His daughter said I could find him in here. You must have been talking to my sister. Sister? - She didn't mention you. - Not surprised. She's always been jealous. I'm younger, get all the attention. Daddy never lets her leave the farm anymore. He's very protective. Well, I was hopin' he could give me a ride back to town before it got dark. We shouldn't disturb him. It would only make him angry. You wouldn't like Daddy when he's angry. I could give you a ride. We talked about this. Howard? Please. You know I can't. My heart...  They're gonna put me in the movies  They're gonna make a big star out of me  They'll make a film about a girl  Who's sad and lonely  And all I gotta do is act naturally  You were amazing out there. Now I know why Wayne left his wife for you. So do I. Careful. Told y'all she was somethin' special. X factor. Thanks, baby. What are you looking at? Wait, come on now. No, Wayne. Anybody ever teach you not to stare? It's rude. You got somethin' to say to me or what? No. Well, I do have a question. See, she's interested, is all. What's on your mind, church mouse? Isn't it strange watching her doin' it with him? It's just business. As long as the camera is runnin'. So the camera changes things? That's right. It's not real life, Raine. It's just a movie. I know that. Just sayin'. What about love? What about love? Well, don't y'all believe in it? Of course we believe in love. How can you love someone and still be with other people? You think we don't have no morals or somethin', is that it? No. No, I just... Take it from me, letting outdated traditions control how you live your life will get you nowhere. I don't know about you, but I got better places to be than where I came from. Amen to that. And besides, it's just sex. You can decide who you wanna love, but not who you wanna screw. Attraction's out of our control. It ain't healthy keeping those feelings locked away inside. I seen you sneaking a few long peeks at Jackson over here. - No, I... I wasn't looking... - It's okay. He don't mind none. She's right. I don't mind. No offense. Everybody likes sex. It's a gas. We're just not afraid to admit it. Queer, straight, Black, white... It's all disco. You know why? Because one day, we're gonna be too old to fuck. And life's too short, if you ask me. Roger that. The fact of the truth of the matter is, we turn folks on. - And that scares 'em. - They can't look away neither. That's right. We're like a foxy car wreck. Which is how I know that this new home video market is set to explode. Finally, people are gonna get to see what they desire in the privacy of their own homes, free of judgment. We're gonna give that to them before anyone else. Porn ain't only gonna be - for perverts no more. - Aw. Toast to the perverts. They've been payin' our bills for years. Hear, hear! To the perverts! To livin' a life of excess, being young and having fun till the day we die. To the power of independent cinema. To living life on our own terms. And never accepting what self-righteous naysayers have to say. Right on. I don't know if I agree with all of that, but I did like what I saw today. I didn't think I would, but I did. Cheers to that. - You ready? - Yeah.  I took my love I took it down  I climbed a mountain and I turned around  And I saw my reflection  In the snow-covered hills  Till the landslide brought me down  Oh, mirror in the sky What is love?  Can the child within my heart rise above?  Can I sail  Through the changin' ocean tides?  Can I handle the seasons  Of my life?  Well, I've been afraid  Of changin'  'Cause I built my life  Around you  But time makes you bolder  Even children get older  And I'm gettin' older too I wanna do a scene in the movie. What? I wanna be in the movie. No. Well, why not? Well... Because... No. Did y'all put her up to this or somethin'? - No! - Hey! Take it easy. They didn't do nothin'. Nobody put me up to anything. I've been thinking about it all day. And... Well, I'm young. And if we really are makin' a good dirty movie, then I don't wanna just carry the equipment. I wanna be in it. Well, you can't. Says who? It's my film, Lorraine. I mean, it wouldn't make any sense. We've already shot half of it. The story can't just suddenly change midway through. Why? Because it just isn't done. What about in Psycho? You love that movie. Well, Psycho is a horror film. And that plot was a MacGuffin to build suspense. And I'm not making that kind of movie. Oh, come on, RJ. Nobody's comin' to see this film for the plot. They're comin' to see tits and ass. - And a big dick. - Lorraine! It's the truth. Why not just give the people what they're payin' for? Because I'm making something better than that. When did you become such a prude? All right, hold on. I am the executive producer, which means I get a word. So, why don't we just take a step outside before anythin' gets said that someone might regret. You gotta back me up in here, Wayne! I mean, this situation is fixin' to get outta control. It is awfully close. Relax. Hey, what is it they say, ""Life imitates art""? It's the other way around. Whatever, it don't matter. But you need to listen to me, okay? Because you ain't been 42, and I have been 23. And I'm gonna explain somethin' to you about young women. Now, if she's serious, which I suspect she is, she's gonna do it whether you like it or not. Now, you try to stop her, not only is she gonna do it, she's gonna go on and do it with God knows how many people in God knows how many other films, and nobody wants that. The way I see it, you only got one good option here. What, letting her get balled by some man whore? Come on now, Jackson is a professional. He ain't got no diseases or nothin'. You just want more sex in the movie. That ain't me, hoss. She wants it, you heard her. Heck, if she does great, she gets famous, maybe she'll take you with her. Wayne, you don't get it. Lorraine is not like the others in there. She is a nice girl. I beg your pardon? No, I didn't mean it like that. Oh, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but ain't none of them nice girls. To hell with this. She can have it. Let's see how far they get without me. Good luck finding your own way out of here. What the... Ma'am? Are you all right? Sorry, I'm... Ma'am? What? How come you just did that? Why won't you look at me? Look at me like you looked at her. What? I can show you what I'm capable of. Stop. I don't wanna see it. Maybe we should just go find your husband. Help me.  Oui, oui, Marie  If you'll do this for me  Then I'll do that for you  Oui, oui, Marie  Come on, baby Don't fear the reaper  RJ? RJ? Hey, hey, hey. What's goin' on, church mouse? It's RJ. I woke up, and he was gone. I... You don't think he left me, do you? Well, the van's still here. He's gotta be around somewhere. Oh, hey, it ain't like your dog ran off. He's probably just processin' things, you know? Go on back to bed. I feel bad if I hurt him. I don't wanna break up. Hun, you didn't do nothin' wrong. He'll get over it. He just needs to toughen up, is all. Come on. I'll talk to him in the morning. Will you help me find him? Please? I'm worried. All right. I ain't gettin' in the middle of no more of this shit. RJ! Are you in here, brother? This ain't the way to go about handlin' this. Oh, no. I'm sorry if I disturbed you. What are you doin' out here? I'm lookin' for my boyfriend. Have you seen my wife? No, sir. Two keys to keepin' a healthy relationship. Never let a good woman out of your sight. Never mention her weight. How do you think I've been surrounded by so many beautiful females my whole life? There's an art to it. Just like business. Fuck! Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck me! Oh, shut up, cheeseburger! Go wander into traffic. Oh, fuck. RJ, you in here? I stepped on a nail. Come on out and help me, for Christ's sake! I'm gonna catch tetanus from this shit. RJ? Church mouse, that you? There's another light down in the cellar. Can you go get it? Please. My wife is not well. It's very dark, and I'm worried she could fall and break her hip. Downstairs. You'll see my workbench. Found it! Hey, I'm locked in! Hey! Hey! Hey! Open up! What is it, baby? Thought I heard somethin'. Probably nothin'. Old habits die hard. Go back to sleep. Aye, aye, captain. Everything okay, Pops? My wife, she's gone missing. Missin'? She gets confused. It happens sometimes after dark. Lot of firepower for a missin' wife. It's for gators. I found her once by the edge of our pond. If she was to fall in... Want some help? Not for self but for country, right? Let me go and get my skivvies. I say we each take a side of the perimeter. Cover ground quicker that way. I only got the one light. No offense, but it's been a while since you was deployed. I spent three nights face down in a rice paddy scanning for land mines and trip wires. Once a marine, always a marine. If she's out here... I'll find her. I got nothin', Pops. Shit. What you doing all the way in there? Oh, no. Pops, you okay? You in here? Help! Help, somebody, please! Please help me! RJ! Help! Oh, shit! You scared me, Pops. Once a marine, always a marine. Well... Your lady ain't in there. I can't give her what she wants anymore. You don't understand what it's like. You can still do as you please. Say what? The last bohemian that stayed here was the same. Traipsin' around in barely any clothes. Enticin' my wife. Yeah... Okay, well, we better get back up to the house and find out what's goin' on. I know exactly what's goin' on. Maxine? That woman was in my bed touching me! You're just makin' things worse. Help me! Somebody! Please! Nobody is comin' for ya. Get back down in that cellar and be quiet! - Shut up! - Help! - Hey! Somebody, please! - Kidnappers, murderers, sex fiends, lurkin' where we least expect... Help! - Somebody, help! - ...in good Christian homes, right under our very noses! Jackson? Wayne? Where are y'all? Oh, my goodness. Ma'am? Ma'am? Be careful! Step away from the edge, it's dangerous. It's all right. Here, here. You're safe now, okay? Are you hurt? I don't see anything. My nana gets confused sometimes as well. I learned all about it. Believe it or not, I've even thought about becomin' a nurse one day. So... Okay. Why don't you come with... Oh! What the hell did you do that for? I don't need a nurse. Why should you get to have it all? What have you ever done except be a whore? Okay, you know what? You don't want my help? No problem. I was just tryin' to be nice. You don't deserve to be able to just flaunt it in my face like you do. It ain't my fault you didn't live the life you wanted. Now move out of the way, please. Move! You mean old ugly b... Bitch. Was that the one? You know I don't like blondes. Disgustin'. Lorraine? RJ? Uh, place is empty. What about that other fella, Wayne? In the barn. Stuck like the pig he was. Well, that's three down. Four. And I got another kept up at the house for you. I don't want her. This one was different. She had something special. Like I did. Sick and tired of never gettin' what I want. You know I want to give it to you, Pearl. But I'm tired, too. I know. Tell me I'm special. Of course you are. I've felt that way since the first moment we met. You were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. Oh, not anymore. Always. Tell me I'm yours. That you still want me. Make me feel young again. What if my heart can't take it? It can. Fuck me, Howard. Fuck me. Fuck me. Help! Help! Somebody, help me, please! Let me out of here! Keep your voice down. Don't tell me to be quiet! I was locked in a dungeon down there! These old people are fucking crazy! I have to get out of this house before they kill me, too. We need to find the keys to their truck. I never should have listened to you. This is all your fault! Lorraine, we need to stick together. I hate you! I hate you all so much! Lorraine! I told her to stay in the damn cellar! That's all right. We don't need her anymore. We got each other again. Help me drag the body inside. If she's in the house, that's self-defense. That's the law. You don't really believe anyone's gonna come looking for 'em, do you? We ain't gonna risk it. We need to play this smart, Pearl. No sense in making a mess now. If nobody shows up by tomorrow, we'll take the body and we'll dump her in the pond with the others. Which reminds me, we're gonna need to get Wayne outta the barn and sink him, too. She's heavier than she looks. Howard. Howard! Howard? Howard? Howard! Where are the keys to the truck? - He's having a heart attack. - I don't give a shit! - Where are the fucking keys? - Well, now... - In the kitchen... - ...here we all are... - ...under the lamp. - ...together. Howard? We have reached a crossroad. With salvation... - Howard? - ...or damnation? You're gonna rot when people find out what you've done. The time is now. - What I have done? - For if we do not take control - of our own fate, the Lord... - What about you? ...shall do it for us. You don't think I know who you really are? I saw what you did in the barn. You're a deviant little whore. We're the same. You'll end up just like me. Time to turn our backs on sin and make the commitment... I'm nothin' like you. ...once and for all. You're a kidnappin', murderin' sex fiend. I'm a fucking star! The whole world is gonna know my name. I want to hear you all. Say it with me now. I will not accept a life - I do not deserve. - I will not accept a life I do not deserve. Hallelujah! Stop fuckin' starin' at me! Now, that's what I call divine intervention! The Lord smiles on those who accept Him. Praise his name! Glory be to Jesus! My hip... Help. Shh! You whore! You're not innocent! You're not special! It'll all be taken from you! Just like it was from me! I'll tell everyone what you are! It'll be our secret. Divine intervention. Praise the fuckin' Lord. I hope that, through my own admission, others may find the light. I wanna show y'all somethin'. Get a shot of this. There she is. My beautiful little daughter Maxine. Lured into a life of sin by the very deviants we warn of here on a daily basis. From our lovin' home into the hands of devils. We pray, one day, she'll find her way home to us. Amen. Bless you, bless you. What do you reckon happened, Sheriff? How the hell should I know? Hey, boss. One of the boys found this inside. What do you think is on it? Well, by the looks of everythin'... I'd say one goddamn fucked up horror picture. <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, - Good night, sweetheart. - Good night, Mom. Sleep tight, kiddo. Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated. All right, Mr Bile, is it? Uh, my friends call me Phlegm. Uh-huh. Mr Bile, can you tell me what you did wrong? - I fell down? - No, no, before that. Can anyone tell me Mr Bile's big mistake? Anyone? Let's take a look at the tape. Here we go. Uh, right... buh, buh, buh, buh... Ah, there. See? The door. You left it wide open. And leaving the door open is the worst mistake... any employee can make because... Um, it could let in a draught? It could let in a child! Oh, Mr Waternoose! There's nothing more toxic or deadly than a human child. A single touch could kill you. Leave a door open and a child could walk right into this factory... right into the monster world. I won't go in a kid's room! You can't make me! You're going in there because we need this. Our city is counting on you to collect those children's screams. Without scream, we have no power. Yes, it's dangerous work, and that's why I need you to be at your best. I need scarers who are confident, tenacious, tough, intimidating. I need scarers like... like... James P. Sullivan. Hey, good morning, Monstropolis. It's now five after the hour of 6:00 a.m... in the big monster city. Temperature's a balmy 65 degrees, which is good news for you reptiles... and it looks like it's gonna be a perfect day to maybe, hey, just lie in bed, sleep in... or simply work out that flab that's hanging over the bed! Get up, Sulley! I don't believe I ordered a wake-up call, Mikey. Hey, less talk, more pain, marshmallow boy. Feel the burn! You call yourself a monster? Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet. Oh, the kid's awake! Okay, scary feet, scary feet, scary feet, scary feet, scary... Kid's asleep! Twins and a bunk bed! Ooh, I thought I had you there. Okay, Sulley, here we go. You ready? Follow it. Oh, it's over here. Oh, look over there. Don't let the kid touch you! Don't let it touch you! I don't know, but it's been said I love scarin'kids in bed Come on, fight that plaque. Fight that plaque. Scary monsters don't have plaque. 118. Do you have 119? Do I see 120? - Oh, I don't believe it! - I'm not even breaking a sweat. Not you. Look! The new commercial's on! The future is bright at Monsters, Incorporated. - I'm in this one! I'm in this one! - We're part of your life. We power your car. We warm your home. We light your city. - I'm Monsters, Incorporated. - Hey, look! Betty! Carefully matching every child to their ideal monster... to produce superior scream... refined into clean, dependable energy. Every time you turn something on, Monsters, Incorporated is there. - I'm Monsters, Incorporated. - We know the challenge. The window of innocence is shrinking. Human kids are harder to scare. Of course, MI is prepared for the future... with the top scarers, the best refineries... and research into new energy techniques. - Okay, here I come. - We're working for a better tomorrow today! We're Monsters, Incorporated! We're MI, Monsters, Incorporated. We scare because we care. - I can't believe it. - Oh, Mike. I was on TV! Ah, did you see me? I'm a natural! Hello? I know! Hey, wasn't I great? Did the whole family see it? It's your mom. What can I say? The camera loves me. I'm telling you, big daddy, you're gonna be seeing this face on TV a lot more often. Yeah? Like on Monstropolis's Most Wanted? You've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade, pal. - Have a good day, sweetie. - You too, hon. - Ooh, okay, Sulley, hop on in. - Nope. Uh-uh. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Where you going? What are you doing? - Mikey, there's a scream shortage. - We're walking. - Walking? - Yup. - No. Hey, no, no. Come on. - Come on. - My baby, look... She needs to be driven. Bye, baby! I... I'll call you! Hey, genius, y-you wanna know why I bought the car, huh? - Not really. - To drive it. You know, like on the street... with the honk-honk and the vroom-vroom and no walking involved. Give it a rest, will you, butterball? Come on. You could use the exercise. I could use the exercise? Look at you. You-You-You have your own climate. How many tentacles jump the rope - Morning, Mike! Morning, Sulley! - One and two and three - Hey, morning, kids! - Hey, kids. - How you doin'? - Bye, Mike! Bye, Sulley! Hey! Aw, nuts. - Hey, hey, hey, fellas! - Hey, Tony! - Tony! - Hey, hey! Tony! - Tony! I hear somebody's close to breaking the all-time scare record. Ah, just trying to make sure there's enough scream to go around. - Hey, on the house! - Hey, thanks! Oh, great. Hey, Ted! Good morning! See that, Mikey? Ted's walking to work. Big deal. Guy takes five steps and he's there. Monsters, Inc. Please hold. Monsters, Inc. Please hold. Monsters, Inc. Please hold. - Morning, Sulley. - Morning, Ricky. - Hey, it's the Sullster. - See you on the scare floor, buddy. - Hey, Marge. Hey, how was jury duty? - Morning, Sulley! - Hey! - Hey, it's still leaning to the left. - It is not! - Hey, fellas. Hey, Jerry. - Hey, Mr Sullivan! Guys, I told ya... call me Sulley. - I don't think so. - We just wanted to wish you good luck today. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, get lost, you two. You're making him lose his focus. - Oh. Sorry. - See you later, fellas. - Go get 'em, Mr Sullivan. - Quiet! - You're making him lose his focus. - Oh, no. Sorry! - Shut up! Monsters, Inc. Please hold. Monsters, Inc. I'll connect you. Ms Fearmonger is on vacation. Would you like her voice mail? Oh, Schmoopsie-poo! Googley Bear! - Happy birthday. - Oh, Googley-woogley, you remembered! - Hey, Sulley-wulley. - Oh, hey, Celia-weelia. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. So, uh, are we going anywhere special tonight? I-I just got us into a little place called, um, Harryhausen's. Harryhausen's? But it's impossible to get a reservation there. Not for Googley Bear. I will see you at quittin' time and not a minute later. - Okay, sweetheart. - Think romantical thoughts. You and me Me and you Both of us together - You know, pal, she's the one. That's it. She is the one. - I'm happy for you. Oh, and, uh, thanks for hooking me up with those reservations. Oh, no problem. They're under the name ""Googley Bear."" Oh, good ide... You know, that wasn't very funny. - What the... - Wazowski! What do you know? It scares little kids and little monsters. - I wasn't scared. I have allergies. - Uh-huh, sure. - Hey, Randall. - Save it for the scare floor, will you? - I'm in the zone today, Sullivan. Gonna be doing some serious scaring, putting up some big numbers. Wow, Randall. That's great. That should make it even more humiliating when we break the record first. Do you hear that? It's the winds of change. ""You hear it? You hear the winds of ch..."" What a creep. One of these days I am really gonna let you teach that guy a lesson. Chalooby baby. Good morning, Roz, my succulent little garden snail. - And who would we be scaring today? - Wazowski. You didn't file your paperwork last night. Oh, that darn paperwork. Wouldn't it be easier if it all just blew away? Don't let it happen again. Yes, well, I'll, uh, I'll try to be less careless. I'm watching you, Wazowski. Always watching. - Ooh, she's nuts. - Always! All scare floors are now active. Assistants, please report to your stations. Okay, people, Eastern Seaboard coming on-line. We got scarers coming out! Ooh, they're so awesome! Hey, may the best monster win. I plan to. We are on in seven, six... five, four, three, two... You're the boss. You're the boss. You're the big, hairy boss. Oh, I'm feelin' good today, Mikey! Yeah! Oh! That-a-boy, that-a-boy. Another door comin' right up. You're still behind, Randall. You know, maybe I should realign the scream intake valve... - Just get me another door! - A door! Yes! Door! Well, Jerry, what's the damage so far? We may actually make our quota today, sir. First time in a month. - What happened? - The kid almost touched me. - She got this close to me. - She wasn't scared of you? She was only six! I could have been dead! I could have died! Keep it together, man. Hey, we got a dead door over here! - We're coming! Look out! - Coming! Back away! Excuse us! We've lost 58 doors this week, sir. Oh, kids these days. They just don't get scared like they used to. Let 'er rip! - Sir? - What? Look. Attention. We have a new scare leader... Randall Boggs. Look at those numbers! Slumber party. - Never mind. - Hey, watch it! Well, James, that was an impressive display. Oh, just doing my job, Mr Waternoose. Of course, I did learn from the best. If I don't see a new door at my station in five seconds... I will personally put you through the shredder! Hey, Wazowski, nice job. Those numbers are pretty sweet. Are they? You know, I hadn't even noticed. - And, uh, how is Georgie doin'? - He's doing great. I love working with that big guy. Keep the doors comin', Charlie. I'm on a roll today. George and I are like brothers... 23-19! We have a 23-19! Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! George Sanderson, please remain motionless. - Prepare for decontamination. - Get it off! Get it off! Duck and cover, people! Oh, not the CD A! - Move! Move! Move! - Coming through, please. Step aside. Clear the contaminated area. - We have a 23-19 in progress. - Keep the area clear. - Coming through. Watch your step. Stand back. Careful. All clear. Situation is niner-niner-zero. Ready for decon. Hey, thanks, guys. That was a close one. Okay. Okay, people, take a break. We gotta shut down for a half hour and reset the system. An entire scare floor out of commission. What else can go wrong? Oh, what a day. We're just going through a rough time, sir. Everyone knows you're gonna get us through it. Tell that to the board of directors. James, this company has been in my family for three generations. I would do anything to keep it from going under. - Well, so would I, sir. - Well... - Say, I could use your help with something. - Anything, sir. You see, we've hired some new scare recruits, and, frankly, they're... they're, um, uh... - Inexperienced? - Oh, they stink! I thought maybe you might come by tomorrow and, uh, give them a demonstration... show them what it takes to be our top scarer, huh? I'll start out with the old Waternoose jump-and-growl. Oh, yes, now, that's my boy! Let's go, everybody. All doors must be returned. No exceptions! - Oh, yeah. - I've never seen anything like you today. - You were on a roll, my man. - Another day like this, and that scare record's in the bag. That's right, baby. So get this. As if dinner wasn't enough, I'm taking her to a monster truck rally afterwards. - Nice. - What's on your agenda? - I'm gonna head home and work out some more. - Again? You know, there's more to life than scaring. Ooh. Hey, can I borrow your odorant? Yeah, I got, uh, Smelly Garbage or Old Dumpster. - You got, uh, Low Tide? - No. - How about Wet Dog? Yep. Stink it up. You know, I am so romantic sometimes I think I should just marry myself. - Give me a break, Mike. - What a night of romance I got ahead of me. Tonight is about me and Celia. Ooh, the love boat is about to set sail. 'Cause I gotta tell you, buddy, that face of hers, it just makes my heart go... Hello, Wazowski. - Fun-filled evening planned for tonight? - Well, as a matter of fact... Then I'm sure you filed your paperwork correctly for once. Your stunned silence is very reassuring. Oh, no, my scare reports. I left them on my desk. And if I'm not at the restaurant in five minutes, they're gonna give our table away. What am I gonna tell... - Schmoopsie-poo. - Hey, Googley Bear. Want to get going? - Uh, do I ever. It's just that... - What? - You know, it... There's a small... - I don't understand. - It's just that... - I-It's just that I forgot about some paperwork I was supposed to file. Mike was reminding me. Thanks, buddy. I was? I mean, I was. Yeah. I was. - Oh. Okay. Let's go, then. - We're going. On my desk, Sulley. The pink copies go to Accounting, the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing... and the goldenrod ones go to Roz. Leave the puce. Pink copies go to Accounting, the fuchsia ones go to Roz. No, the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing, the goldenrod ones go to Roz... Man, I have no idea what puce is. Oh, that's puce. Uh, hello! Anyone? There's a door here. Hello. Hey. Psst. Anybody scaring in here? Hello. Yo. Kitty! No, no, stay back! Hold it, hold it. Oh, Michael, I've had a lot of birthda... Well, not a lot of birthdays. But this is the best birthday ever. What are you looking at? Oh, I was just thinking about the first time I laid eye on you, how pretty you looked. - Stop it. - Your hair was shorter then. - I'm thinking about getting it cut. - No, no, I-I like it this length. I like everything about you. Just the other day, someone asked me who I thought the most beautiful monster was in all of Monstropolis. - Do you know what I said? - What did you say? - I said... - Sulley? - Sulley? - No! No, no. - That's not what I was gonna say! I mean... - Mike, you're not making sense. - Sure, he's handsome, I mean, for like a big, rugged... - Hi, guys. What a coincidence running into you here. Uh... - I'm just gonna order something to go. - Michael. - Sulley. - Uh, I wonder what's good here. - Get out of here. You're ruining everything. - I went back to get your paperwork, and there was a door. - What? - A door? - Randall was in it. Wait a minute. Randall? That cheater. He's trying to boost his numbers. - There's something else. - What? - What? - Look in the bag. What bag? - They don't have anything I like here! So take care, Celia! - Excuse me, sir. - Michael, what's going on? - Celia, please try to understand. - I have to do something! - Michael! - Oh, that's good. - On three. One, two... - A kid! - Boo! A kid! There's a kid here! A human kid! Googley Bear! Come on! Let's get outta here! Please remain calm. This is not a drill. 78-35 in progress. Please advise. - Michael? Michael! - Celia! - Please come with me. - Stop pushing. - Hey, get your hands off my Schmoopsie-poo! Building clear. Ready for decontamination. Well, I don't think that date could've gone any worse. If witnesses are to be believed, there has been a child security breach... for the first time in monster history. We can neither confirm nor deny the presence of a human child here tonight. Well, a kid flew right over me and blasted a car with its laser vision. I tried to run from it, but it picked me up with its mind powers and shook me like a doll. It's true! I saw the whole thing! It is my professional opinion... that now is the time to panic. Oh, it's coming! It's coming! Boo! Come here, kid! No, don't touch those, you little... Now, those were alphabetized. It's okay. It's all right. As long as it doesn't come near us, we're gonna be okay. Oh, y-you like this? Fetch! Hey, hey, that's it! No one touches little Mikey. Mike, give her the bear. Oh, no. Make it stop, Sulley! Make it stop! Here, look. Here, see the bear? Here. Ooh, nice bear. Sulley! Ooh, bear! Ooh! Ooh, he's a happy bear! And he's not crying, and neither should you, or we'll be in trouble 'cause they're gonna find us. So please stop crying right now. - Good. Good, Sulley. Keep it up. You're doing great. - I'm a happy bear, yeah. - Oh, she touched me! It touched me! - Sulley, the bear! The bear! Give me the... What was that? I have no idea, but it would be really great if it didn't do it again. How could I do this? How could I be so stupid? - This could destroy the company. - The company? Who cares about the company? What about us? That thing is a killing machine! I bet it's just waiting for us to fall asleep, and then wham! Oh, we're easy prey, my friend. Easy prey. We're sitting targets. Okay, look, I think I have a plan here. Using mainly spoons, we dig a tunnel under the city... and release it into the wild. Spoons. That's it. I'm out of ideas. We're closed. Hot air balloon? Too expensive. Giant slingshot? Too conspicuous. Enormous wooden horse? Too Greek. No plan. I can't think. Can't think. Flatlining. - Flatlining. - Uh, Mike, I think she's getting tired. Well, then why don't you find someplace for it to sleep... while I think of a plan! Are you sleepy? You want to sleep? Is that what you want? Okay. All right. I'm making a nice little area for you to... No. Hey, hey. That's my bed. You're gonna get your germs all over it. Fine. My chair's more comfortable anyway. What? It's just a closet. Will you go to sleep? Hey, that looks like Randall. Randall's your monster. You think he's gonna come through the closet and scare you. Oh, boy. How do I explain this? Uh, it's empty. See? No monster in here. Well, now there is, but, uh, l-I'm not gonna scare you. I'm off duty. Okay. How about I sit here until you fall asleep? Go ahead. Uh, go to sleep. Now. Now. Go. Uh, you go... to sleep. Hey, Mike, this might sound crazy, but I don't think that kid's dangerous. Really? Well, in that case let's keep it. - I always wanted a pet that could kill me! - Now, look. - What if we just put her back in her door? - What? Mike, think about it. If we send her back, it's like it never happened. - Everything goes back to normal. - Is that a joke? Tell me you're joking. Sulley, I'd like to think that given the circumstances... I've been extremely forgiving up to now, but that is a horrible idea. What are we gonna do, march right out into public with that thing? Then we just waltz right up to the factory, right? I can't believe we are waltzing right up to the factory. Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights and some chair fabric are not gonna fool anyone. Just think about a few names, will ya? Loch Ness, Bigfoot, the Abominable Snowman. They all got one thing in common, pal: Banishment. - We could be next! - Don't panic. We can do this. - Hey, how you doin', Frank? - Hey, guys. Everything's going to be okay. - Number One wants this place dusted for prints. - Careful with that. - I got a good view from here. - A little lower. This was recovered at the scene. - Don't panic. Don't panic. - Don't tell me not to panic. - Just keep it together. Stay cool. - Everything is not okay. It's not okay. - Boo! - Could be contaminated. - Gentlemen, safety is our number-one concern. - Now, if there's anything that... - Boo. - No, not now, not now, and... Oh, hello, little one. Where did you come from? - Mr Waternoose! - Ah, James, is this one yours? Uh, actually, that's my, uh, cousin's sister's, uh, daughter, sir. Yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh, Bring An Obscure Relative To Work Day. Must've missed the memo. Well, listen, James, why don't you stop by the simulator after lunch today... and give us that scare demonstration we talked about, huh? - Yeah... Oh! Oh, sir, uh, today might be... - Excuse me, Mr Waternoose. Yes, yes, I'm coming. All right, then. I'll see you this afternoon, James. That is, if these gentlemen haven't shut us down. - Oh, boy. - Oh, a scare demo. Well, that is great. Why am I the last to know? We can bring your cousin's sister's daughter along. She'll be a big hit. Halt! Stop him! Hold him down. Come on. The coast is clear. Okay, all we have to do is get rid of that thing. So wait here while I get its card key. But she can't stay here. This is the men's room. That is the weirdest thing you have ever said. It's fine. It's okay. Look, it loves it here. It's dancing with joy. I'll be right back with its door key. That's a cute little dance you've got. That almost looks like you gotta... Uh, are you done in there? Sorry. Sorry. Okay, you finished now, right? Hello. Boo! Where did she go? Did she disappear? Did she turn invisible? I just have no idea. - Gotcha! - Boo! Hey, you're good. Be relaxed, be relaxed, be relaxed. Roz, my tender, oozing blossom, you're looking fabulous today. Is that a new haircut? Come on, tell me. It's a new haircut, isn't it? It's got to be a new haircut. New make-up. You've had a lift, you've had a tuck, you've had something. Something has been inserted in your skin that makes you look like... Listen, I need a favour. Randall was working late last night out on the scare floor. I really need the key for the door he was using. Well, isn't that nice? But guess what. You didn't turn in your paperwork last night. - He didn't... I... No p-paperwork? - This office is now closed. Ready or not, here I come. I'm getting warmer. Any second now. Fee, fi, fo... - What are you doing? - I-I'm-I'm looking for the kid. - You lost it? - No, no. She was just, uh... Here she is... Hey, what's the matter? - Look, I already told your buddies I haven't seen anything. - All right. Carry on. Randall, thank goodness! What are we gonna do about the child? Will you... shh! The front page! It's on the front page. The child, the one you were after! Will you be quiet? Don't you think I'm aware of the situation? I was up all night trying to find it. I-I did a simple calculation, factoring in the size of the sushi restaurant. The child may have escaped! Yeah, well, until we know for sure, we're gonna act like nothing happened, understand? You just get the machine up and running. I'll take care of the kid. And when I find whoever let it out, they're dead! - Why are you still here? Come on, go! Move! Now! - Oh. Yes, go, go, go! Now, now, now, now! I'm not here! They're gone. This is bad. This is so very bad. - What were they talking about, a machine? - Who cares? Look, don't panic. All we have to do is call her door down and send her home. You're right. You're right. We're just two regular Joes on our way to work. We will blend right in. - Top of the mornin', fellas. - Hey, what's shakin', bacon? Did you lose weight? Or a limb? - You have her card key, right? - Of course I have her card key. I told you I'd get her card key. I went and got her card key, and now I have her card key. Okay, here we go. Take care of yourself. Try not to run through any more closets. - Mike, that's not her door. - What are you talking about? Of course it's her door. It's her door. - No, her door was white. - No. - And it had flowers on it. No. It must have been dark last night, because this is its door. Hey, you hear that? Sounds like fun in there. Okay, send me a postcard, kid. That's Mike Wazowski, care of 22 ""Mike Wazowski, You Got Your Life Back"" Lane. Very good. Now, bon voyage. Bye-bye! Come on! Look at the stick. See the stick? Go get the stick. Go fetch. - Mike, this isn't Boo's door. - Boo? What's Boo? That's what I decided to call her. Is there a problem? Sulley, you're not supposed to name it. Once you name it, you start getting attached to it. Now, put that thing back where it came from, or so help me... Oh, hey, we're rehearsing a-a scene for the upcoming company play called, uh... Put That Thing Back Where It Came From, Or So Help Me. It's a musical. Yeah. Put that thing back where it came from or so help me So help me, so help me And cut! We're still working on it. It's a work in progress, but, hey, we need ushers. Sulley, I've had enough. Now say goodbye to... - Where'd it go? What'd you do with it? - Where is she? - I don't believe it. She got away from you again? - Boo! Well, that is just... Wait a minute. The sun is coming up. This is perfect. She's gone! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Where you going? Sulley, please. Don't blow this, not when we're so close to breaking the record! Come on, somebody else will find the kid. It'll be their problem, not ours. She's out of our hair! - What are you two doing? - They're rehearsing a play. - She's out of our hair - Can it, Wazowski. So what do you think of that kid getting out, Sullivan? Pretty crazy, huh? Oh, yeah. Crazy. Word on the street is the kid's been traced back to this factory. - You haven't seen anything, have you? - Uh, well, uh... No. No way. But if it was an inside job, uh, I-I'd put my money on Waxford. - Waxford? - Yeah, the one on station six. You know, he's got them shifty eyes. - Hey, Waxford! - Sulley! Michael Wazowski! Last night was one of the worst nights of my entire life, bar none. - I thought you cared about me. - Honey, please, Schmoopsie. - I thought you liked sushi. - Sushi? Sushi? - You think this is about sushi? - Schmoopsie! - Wazowski! - Michael! Mi... Men! Breathe. Keep breathing. - Where's the kid? - Kid? What kid? - It's here in the factory, isn't it? - You're not pinning this on me. It never would've gotten out if you hadn't been cheating last night. Cheating? Cheating. Right. Okay, I think I know how to make this all go away. What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes? - Uh, I get a timeout? - Everyone goes to lunch. Which means the scare floor will be... - Painted? - Empty! It'll be empty, you idiot! You see that clock? When the big hand is pointing up and the little hand is pointing up... the kid's door will be in my station. But when the big hand points down... the door will be gone. You have until then to put the kid back. Get the picture? Boo! No! - Hey, you! Halt! He's the one. - Uh... - The one from the commercial. - Affirmative. That's him. - Can we get an autograph? - Ohh! Oh, sure. No problem. If you could make that out to Stephanie, my daughter. Yes. Let's see. From your scary friend, best wishes. So I said, ""If you talk to me like that again, we're through!"" - What'd she say? - You know my mom. She sent me to my room. - See you guys later. Take it easy. - Thanks a lot. - Bottoms up. Boo! Hey. Oh! Well, hello there. What's your name? Mike Wazowski! Sulley! Oh! Sulley. Okay, Sulley, come on, come on. - Hey, you guys seen Sulley anywhere? - Nope. Sorry. - Oh, Sulley! - Boy, Wazowski looks like he's in trouble. - 23-19! We have a 23-19! - Halt! - Oh, dear. - Get him! Sulley! Sulley! Sulley! Oh! Great news, pal! I got us a way out of this mess, but we gotta hurry. Where is it? Sull, that's a cube of garbage. I-I can still hear her little voice. - Mike Wazowski! - Hey, I can hear her too. - Mike Wazowski! - Mike Wazowski! - How many kids you got in there? - Mike Wazowski! - Mike Wazowski! - Kitty! - Boo! Boo, are you all right? I was so worried! I was... Don't you ever run away from me again, young lady. Oh, but I'm so glad you're safe. Oh, my, what an affectionate father. Uh, actually, she's my, uh, my cousin's sister's... - Okay, Sulley, that's enough. Let's go. - Mike Wazowski! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Step aside, kid. We're in a... - Will you stop making Boo laugh! - I didn't! Come on! - I still don't understand. You got Boo's door? - I'll explain later. Run. Okay, let's move, let's move, let's move. Come on. Oh, please be there, please be there, please be there. - There it is, just like Randall said. - Randall? Wait a minute. Whoa. Hey. 1-2-3-4, get the kid back through the door. - Hey. Hey. - We're gonna get our lives back. The nightmare is over! - Hey, it's okay, Boo. - Hey, what's the matter? Come on, it's time to move! Mike, what are you thinking? We can't trust Randall. He's after Boo. - Who cares? Let's go. This is a limited-time offer. - No, no. I don't like this. Look, Sulley, you wanted her door, and there it is. Now let's move. - No, Mike. - You want me to prove everything's on the up-and-up? Fine. - He wants the door, I get the door. He don't want the door. - Mike, wait. He's a paranoid, delusional fur ball. Mike! Hey, Sulley, where you been all day? Sulley? Sulley? Huh? Mike. Mike. Where are you? Are you in there? Where are you, buddy? Mike, where are you? Boo, way to go! It's okay. Oh, Randall, did you take care of that situation? Yeah, of course I did. Let's get going. We gotta make up for lost time. - You got the extra scream cans? - Uh, right. - So to confirm, then, you did find the... - Yes, I got the kid! Oh, huzzah! That's great news! - Not that I was concerned, of course. I knew that... - Just get over here and help me. Come on, come on, come on, come on. While we're young here, Fungus. Kid needs to take off a few pounds. Wazowski! Where is it, you little one-eyed cretin? Okay, first of all, it's cretin. If you're gonna threaten me, do it properly. Second of all, you're nuts if you think kidnapping me is gonna help you cheat your way to the top. You still think this is about that stupid scare record? Well, I did, right up until you chuckled like that. And, uh, now I'm thinkin' I should just get out of here. I am about to revolutionize the scaring industry, and when I do... even the great James P. Sullivan is gonna be working for me. Well, somebody's certainly been a busy bee. First I need to know where the kid is, and you're gonna tell me. - Yeah, I don't know anything. - Uh-huh. Sure. I-I don't. I mean, I don't. Uh-oh. What's that? Wait. Come on, wait, wait, wait, wait. Uh-oh. Uh-oh! Oh, come on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey! This thing is moving. I don't like big moving things that are moving towards me. No, come on. Hey! Randall! Say hello to the Scream Extractor. Hello. Come on. Where you going? We-We'll talk. Come on, we'll have a latte. Come on! We can talk about this. What's that thing? What is that thing? Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no! Oh! No, come on, guys! Help! Help! Help! Help! Oh, for... What did you do wrong this time? - I-I don't know. I calibrated the drive... - Go check the machine! Th-There must be something wrong with the scream intake valve. Yeah, th-that's the problem with these 32-50 units, boss. See, the old intake valve is always the first thing to go. I-I told them this. Psst. Fungus. Fungus. You like cars, huh? 'Cause I got a really nice car. You let me go, I'll give you a ride in the car. - Please, Fungus? - I'm sorry, Wazowski. But Randall said I'm not allowed to fraternize with victims of his evil plot. What happened? Where's Wazowski? Where is he? - Come on. - This is crazy. He's gonna kill us. - Careful with that. Could be contaminated. - We gotta get out of here now! We can start a whole new life somewhere far away. Goodbye, Monsters, Inc. Goodbye, Mr Waternoose. - No, Mike. Wait. - Hey, what are you doin'? - Follow me. I have an idea. - No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. - Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated. - No, no, no, no, no. What was that? You're trying to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep. I was going for a snake-slash-ninja approach with a little hissing. Oh, how many times do I have to tell you? It's all about presence, about how you enter the room. - Mr Waternoose! - James. Perfect timing. - No, no, no, sir, you don't understand. - Ah, now, show these monsters how it's done. - What? No, no. I ca... I ca... Sir. Sir! - You have to listen to me. - Pay attention, everyone. - You're about to see the best in the business. - Sir, I c... - Reset the simulator. - But, but, sir... - Good night, sweetheart. - Good night, Mom. - Sleep tight, kiddo. - Kitty! - No, Boo. No, no! - Now, give us a big, loud roar. - Mr Waternoose, there's no time for this. - Come on, come on. What are you waiting for? Roar! - B-B-But, sir... - Roar! - Ohh. - Well done. Well done, James. - Boo? - All right, gentlemen. - Right this way, everyone. - I hope you've learned a valuable lesson in scaring today. Boo? Boo? Boo, it's me. - The child! - Sir, she isn't toxic. - What? - I know it sounds crazy, but trust me. - Sulley... - Boo? No, no, no, no, it's okay. I was just... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, don't be scared. That wasn't real. It's just a... I was just... - Boo. - And he was gonna test it out on that sweet little girl. - Boo? - Now that we have her, he is trying to kill us. - This whole thing is Randall's fault. - Randall? Yes, and we can take you to his secret lab which is right here in this factory. How could this happen? How could this happen? - Does anyone else know about this? - No, sir. Good. This company can't afford any more bad publicity. Now, before we do anything else... let's take care of the child. Oh, I never thought things would come to this. Not in my factory. I'm sorry you boys got mixed up in this, especially you, James. But now we can set everything straight again for the good of the company. - Uh, sir, that's not her door. - I know, I know. It's yours. No! Boo! No. No. No, no, no, no, no! It's too late! We're banished, genius. We're in the human world! Oh, what a great idea, going to your old pal Waternoose. Too bad he was in on the whole thing! All you had to do was listen to me, just once! But you didn't, did you? You're still not listening! Take that! Welcome to the Himalayas! Abominable! Can you believe that? Do I look abominable to you? Why can't they call me the Adorable Snowman or, or the Agreeable Snowman, for crying out loud? I'm a nice guy. Snow cone? No, no, no, don't worry. It's lemon. Uh, how 'bout you, big fella? Snow cone? Did you see the way she looked at me? Ah, poor guy. I understand. It ain't easy being banished. Uh, take my buddy Bigfoot. When he was banished, he fashioned an enormous diaper out of poison ivy. Wore it on his head like a tiara. Called himself King Itchy. It won't be so hard for you guys though, you know. I mean, how lucky can you get? - Banished with your best friend. - He is not my friend. Oh. I-I just assumed you were buddies, you know, when I saw you out there in the snow hugging and all, I... Look at that big jerk. Ruined my life, and for what? A stupid kid! Because of you, I am now stuck in this frozen wasteland! Wasteland? I think you mean wonderland. I mean, how about all this fabulous snow, huh? Oh, and wait till you see the local village. Cutest thing in the world. I haven't even mentioned all the free yak's milk. - Wait. What did you say? - Uh, yak's milk. Milking a yak ain't exactly a picnic... but, you know, once you pick the hairs out, it's very nutritious. No, no, something about a village. Where? Are there kids in it? Kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids, kids who climb on rocks. - Where is it? - Ah, hey, hey! It's at the bottom of the mountain. - Around a three-day hike. - Oh! Three days? We need to get there now! You want to go to the village? Okay, rule number one out here. Always... No. Never go out in a blizzard. We need to get to Boo. Boo? What about us? Ever since that kid came in, you've ignored everything I've said. And now look where we are! Oh, we were about to break the record, Sulley. - We would have had it made. - None of that matters now. None of it matters? W-W-Wait a second. None of it matters? Okay, that's, uh... No. Good. Great. So now the truth comes out, doesn't it? Oh, would you look at that? We're out of snow cones. Uh, let me just go outside and make some more. Sulley, what about everything we ever worked for? Does that matter, huh? What about Celia? I am never... never gonna see her again. Doesn't that matter? And what about me? I'm your pal. I'm-I'm-I'm your best friend. Don't I matter? I'm sorry, Mike. I'm sorry we're stuck out here. I didn't mean for this to happen. But Boo's in trouble. I think there might be a way to save her if we can just get down to that... We? Whoa, whoa, whoa. We? No, there's no ""we"" this time, pal. I-If-If-If you want to go out there and freeze to death... you be my guest... because you're on your own. Hey, I got more snow cones! Oh, come on now, George. I know you can do this. I picked out an easy door for you in Nepal. Nice, quiet Nepal. You know, you're right. Here, take this. - Go get 'em, Georgie! - Gangway! Look out! Comin' through! - Sorry, George. - What the... - Hey, you can't just... Twenty-three-nine... - Out of the way! - Hey! Help! Finally. I never should have trusted you with this. Because of you, I had to banish my top scarer. Ah, with this machine, we won't need scarers. Besides, Sullivan got what he deserved. Sullivan was twice the scarer you will ever be. Kitty! - Kitty! - Sullivan? - Kitty! - Sorry, Boo. Stop him! Let's get you home. Finish him off! You don't know how long I've wanted to do that, Sullivan! - Mike? - Look, it's not that I don't care about the kid. - Mike, you don't understand. - Yes, I do. I was just mad, that's all. I needed some time to think. But you shouldn't have left me out there. - I'm being attacked. - No, I'm not attacking you. I-I-I'm trying to be honest. Just hear me out. Look, you and I are a team. Nothing is more important than our friendship. I-I-I know, kid. He-He's too sensitive. Come on, pal, if you start crying I'm gonna cry and I'll never get through this. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, but I am now. Hey, Sulley, I am baring my soul here. The least you could do is pay attention. Hey, look at that. It's Randall. It's... - Oh. - Come on! - Get up! There can't be any witnesses. - There won't be. - I'm glad you came back, Mike. - Somebody's gotta take care you, you big hair ball. - Schmoopsie-poo, I really can't talk. - Come on! Michael, if you don't tell me what's going on right now, we are through! - Do you hear me? Through! - Okay, here's the truth. You know the kid that they're looking for? Sulley let her in. We tried to send her back, but Waternoose had this secret plot... and now Randall's right behind us, and he's trying to kill us. You expect me to believe that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski? Mike Wazowski! - I love you, Schmoopsie-poo! - Will you move it? Hey! Look out. Idiot! - Look out. Coming through here. Coming through. - Excuse me. Sorry. - Make way. Move it! Hurry up. Hurry up. - There they are! - Attention, employees. Randall Boggs has just broken the all-time scare record. Huh? No, I didn't. Get out of my way! Let me go! Go get 'em, Googley Bear. - There it is! - Get off my tail. Let me go! - Sulley, what are you doing? - Grab on, Mike. - Are you out of your mind? - Sulley, what are we doing? - We have to get Boo's door and find a station. What a plan. Simple, yet insane! - Whoa. - Oh, boy. - Hold on! - Wow! - Don't look down! I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna be sick. Oh, no! No! - Boo's door! - There it is! How are we supposed to get to it now? Oh, it's a dead end, Sulley. There he is. - Make her laugh! - What? Sulley! - Just do it! Ow! - Get it open! - Here he comes. Give me that kid! - Why couldn't we get banished here? - Come on. We gotta find another door. Look! Boo's door! - There he is. Hurry up! Hurry up! - Give me your hand. - Come on. It slides, it slides. - Ooh, right, right, right. Jump! I'm right behind you. Come on! - Hurry up! Keep moving! - Get inside! That was weird. Mike? Ooh, sorry, buddy. I hope that hurt, lizard boy. Great job, buddy. We lost him. Boo! Nice workin' with ya! - Get it open! - I'm trying! - Open the door! - Come on! Get in here! Boo! There they are! Sulley, what are you doing? Sulley! - Looks like we caught the express, pal! - Do you see 'em? Straight ahead! - Kitty! - Boo! Look at everybody's favourite scarer now! You stupid, pathetic waste! You've been number one for too long, Sullivan. Now your time is up! And don't worry, I'll take good care of the kid. No! She's not scared of you any more. Looks like you're out of a job. All right. Come on. Over the plate. Let's see the old stuff here, pal. Come on, now. Chuck 'im. Chuck 'im, baby. - Hey, please, don't! Don't! - Hum, baby, hum, baby. Here's the pitch. And he is out of here! Mama, another gator got in the house. Another gator? Give me that shovel! Come here! Get it, Ma! Get that gator! - Care to do the honours, Mikey? - With pleasure. That's right, Boo. You did it! You beat him. Come on. Okay, Boo, it's time to go home. Take care of yourself and be a good girl, okay? - Oh, no! - The power's out. Make her laugh again. All right. I got a move here. It'll bring down the house. - Oh, sorry. She didn't see that. - What? What'd you do, forget to check if her stupid hood was up? You big dope! Uncle Mike, try not to yell in front of her. - You know we still need her to laugh. - Right. Hey, Boo! Just kidding. Look! Funny, right, huh? See, with the... These are the jokes, kid. - What's happening? - Hold on! When the door lands in the station, cut the power. You'll have the child and the criminals responsible for this whole mess. Great. A welcoming committee. What are we gonna do? This is the CD A. Come out slowly with the child in plain sight. Okay. Okay. You got us. Here we are. Here's the kid. I'm cooperating. But before you take us away, I have one thing to say. - Catch! - We have a toxic projectile. Isolate the contaminate. - Halt! - After the suspect! - Clear the area! - Stop him! - Come on. - Don't let them get away. What? Wait, wait! Come back! He has the child! Sullivan? Sullivan! Give me the child! Give her to me! Open this door! Open this door! Sullivan! Don't do it. - Come on. - Don't go in that room! I think we stopped him, Boo. You're safe now. You be a good girl, okay? This has gone far enough, James. - She's home now. Just leave her alone. - I can't do that! She's seen too much. You both have. - It doesn't have to be this way. - I have no choice! - Times have changed. Scaring isn't enough any more. - But kidnapping children? I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die! And I'll silence anyone who gets in my way! - No! - Good night, Mom. - Good night, sweetheart. - What? What? Wh-Wh-What is this? - Good night, Mom. Good night, Mom. Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated. Well, I don't know about the rest of you guys... but I spotted several big mistakes. - But... But... But h-how did... h-how did... - You know what? Let's watch my favourite part again, shall we? I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die! - What? What? - I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die! I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die! - I'll get him. All right, come with us. - Wh-What are you doing? Take your hands off me. You can't arrest me. I hope you're happy, Sullivan. You've destroyed this company. Monsters, Incorporated is dead! Where will everyone get their scream now? The energy crisis will only get worse because of you! Stay where you are. Number One wants to talk to you. Attention! - Hello, boys. - Roz? Two and a half years of undercover work were almost wasted... when you intercepted that child, Mr Sullivan. Of course, without your help, I never would have known... that this went all the way up to Waternoose. Now, about the girl. I just want to send her home. Very good. Bring me a door shredder. What? You mean... You mean I can't see her again? That's the way it has to be. I'll give you five minutes. - Well, so long, kid. - Mike Wazowski! Yeah. Aw, Boo. It's been fun. Go ahead. Go grow up. Uh, B-Boo... Um, Boo? Oh, look at that. Yeah, you know... Oh, that's cute, yeah. Uh, Boo, um... - Well, that's very nice. - Kitty. Come here, you. Oh, he's a happy bear Nothing's coming out of your closet to scare you any more, right? Yeah. Goodbye, Boo. Kitty. Kitty has to go. Boo! Kitty? None of this ever happened, gentlemen. And I don't want to see any paperwork on this. Take him away. I bet we get the rest of the day off. You idiot! They're gonna shut down the factory! I'm tellin' you, pal, when that wall went up, you should have seen the look on Waternoose's face. I hope we get a copy of that tape. Hey, you all right? Come on, pal. Cheer up. We did it. We got Boo home. Oh, sure, we put the factory in the toilet and, gee, hundreds of people will be out of work now. Not to mention the angry mob that'll come after us when there's no more power. But hey, at least we had some laughs, right? Laughs. Hey, is this thing on? Hello! Hello! Testing! Testing! Hey, good evening. How are you? How are you? Nice to see you. I tell ya, it's great to be here in your room. Where you from? Never mind. You're in kindergarten, right? Oh, I love kindergarten. Best three years of my life. Of my life. But I love sports. Dodge ball was the best. Oh, yeah. I was the fastest one out there. Of course, I was the ball. But I... I was the ball, see? All right. Hey, thanks a lot. I'll be here all week. Remember to tip your waitresses. Great job, Mikey. You filled your quota on the first kid of the day. Not bad, huh? You know, only somebody with perfect comedic timing... could produce this much energy in one shot. Uh-huh. And the fact that laughter is ten times more powerful than scream had nothing to do with it. Oh, Googley Bear. Come here, you. - Schmoopsie-poo! - Googley. Girls. Girls. Quit. Stop, stop, stop. Michael, you're such a charmer. - Hey, did you bring the magazine? - They just delivered a whole box. Let me see it! Sulley and I made the cover, right? - I don't believe it. - Googley Bear. I'm on the cover of a magazine! Oh, this is great! - Hey, Sulley! - Hey, uh, Mike. I was, uh, just... - Listen, if you got a minute, there's something I wanna show you. Okay? - B-B-But... - Close your eyes. Follow me. - I-I-I... - Come on. No peeking. - Keep coming, keep coming, keep coming. Come on. Keep coming, keep coming. - Mike! And follow the sultry sound of my voice. Okay, stop. Open 'em. - Ta-da! - Mike! - Is that... - Sorry it took so long, pal. It was a lot of wood to go through. You know, it only works if you have every piece. Boo? Kitty! Speed. Marker. And action. If I were a rich man With a million or two I'd live in a penthouse In a room with a view - And if I were handsome - No way! - It could happen. 'Cause dreams do come true. Roll slate. I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you Wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have Wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have Wouldn't have nothin' Okay, cut. Okay, you're finished now, right? - Hello. - Hello. Come on, get lost, you two. You're making him lose his focus. - Oh, sorry. - See you later, fellas. - Go get 'em, Mr Solomon. - You idiot! It's Sullivan, not Solomon. - What? - You're messing up the scene. - Sorry. - We're never gonna work in Hollywood again. - Let me do it over. - Shut up! - Keep rolling! - You're making it worse! Duck and cover, people! Hey, thanks, guys. That was a close one. Ta-da! Aw, Boo, it's been fun. Go ahead. Go throw up. - What? Wh-Wh... What did I say? What? What? - Cut. Hey, Ted, good morning! - Cut. - Hey, how was that? Was I scary? - Do I get the part? - Thank you. - Can I do it again? - I can be taller. - Next. And action. Okay, let's move, let's move, let's move. Come on! Can we get a little more wax on the floor, please? Wait a minute. Randall? That cheater. - He's trying to boost his numbers. - There's something else. - What? - Look-lay in the bag-bay. - I think you mean ook-lay in the ag-bay. - What? Didn't I, uh... Well, you know, maybe you should just take a minute and ead-ray your ipt-scray. You think he's gonna come through the closet and scare you. Oh, boy. How do I explain this? Uh, it's empty. See? Guess who! Hey, what's the... Okay, very funny. Hey, I look good in a suit. Marker. Let her rip! Go! Shut it off! Shut it off! Shut it off! You're making it worse! But I must admit it Big guy, you always come through I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you You and me together That's how it always should be One without the other Don't mean nothin'to me Nothin'to me Oh, hey! We're rehearsing a, a scene... for the upcoming company play called... Put That Thing Back Where It Came From, Or So Help Me. It's a musical. Yeah. Put that thing back where it came from Or so help me Get that thing away from me you guys Put that thing back where it came from or I'll poke myself in the eye It's, uh, i-it's a work in progress. I-It's gonna get better. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this year's company play... starring, written and directed by Mike... - And produced. - And produced by Mike Wazowski. Put that thing back where it came from or so help me So help me So help me get by Put that thing back where it came from or so help me So help me I just gotta cry Your seat is right over there, sir. - Boo! - There's a child, there's a child There's a human child - Oh, no! - Running around the restaurant This is really wrong What in heaven's name will become of us We who are living in Monstropolis All right, Wazowski, tell us where the kid is. Boo! I will never talk. Never! She's out of our hair And just when I dare to care She says, au contraire You're my pair of friends I love you Keep it together, man. And so we put that kid back Where she came from And she helped us to find A better tomorrow Today Thank you! What a night for my mother to be in the audience, ladies and gentlemen. My mom! Thank you, Monstropolis! - I don't have to say it - Aw, say it anyway. 'Cause we both know it's true I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you Wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have You One more time! It worked! - Don't have to say it - I'm gonna anyway! - 'Cause we both know it's true - Let's take it home, big guy! I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have - You - You! You! - A-E-l-O - That means you. Yeah!, Men are haunted by the vastness of eternity. And so we ask ourselves... ... will our actions echo across the centuries? Will strangers hear our names long after we're gone... ...and wonder who we were... ...how bravely we fought... ...how fiercely we loved? Good day for the crows. Remove your army from my land. I like your land. I think we'll stay. I like your soldiers too. They won't fight for you. That's what the Messenians said. And the Arcadians and the Epeians. Now they all fight for me. You can't have the whole world, Agamemnon. It's too big, even for you. I don't want to watch another massacre. Let's settle this war in the old manner. Your best fighter against my best. And if my man wins? We'll leave Thessaly for good. Boagrius! Achilles! Boagrius has this effect on many heroes. Careful who you insult, old king. My king, Achilles is not with the army. -Where is he? -I sent a boy to look for him. I was having a good dream. Very good dream. King Agamemnon sent me. He needs to-- I'll speak to your king in the morning. But my lord, it is morning. They're waiting for you. Are the stories about you true? They say your mother is an immortal goddess. They say you can't be killed. I wouldn't be bothering with the shield then, would I? The Thessalonian you're fighting. . . . . .he's the biggest man I've ever seen. I wouldn't want to fight him. That's why no one will remember your name. Perhaps we should have our war tomorrow, when you're better rested. I should have you whipped for your impudence! Perhaps you should fight him. Achilles. Achilles. Look at the men's faces. You can save hundreds of them. You can end this war with a swing of your sword. Let them go home to their wives. Imagine a king who fights his own battles. Wouldn't that be a sight. Of all the warlords loved by the gods, I hate him the most. Is there no one else? Is there no one else? Who are you, soldier? Achilles. Son of Peleus. Achilles? I'll remember the name. The ruler of Thessaly carries this scepter. Give it to your king. He's not my king. Brothers in arms! -Friendship! -Friendship! Princes of Troy, on our last night together. . . . . .Queen Helen and I salute you. We've had our conflicts before, it's true. We fought many battles, Sparta and Troy. And fought well! But I have always respected your father. Priam is a good king, a good man. I respected him as an adversary. I respect him now as my ally. Hector, Paris, young princes, come. Stand. Drink with me. Let us drink to peace. To peace between Troy and Sparta. May the gods keep the wolves in the hills and the women in our beds. -For the gods. -For the gods. You shouldn't be here. That's what you said last night. Last night was a mistake. And the night before? I've made many mistakes this week. Do you want me to go? Pearls from the Sea of Propontis. They're beautiful. But I can't wear them. Menelaus would kill us both. Don't be afraid of him. I'm not afraid of dying. I'm afraid of tomorrow. I'm afraid of watching you sail away and knowing you'll never come back. Before you came to Sparta, I was a ghost. I walked, and I ate, and I swam in the sea. . . . . .but I was just a ghost. You don't have to fear tomorrow. Come with me. Don't play with me. Don't play. If you come, we'll never be safe. Men will hunt us, the gods will curse us. But I'll love you. Till the day they burn my body. . . . . .I will love you. A beautiful morning. Poseidon has blessed our voyage. Sometimes the gods bless you in the morning and curse you in the afternoon. Drop sail! Do you love me, brother? Would you protect me against any enemy? The last time you spoke to me like this. . . . . .you were 10 years old, and you'd just stolen Father's horse. What have you done now? I must show you something. Where is she? I swear by the father of the gods, I will gut you here if you don't tell me! My king! She left. With the Trojans. The fisherman here saw her board their ship. The Trojans? With the young prince, Paris. She. . . . Get my ship ready. Turn us round. Back to Sparta. High on the sail! -Wait, wait. -You fool! -Listen to me. -Do you know what you've done? Do you know how many years our father worked for peace? I love her. It's all a game to you, isn't it? You roam from town to town, bedding merchants' wives and temple maids. You think you know something about love. What about your father's love? You spat on him when you brought her on this ship! What about the love for your country? You'd let Troy burn for this woman? I won't let you start a war for her. May I speak? What you're saying is true. I've wronged you. I've wronged our father. If you want to take Helen back to Sparta, so be it. But I go with her. To Sparta? They'll kill you. Then I'll die fighting. Oh, and that sounds heroic to you, doesn't it? To die fighting. -Little brother, have you ever killed a man? -No. -Ever seen a man die in combat? -No. I've killed men, and I've heard them dying. And I've watched them dying. And there's nothing glorious about it. Nothing poetic. You say you want to die for love. You know nothing about dying. And you know nothing about love! All the same, I go with her. I won't ask you to fight my war. You already have. To Troy! About ship! Set sail! -I want her back. -Well, of course you do. She's a beautiful woman. I want her back so I can kill her with my own two hands. I won't rest till I've burned Troy to the ground. I thought you wanted peace with Troy. I should have listened to you. Peace is for the women. . . . . .and the weak. Empires are forged by war. All my life, I've stood by your side, fought your enemies. You're the elder, you reap the glory. This is the way of the world. But have I ever complained? Have I ever asked you for anything? Never. You're a man of honor. Will you go to war with me, brother? I always thought my brother's wife was a foolish woman. . . . . .but she's proved to be very useful. The Trojans have never been conquered. Some say they can't be conquered. Old King Priam thinks he's untouchable behind his high walls. He thinks the sun god will protect him. But the gods protect only. . . . . .the strong! If Troy falls. . . . . .I control the Aegean. Hector commands the finest army in the east. I'll attack them with the greatest force the world has ever seen. I want all the kings of Greece and their armies. Send emissaries in the morning. One last thing. We need Achilles and his Myrmidons. Achilles. He can't be controlled. He's as likely to fight us as the Trojans. We don't need to control him, we need to unleash him. That man was born to end lives. Yes, he's a gifted killer. But he threatens everything I've built. Before me, Greece was nothing. I brought all the Greek kingdoms together. I created a nation out of fire worshipers and snake eaters! I build the future, Nestor. Me! Achilles is the past. A man who fights for no flag. A man loyal to no country. How many battles have we won off the edge of his sword? This will be the greatest war the world has ever seen. We need the greatest warrior. There's only one man he'll listen to. Never hesitate. Nervous? Petrified. You told me never to change sword hands. Yes. When you know how to use it, you won't be taking my orders. Your reputation for hospitality is fast becoming legend. Patroclus, my cousin. Odysseus, king of lthaca. Patroclus. I knew your parents well. I miss them. Now you have this one watching over you, eh? Learning from Achilles himself. Kings would kill for the honor. Are you here at Agamemnon's bidding? We need to talk. I will not fight for him. I'm not asking you to fight for him. I'm asking you to fight for the Greeks. Are the Greeks tired of fighting each other? -For now. -The Trojans never harmed me. They insulted Greece. They insulted a man who couldn't hold on to his wife. Is that my business? Your business is war, my friend. Is it? The man has no honor. Let Achilles fight for honor. Let Agamemnon fight for power. And let the gods decide which man to glorify. -For the Greeks! -Forget Agamemnon. Fight for me. My wife will feel much better if she knows you're by my side. I'll feel much better. We're sending the largest fleet that ever sailed. A thousand ships. Prince Hector. Is he as good a warrior as they say? The best of all the Trojans. Some say he's better than all the Greeks too. Even if your cousin doesn't come. . . . . .I hope you'll join us. We could use a strong arm like yours. Play your tricks on me, but not my cousin. You have your swords. I have my tricks. We play with the toys the gods give us. We sail for Troy in three days. This war will never be forgotten. Nor will the heroes who fight in it. I knew they would come for you. Long before you were born. . . . . .I knew they would come. They want you to fight in Troy. I'm making you another seashell necklace. Like the ones I made you when you were a boy. Do you remember? Mother. . . . . .tonight, I decide. If you stay in Lrisa. . . . . .you will find peace. You will find a wonderful woman. You will have sons and daughters, and they will have children. And they will love you. When you are gone, they will remember you. But when your children are dead and their children after them. . . . . .your name will be lost. If you go to Troy. . . . . .glory will be yours. They will write stories about your victories for thousands of years. The world will remember your name. But if you go to Troy. . . . . .you will never come home. For your glory walks hand in hand with your doom. And I shall never see you again. -My son. -Father. Paris. Father. -This is Helen. -Helen? Helen of Sparta? Helen of Troy. I've heard rumors of your beauty. For once. . . . . .the gossips were right. Welcome. Come, you must be tired. Look. He's grown. He is strong. -Briseis! -Paris! Beloved cousin, your beauty grows with each new moon. Briseis. A servant of Apollo now. The young men of Troy were devastated when Briseis chose the virgin robes. Father. . . . . .I know this is the last thing we need. It is the will of the gods. Everything is in their hands. -But I'm surprised you let him bring her. -lf I'd let him fight Menelaus for her. . . . . .you'd be burning a son's body, not welcoming a daughter. We could send peace envoys to Menelaus. You know Menelaus. He'd spear their heads to his gate. What would you have me do? Put her on a ship and send her home. Women have always loved Paris, and he has loved them back. But this is different. Something has changed in him. If we send her home to Menelaus, he will follow her. This is my country, and these are my countrymen. I don't want to see them suffer so my brother can have his prize. It's not just the Spartans coming after her. By now, Menelaus has gone to Agamemnon. And Agamemnon has wanted to destroy us for years. Enemies have been attacking us for centuries. Our walls still stand. Father, we can't win this war. Apollo watches over us. Even Agamemnon is no match for the gods. And how many battalions does the sun god command? Do not mock the gods. They're coming for me. The wind is bringing them closer. What if we left? Tonight. Right now. What if we went down to the stables, took two horses and left? Ride east, keep riding. -And go where? -Away from here. I could hunt deer, rabbit. I could feed us. But this is your home. You left your home for me. Sparta was never my home. My parents sent my there when I was 16 to marry Menelaus. But it was never my home. We'll live off the land. No more palaces for us. No more servants. We don't need any of that. And your family? We'd be protecting my family. If we're not here, what's the need for war? Menelaus won't give up. He'll track us to the end of the world. He doesn't know these lands. I do. We can lose ourselves in a day. You don't know Menelaus. You don't know his brother. They'll burn every house in Troy to find us. They'll never believe we've left. And even if they do, they'll burn it for spite. Then I'll make it easy for him to find me. I'll walk right up to him and tell him you're mine. You're very young, my love. Look at that. Take up your positions! My lord? Should we wait for the others? -They brought us here for war. -Yes, but Agamemnon's orders-- You fight for me, Eudorus, or Agamemnon? For you, my lord. Then fight for me. And let the servants of Agamemnon fight for him. Black sail. It's Achilles. What's the fool doing? He's going to take the beach of Troy with 50 men? Make way there! Make way! Tecton, is the Apollonian Guard ready? -Waiting at the city gates. -Good. I'll be right there. Lysander, how long before the army is ready? Half of our men are still coming. We have to arm them-- -How long? -Noon. Make it sooner. Patroclus! Put down your spear. -I'm fighting the Trojans. -Not today. I'm ready. You taught me how to fight. And you're a good student. But you're not a Myrmidon yet. Look at these men. They are the fiercest soldiers in all of Greece. Each of them has bled for me. -Guard the ship. -But this is a war. Cousin, I can't fight the Trojans if I'm concerned for you. Guard the ship. Trojans! All my life, I've lived by a code. And the code is simple: Honor the gods, love your woman. . . . . .and defend your country. Troy is mother to us all. Fight for her! Myrmidons. . . . . .my brothers of the sword. I'd rather fight beside you than any army of thousands. Let no man forget how menacing we are. We are lions! Do you know what's there, waiting, beyond that beach? lmmortality! Take it! It's yours! Fight positions! Archers! Forward! The man wants to die. On my command! Break off! Break off! Look at him. Look. Row, you lazy whores, row! Greeks are dying! Row! Those men down there need help. Now! Tecton, with me. Flank! To the flank! Achilles! Achilles! Back to the city! Back to the city! The sun god is a patron of Troy, our enemy. Take whatever treasure you can find. With your permission, my lord. -Speak. -Apollo sees everything. Perhaps it is not wise to offend him. Warn the men. Wait. You are very brave or very stupid to come after me alone. You must be Hector. Do you know who I am? These priests weren't armed. Fight me! Why kill you now, prince of Troy. . . . . .with no one here to see you fall? Why did you come here? They'll be talking about this war for 1000 years. In 1000 years, the dust from our bones will be gone. Yes, prince. But our names will remain. Go home, prince. Drink some wine, make love to your wife. Tomorrow, we'll have our war. You speak of war as if it's a game. How many wives wait at Troy's gates for husbands they'll never see again? Your brother can comfort them. I hear he's good at charming other men's wives. My lord, you let him go? It's too early in the day for killing princes. Achilles! Achilles! -Achilles. -Ajax. You're as fearless as the gods. I'm honored to go to war with you. As am I. If you sailed slower, the war would be over. I'll miss the start as long as I'm here at the end. I've got something to show you. The men found her hiding in the temple. They thought she'd. . . . . .amuse you. What's your name? Did you not hear me? You killed Apollo's priests. I've killed men in five countries, never a priest. Well, then your men did. The sun god will have his vengeance. What's he waiting for? The right time to strike. His priests are dead, and his acolyte's a captive. -I think your god is afraid of me. -Afraid? Apollo is master of the sun. He fears nothing. -Where is he? -You're nothing but a killer! You wouldn't know anything about the gods. I know more about the gods than your priests. I've seen them. You're royalty, aren't you? Spent years talking down to men. You must be royalty. What's your name? Even the servants of Apollo have names. Briseis. Are you afraid, Briseis? Should I be? My lord. Agamemnon requests your presence. The kings are gathering to celebrate the victory. You fought well today. My lord. What do you want here in Troy? You didn't come for the Spartan queen. I want what all men want. I just want it more. You don't need to fear me, girl. You're the only Trojan who can say that. You have won a great victory, my king of kings. No one thought the Trojan beach could be captured so easily. A beautiful gift, Triopas. You will be among the first to walk in the streets of Troy tomorrow. My father, Neleus, had this urn made to commemorate his victory at Cyparisseis. I present it to you. . . . . .in honor of an even more memorable victory. Thank you, old friend. Tomorrow, we'll eat supper in the gardens of Troy. Leave us. War is young men dying and old men talking. You know this. Ignore the politics. Apparently, you won some great victory. Perhaps you didn't notice. The Trojan beach belonged to Priam in the morning. It belongs to Agamemnon in the afternoon. Have the beach. I didn't come here for sand. No. You came here because you want your name to last through the ages. A great victory was won today. But that victory is not yours. Kings did not kneel to Achilles. Kings did not pay homage to Achilles. Perhaps the kings were too far behind to see. Soldiers won the battle. History remembers kings! Not soldiers. Tomorrow, we'll batter down the gates of Troy. I'll build monuments on every island of Greece. I'll carve "" Agamemnon"" in the stone. Be careful, king of kings. First, you need the victory. Your men sacked the temple of Apollo, yes? You want gold? Take it. It's my gift to honor your courage. Take what you wish. I already have. Aphareus! Haemon! The spoils of war. No argument wit you, but if you don't release her, you'll never see home again. -Decide. -Guards! Stop! Too many men have died today. If killing is your only talent, that's your curse. I don't want anyone dying for me. Mighty Achilles, silenced by a slave girl. Tonight, I'll have her give me a bath. And then. . . -. . .who knows? -You sack of wine! Before my time is done, I will look down on your corpse and smile. If they want a war, we will give them a war. I would match the best of Troy against the best of Greece any day. The best of Greece outnumber the best of Troy two to one. Glaucus. You have fought with me for 40 years. Can we win this war? Our walls have never been breached. We have the finest archers in the world. And we have Hector. Yes, we can win. I spoke to two farmers today. They saw an eagle flying with a serpent clutched in its talons. This is a sign from Apollo. We will win a great victory tomorrow. Bird signs. You want to plan a strategy based on bird signs. Hector, show respect. The high priest is a servant of the gods. And I am a servant of Troy. I've always honored the gods, Father. But today I fought a Greek who desecrated the statue of Apollo. Apollo didn't strike the man down. The gods won't fight this war for us. There won't be a war. This is not a conflict of nations. It is a dispute between two men. I don't want to see another Trojan die because of me. Paris. Tomorrow morning, I will challenge Menelaus for the right to Helen. The winner will take her home. The loser will burn before nightfall. Father. . . . . .I'm sorry for the pain I've caused you. Do you love her? You are a great king because you love your country so much. Every blade of grass. Every grain of sand. Every rock in the river. You love all of Troy. That is the way I love Helen. I've fought many wars in my time. Some were fought for land, some for power, some for glory. I suppose fighting for love makes more sense than all the rest. But I won't be the one fighting. The sword of Troy. My father carried this sword, and his father before him. . . . . .all the way back to the founding of Troy. The history of our people was written with this sword. Carry it with you tomorrow. The spirit of Troy is in that sword. So long as a Trojan carries it. . . . . .our people have a future. The man who killed Tecton outside Apollo's temple. . . . . .I've never seen a spear thrown like that. An impossible throw. Don't go tomorrow. -Please don't go. -Paris fights tomorrow, not me. Fifty thousand Greeks didn't cross the sea to watch your brother fight. You know this. You'd make a fine general, my love. You've been fighting your whole life. Let other men do battle this time. You know I don't want to fight. I want to see my son grow tall. I want to see the girls chasing after him. I can't lose you. I won't survive. I must see Paris. Wait. Wait! Helen, what are you doing? -Let me go. -No. I saw them burn. I saw them burning on the pyres. That's my fault. It is. You know it is. All those widows. I still hear them screaming. Their husbands died because I'm here. I'm going down to the ships. No, you're not. -I'm giving myself back to Menelaus. -It's too late for that. Do you think Agamemnon cares about his brother's marriage? This is about power. Not love. Paris is going to fight in the morning. -Yes. -Menelaus will kill him. I won't let that happen. -It's his decision. -No. I can't ask anyone to fight for me. I'm no longer queen of Sparta. You're a princess of Troy now. . . . . .and my brother needs you tonight. My lord. My lord, the army is marching. -Let them march. We stay. -But the men are ready. We stay till Agamemnon groans to have Achilles back. As you wish. Are you ready to fight? Are you ready to kill? To take life? I am. At night, I see their faces, all the men I've killed. They're standing there on the far bank of the River Styx. They're waiting for me. They say, "" Welcome, brother. "" We men are wretched things. I taught you how to fight, but I never taught you why to fight. I fight for you. Who will you fight for when I'm gone? Soldiers, they fight for kings they've never even met. They do what they're told, die when they're told to. Soldiers obey. Don't waste your life following some fool's orders. Go. Are you sure you want to do this? I started this war. Helen. . . . . .sit with me. Prepare to halt! Prepare to halt! Halt! Move. I see you're not hiding behind your high walls. Valiant of you. Ill-advised, but valiant. You come here uninvited. Go back to your ships and go home. We've come too far, Prince Hector. Prince? What prince? What son of a king would accept a man's hospitality. . . . . .eat his food, drink his wine, then steal his wife in the middle of the night? The sun was shining when your wife left you. She's up there, watching, isn't she? Good. I want her to watch you die. Not yet, brother. Look around you, Hector. I brought all the warriors of Greece to your shores. You can still save Troy, young prince. I have two wishes. If you grant them, no more of your people need die. First, you must give Helen back to my brother. Second, Troy must submit to my command. . . . . .to fight for me whenever I call. You want me to look upon your army and tremble? Well, I see them. I see 50,000 men brought here to fight for one man's greed. Careful, boy. My mercy has limits. And I've seen the limits of your mercy. And I tell you now, no son of Troy will ever submit to a foreign ruler. Then every son of Troy shall die. There is another way. I love Helen. I won't give her up and neither will you. So let us fight our own battle. The winner takes Helen home. And let that be the end of it. A brave offer, but not enough. Let me kill this little peacock. I didn't come here for your pretty wife. I came here for Troy. I came for my honor. His every breath insults me. Let me kill him. When he's lying in the dust, signal to attack. You'll have your city. I'll have my revenge. So be it. I accept your challenge. And tonight, I'll drink to your bones. -My lord. -Back to the line! Make him swing and miss. He'll tire. Brother. . . . . .if I fall, tell Helen-- Tell her-- I will. Don't let Menelaus hurt her. If he-- You think of your sword and his sword and nothing else. Get up. Come on. See the crows? They never tasted prince before. Is this what you left me for?! Fight! Fight me! You coward! Fight me! We have a pact! Fight! Fight him, son. Fight him. -Fight me! -The Trojans have violated the agreement! Prepare for battle! This is not honor! This is not worthy of royalty! If he doesn't fight, Troy is doomed. The fight is over. The fight is not over. Stand back, Prince Hector. I'll kill him at your feet. I don't care. He is my brother. Paris! Go! Get inside, Paris! Archers! -Our men are too close to the walls. -Pull back, you fool! For Troy! -Now! -Loose! Get them in line! Get the men back into lines! Front line, push! Forward. Forward! Forward! Apollonians! Now! Prince Hector! We need to retreat! My army's never lost a battle yet! You won't have an army if you don't fall back! Back to the ships! -Back to the ships! -Retreat! -Back! -Retreat! Go back! Back. Back to the ships! Fall back! -Men, fall back! -Halt! Halt! But we have them on the run! We're in range of their archers. Have our men gather our fallen. Send an emissary to them. They can collect their dead. Would they have done the same for us? Go! Back! Fall back into line! You think I'm a coward. I am a coward. I knew he would kill me. You were watching. My father. My brother. All of Troy. Shame didn't matter. I gave up my pride. . . . . .my honor. . . . . .just to live. For love. You challenged a great warrior. That took courage. I betrayed you. Menelaus was a brave man. He lived for fighting. And every day I was with him, I wanted to walk into the sea and drown. I don't want a hero, my love. I want a man I can grow old with. They're laughing at me in Troy. Drunk with victory! They think I'll sail home at first light. Maybe we should. Flee? Like a whipped dog? The men believe we came here for Menelaus' wife. Won't be needing her anymore. My brother's blood still wets the sand, and you insult him! It's no insult to say a dead man is dead. If we leave now, we lose all credibility. The Trojans can beat us so easily. How long before the Hittites invade? If we stay, we stay here for the right reasons. To protect Greece, not your pride. Your private battle with Achilles is destroying us. Achilles is one man. Hector is one man. Look what he did to us today. Hector fights for his country! Achilles fights only for himself! I don't care about the man's allegiance. I care about his ability to win battles. He's right. The men's morale is weak. Even if I could make peace with Achilles, the man won't listen to me! He's as likely to spear me as to speak to me! I'll talk to him. He'll want the girl back. He can have that damn girl. I haven't touched her. Where is she? I gave her to the men. They need some amusement after today. Come on, give the bitch to me! Who's first? Trojan whore! What's this? A virgin's robe? -You won't be needing that much longer! -Hold her. Better to be a Spartan slave than a Trojan-- Achilles! Are you hurt? I watched you fight them. You have courage. To fight back when people attack me? Dog has that kind of courage. Eat. I've known men like you my whole life. No, you haven't. You think you're so different from 1000 others? Soldiers understand nothing but war. Peace confuses them. -And you hate these soldiers. -I pity them. Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you. Perhaps they deserve more than your pity. Why did you choose this life? -What life? -To be a great warrior. I chose nothing. I was born, and this is what I am. And you? Why did you choose to love a god? I think you'll find the romance one-sided. Do you enjoy provoking me? You've dedicated your life to the gods. Zeus, god of thunder. Athena, goddess of wisdom. You serve them. -Yes, of course. -And Ares, god of war? Who blankets his bed with the skin of men he's killed? All the gods are to be feared and respected. I'll tell you a secret. . . . . .something they don't teach you in your temple. The gods envy us. They envy us because we're mortal. Because any moment might be our last. Everything's more beautiful because we're doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again. I thought you were a dumb brute. I could have forgiven a dumb brute. Do it. Nothing is easier. Aren't you afraid? Everyone dies. Today or 50 years from now. What does it matter? Do it. You'll kill more men if I don't kill you. Many. My lord, there's-- Tell the men to start loading the ship. We're going home. Gather the stores. Agamemnon is a proud man. But he knows when he's made a mistake. The man sends you to make his apologies? What are you doing enthralled to that pig of a king? The world seems simple to you, my friend. . . . . .but when you're a king, very few choices are simple. Ithaca cannot afford an enemy like Agamemnon. Are we supposed to fear him? You don't fear anyone. That's your problem. Fear is useful. We need you back. Greece needs you. Greece got along fine before I was born. Greece will be Greece long after I'm dead. I'm not talking about the land. The men need you. Stay, Achilles. You were born for this war. Things are less simple today. Women have a way of complicating things. Of all the kings of Greece, I respect you the most. But in this war, you're a servant. Sometimes you have to serve in order to lead. I hope you understand that one day. We're going home? We sail in the morning. Greeks are being slaughtered. We can't just sail away. If it's fighting you still long for, there will always be another war. These are our countrymen. You betray all of Greece just to see Agamemnon fall. Someone has to lose. The gods favor our cause. Now is the time to destroy the Greek army. Their morale is battered. Hit them now. Hit them hard. And they will run. The Myrmidons didn't fight yesterday. There must be dissension among the Greeks. But if we attack their ships, we will unify them. If they decide to attack us, let them. Our walls can't be breached. We'll beat them back again. Yesterday, the Greeks underestimated us. We should not return the favor. You're confident about the meaning of these omens? The desecration of his temple angers Apollo. The gods have cursed the Greeks. Prepare the army. We attack at daybreak. Am I still your captive? You're my guest. In Troy, guests can leave whenever they want. You should leave then. Would you leave this all behind? Would you leave Troy? Hold those barricades! Archers to the rear. Achilles. Achilles. Now! Forward! Enough for one day. Yes. Back to the ships! Back to the ships! It was his cousin. To Troy! -Back to the city! -Back to the city! To Troy! We were going to sail home today. I don't think anyone's sailing home now. Achilles. You violated my command. No, my lord. There was a mistake. I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down. You led them into combat. I didn't lead them, my lord. We thought you did. Where's Patroclus? Patroclus! We thought he was you, my lord. He wore your armor, your shield, your greaves, your helmet. He even moved like you. Where is he? -Where? -He's dead, my lord. Hector cut his throat. Don't! Where are you taking me? Do you remember how to get here? Yes. The next time you come here, follow the tunnel. There are no turns, so you can't get lost. Just keep walking. When you get to the end, you'll be by the river. Follow the river until you get to Mount Ida. Why are you telling me this? -lf I die. . . -No. . . .I don't know how long the city will stand. If the Greeks get inside the walls, it's over. They'll kill all the men, throw the babies from the city walls. -Please. -The women, they'll take as slaves. -That, for you, will be worse than dying. -Why are you saying such things? Because I want you to be ready. I want you to get our boy, and I want you to bring him here. You save as many people as you can, but you get here. And you run. I killed a boy today. And he was young. He was much too young. That boy has just saved this war for us. -Eudorus. -My lord. I need my armor. No. Don't go! Rope! Hector's my cousin. He's a good man. Don't fight him. Please don't fight him. Please. No. Hector! Hector! Hector! Hector! Father. . . . . .forgive me for any offenses. I've served you as best as I could. Hector! May the gods be with you. Hector. No father ever had a better son. Hector! Apollo guard you, my prince. You're the best man I know. You're a prince of Troy. I know you'll make me proud. Hector! Remember what I told you. You don't have to go. You don't. You remember what I told you. Hector! Hector! I've seen this moment in my dreams. I'll make a pact with you. With the gods as our witnesses. . . . . .let us pledge that the winner will allow the loser all the proper funeral rituals. There are no pacts between lions and men. Now you know who you're fighting. I thought it was you I was fighting yesterday. And I wish it had been you. But I gave the dead boy the honor he deserved. You gave him the honor of your sword. You won't have eyes tonight. You won't have ears or a tongue. You'll wander the underworld, blind, deaf, and dumb, and all the dead will know: This is Hector, the fool who thought he killed Achilles. Get up, prince of Troy. Get up. I won't let a stone take my glory. You lost your cousin. Now you've taken mine. When does it end? It never ends. Who are you? I have endured what no one on earth has endured before. I kissed the hands of the man who killed my son. Priam? How did you get in here? I know my own country better than the Greeks, I think. You're a brave man. I could have your head on a spit in the blink of an eye. Do you really think death frightens me now? I watched my eldest son die. . . . . .watched you drag his body behind your chariot. Give him back to me. He deserves the honor of a proper burial. You know that. Give him to me. He killed my cousin. He thought it was you. How many cousins have you killed? How many sons and fathers and brothers and husbands? How many, brave Achilles? I knew your father. He died before his time. But he was lucky not to live long enough to see his son fall. You have taken everything from me. My eldest son. . . . . .heir to my throne. . . . . .defender of my kingdom. I cannot change what happened. It is the will of the gods. But give me this small mercy. I loved my boy from the moment he opened his eyes. . . . . .till the moment you closed them. Let me wash his body. Let me say the prayers. Let me place two coins on his eyes for the boatman. If I let you walk out of here. . . . . .if I let you take him. . . . . .it doesn't change anything. You're still my enemy in the morning. You're still my enemy tonight. But even enemies can show respect. I admire your courage. Meet me outside in a moment. We'll meet again soon, my brother. Your son was the best I've fought. In my country, the funeral games last for 12 days. It is the same in my country. Then the prince will have that honor. No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days. Briseis? I thought you were dead. You are free. If I hurt you. . . . . .it's not what I wanted. Go. No one will stop you. You have my word. Come, my girl. You're a far better king than the one leading this army. Achilles makes a secret pact, and I have to honor it? What treason is this? Consorting with the enemy king. Giving him 12 days of peace. Peace! Their prince is dead. Their army is leaderless. This is the time to attack! Even with Hector gone, we have no way to breach their walls. I will smash their walls to the ground. . . . . .if it costs me 40,000 Greeks. Hear me, Zeus! I will smash their walls to the ground. That's good. For my son back home. Well, Odysseus. You found a way to make the sheep invite the wolves to dinner. Forgive me, Eudorus. I should never have struck you. You've been a loyal friend all your life. I hope I never disappoint you again. It's I who have been the disappointment. Rouse the men. You're taking them home. Aren't you coming with us? I have my own battle to fight. Let me march beside you. No. I don't want our men to be a part of this. It's a beautiful night. Go, Eudorus. This is the last order I give you. Fighting for you has been my life's honor, my lord. Open the gates! Here. Plague. Don't go too close, my king. This is the will of the gods. They desecrated the temple of Apollo. . . . . .and Apollo desecrated their flesh. They thought they could come here and sack our city in a day. Now look at them, fleeing across the Aegean. What is this? An offering to Poseidon. The Greeks are praying for a safe return home. This is a gift. We should take it to the temple of Poseidon. -I think we should burn it. -Burn it? My prince, it's a gift to the gods. Father, burn it. Look at them. You'd think their prince had never died. You are the prince now. Make your brother proud. Briseis. Where is she? -Where? -I don't know. Please. I have a son. Then get him out of Troy. Briseis! Paris! Andromache! Helen. We must go. -Where? -I'll show you. Now. Hurry. Paris. It's a long way. Quick. We must go now. Briseis! Paris! Let it burn! Let Troy burn! Burn it! Burn it all! Burn Troy! Burn Troy! It's a long way. Quick. -Come. -I stay. -No. -My father will never abandon the city. I can't leave him. The city is dead. They're burning it to the ground. -What's your name? -Aeneas. -Do you know how to use a sword? -Yes. The sword of Troy. As long as it's in the hands of a Trojan, our people have a future. Protect them, Aeneas. Find them a new home. -I will. -Hurry. Paris, Briseis wasn't in her room. I'll find her. Go. -I'll stay with you. -Go. Please don't leave me. How could you love me if I ran now? We will be together again, in this world or the next. We will be together. Go. To the gate! Soldiers of Troy. . . . . .you men are warriors! To lead you has been my honor! My prince! The boatman waits for us. I say we make him wait a little longer! Paris! Paris! Have you no honor? Have you no honor? Too late for prayer, priestess. I almost lost this war because of your little romance. You'll be my slave in Mycenae. A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors. And at night. . . . Get up! Hold her. Come with me. No! Paris! No! Stop! Please! Paris! Don't! It's all right. It's all right. You gave me peace. . . . . .in a lifetime of war. Briseis, come. Go. You must. No. Troy is falling. Go. We must go. I know a way out. It's all right. Go. Briseis, come. Go. Find peace. . . . . .my brother. If they ever tell my story, let them say... ...I walked with giants. Men rise and fall like the winter wheat... ...but these names will never die. Let them say I lived in the time of Hector... ... tamer of horses. Let them say... ...I lived in the time of Achilles.

He arrived here just five minutes before yourself. As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter... ...earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located... ...a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. So that's that... ...and no harm done. Pea soup? No, thank you. - Minister? - Yes? - I don't understand. - Understand? I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home. Come now. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban... ...for blowing up their aunts. On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things... ...was very, very irresponsible. - ""The state of things,"" sir? - We have a killer on the loose. Sirius Black, you mean? But what's he got to do with me? Nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters. And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty... ...of having them brought here. Now Tom will show you to your room. Hedwig. Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't... ...wander. Right!

It should be great. Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me... ...from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you. But I think that you need to know the facts. You are in danger. Grave danger. Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir? What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry? - Only that he's escaped from Azkaban. - Do you know why? Thirteen years ago, when you stopped... - Voldemort. - Don't say his name. Sorry. When you stopped You-Know-Who... ...Black lost everything. But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant. And in his mind... ...you are the only thing that stands in the way... ...of You-Know-Who returning to power. And that is why... ...he has escaped from Azkaban. To find you. And kill me. Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear... ...you won't go looking for Black. Mr. Weasley... ...why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me? Quick. Quick. Ron, Ron! Oh, for goodness' sake! Don't lose him! I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... - I lost control. - Brilliant. Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled. I was lucky not to be arrested. I still think it was brilliant. Come on. Everywhere else is full. Who do you think that is? - Professor R.J. Lupin. - Do you know everything? How is it she knows everything? - It's on his suitcase, Ronald. - Oh. - Do you think he's really asleep? - Seems to be. Why? I gotta tell you something. Let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban... ...to come after you? - Yeah. But they'll catch Black, won't they? - I mean, everyone's looking for him. - Sure. Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before... ...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic. - Thanks, Ron. Why are we stopping? We can't be there yet. What's going on? I don't know. Maybe we've broken down. Ouch, Ron. That was my foot. There's something moving out there. I think someone's coming aboard. Bloody hell! What's happening? Harry. Harry, are you all right? Thank you. Here, eat this. It'll help. It's all right. It's chocolate. What was that thing that came? It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. It was searching the train for Sirius Black. If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver. Eat. You'll feel better. What happened to me? Well, you sort of went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something. And did either of you two... ...you know... ...pass out? - No. I felt weird, though. Like I'd never be cheerful again. But someone was screaming. A woman. No one was screaming, Harry. Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts. Now, I'd like to say a few words... ...before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin... ...who's kindly consented to fill the post... ...of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Good luck, professor. Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry. Potter. Is it true you fainted? - I mean, you actually fainted? - Shove off, Malfoy. - How did he find out? - Just forget it. Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher... ...has decided to retire... ...in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce... ...that his place will be taken by none other... ...than our own Rubeus Hagrid. Finally, on a more disquieting note... ...at the request of the Ministry of Magic... ...Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban... ...until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now whilst I've been assured... ...that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... ...a word of caution. Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish... ...between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you... ...to give them no reason to harm you. It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But you know, happiness can be found... ...even in the darkest of times... ...if one only remembers to turn on the light. Fortuna Major. Here, listen. She just won't let me in. - Fortuna Major. - No, no. Wait, wait. Watch this. - Amazing. Just with my voice. - Fortuna Major. - Yes, all right. Go in. - Thank you. Still doing that after three years. - She can't even sing. - Exactly. - Hey, man. - Hey, man. - Oh, God. - That's awful. Green. That's a monkey. - What is that? - You call that a monkey? Do not give him one again. Hey, Neville, try an elephant. - Ron, catch. - I will. I think we have a winner. - Oh, don't try one of them. - Oh, no. Look at him. His face. Welcome, my children. In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination. In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight. Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together we shall cast ourselves into the future. This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves. So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you. What do you see? The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read. But first, you must broaden your minds. - First, you must look beyond. - What a load of rubbish. - Where did you come from? - Me? - I've been here all this time. - You, boy... Is your grandmother quite well? I think so. I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup. Pity. Broaden your minds. Your aura is pulsing, dear. Are you in the beyond? - I think you are. - Sure. Look at the cup. Tell me what you see. Yeah. Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering. And that there could be the sun and that's happiness. So... ...you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it. Give me the cup. Oh, my dear boy. My dear... ...you have the Grim. The Grin? What's the Grin? Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim. ""Taking form of a giant spectral dog. It's among the darkest omens in our world. It's an omen... ...of death."" You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black? Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline. Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject. Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking? A fair few. Hang on. That's not possible. Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination. You have to be in two classes at once. Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once? ""Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future."" That's it. Come on, now. Come closer. Less talking, if you don't mind. I got a real treat for you today. A great lesson. So follow me. Right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there. And open your books to page 49. Exactly how do we do that? Just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me. - Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom. - I'm okay. Okay. - I think they're funny. - Oh, yeah. Terribly funny. Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes. Shut up, Malfoy. Dementor! Dementor! - Just ignore him. - You're supposed to stroke it. Yeah. Isn't he beautiful? Say hello to Buckbeak. Hagrid, exactly what is that? That, Ron, is a hippogriff. First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures. Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. It may be the last thing you ever do. Now, who'd like to come and say hello? Well done, Harry. Well done. Come on now. Now... ...you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So... ...step up. Give him a nice bow. Then you wait and see if he bows back. If he does, you can go and touch him. If not... Well, we'll get to that later. Just make your bow. Nice and low. Back off, Harry. Back off. Keep still. Keep still. Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you. Right. I think you can go and pat him now. Go on. Don't be shy. Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow. Not so fast, Harry. Slow down, Harry. That's it... Nice and slow. Now let him come to you. Slowly, now, slowly, slowly... That's it... Yes! Well done! Well done, Harry, well done! Does he get to fly? - I think he may let you ride him now. - What? - Come on. - Hey, hey, hey! Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that. Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak. That was wicked, Harry! Oh, please. Well done, well done. - How am I doing me first day? - Brilliant, professor. You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute! Malfoy, no... No! Buckbeak! Whoa, whoa, whoa... Whoa! Buckbeak! Away, you silly creature... - It's killed me! - Calm down. It's just a scratch! Hagrid! - He has to be taken to the hospital. - I'm the teacher. I'll do it. - You're gonna regret this. - Class dismissed! You and your bloody chicken! Does it hurt terribly, Draco? It comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky. Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm. - I can't do homework for weeks. - Listen to the idiot. - He's really laying it on thick, isn't he? - At least Hagrid didn't get fired. I hear Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this. - He's been sighted! - Who? Sirius Black! Dufftown? That's not far from here. You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you? - With dementors at every entrance? - Dementors? He slipped past them once. Who's to say he won't do it again? That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke. Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands. Intriguing, isn't it? Would anyone like to venture a guess... ...as to what is inside? - That's a boggart, that is. - Very good, Mr. Thomas. Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like? - No one knows. - When did she get here? Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most. - That's what makes them so... - So terrifying, yes, yes, yes... Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. Let's practice it now. Without wands, please. After me. Riddikulus! - Riddikulus! - Very good. A little louder and very clear. - Riddikulus! - Riddikulus! - This class is ridiculous. - Very good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough. What really finishes a boggart is laughter. You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Let me explain. Neville, would you join me, please? Come on, don't be shy. Come on. Come on. Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all? Professor Snape. - Sorry? - Professor Snape. Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all. - You live with your grandmother. - I don't want it to turn into her, either. No... ...it won't. I want you to picture her clothes. Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind. - She carries a red handbag... - We don't need to hear. As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe... ...here's what I want you to do. Excuse me. Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes. Can you do that? Yes. Wand at the ready. One, two, three. Think, Neville, think. Riddikulus! Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay... ...to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line... Form a line! I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most... ...and turn it into something funny. Next! Ron! Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave! Wand at the ready, Ron. Riddikulus! Yes! You see? Very good, very good! Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next! Show us what you see. Keep your nerve. Steady. Riddikulus! And next! Step up, step up! Wonderful, wonderful! Here! Riddikulus! Right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today. Collect your books from the back. That's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry! Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing. Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege. Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school... ...that privilege shall not be extended again. No permission form signed, no visiting the village. That's the rule, Potter. Those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put. I thought if you signed it, then I could... I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign. Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word. Forget about it, guys. See you later. Professor, can I ask you something? You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes? I thought it'd be obvious. I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort. I did think of Voldemort at first. But then I remembered that night on the train... ...and the dementor. - I'm very impressed. That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself. This is very wise. Before I fainted... ...I heard something. A woman... ...screaming. Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. Our pain becomes their power. I think it was my mother... ...the night she was murdered. The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother, Lily's. Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch... ...she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... ...even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. And your father, James, on the other hand... ...he... He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. You're more like them than you know, Harry. In time, you'll come to see just how much. Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop. We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack. - You heard it's the most... - Haunted building in Britain. I know. What's going on? Probably Neville forgot the password again. - Hey. - Oh, you're there. Let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy! Get back, all of you. No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched. The Fat Lady! She's gone! Serves her right. She was a terrible singer. It's not funny, Ron. Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room. - Be quiet. - Make way. - The headmaster's here. - Come on, move. You heard. Move! Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady. There's no need for ghosts, professor. The Fat Lady's there. Mind where you're going! Slow down! You listen! I'm Head Boy! - Come back here! - Keep moving! Dear lady, who did this to you? Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name. It's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about. He's here, somewhere in the castle! Sirius Black! Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall. I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery. There's nothing there. - Thank you. - The third floor's clear too, sir. - Very good. - I've done the dungeons. No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle. I didn't really expect him to linger. Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own... ...completely undetected? - Quite remarkable, yes. Any theories on how he managed it? Many. Each as unlikely as the next. You may recall... ...prior to the start of term I expressed concerns... ...about your appointment of Professor... Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it. I'm quite convinced the castle is safe... ...and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses. What about Potter? Should he be warned? Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep. For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own. Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud. Turn to page 394. Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin? That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... ...at the present time. Turn to page 394. ""Werewolves""? Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. - We're not meant to start that for weeks. - Quiet. When did she come in? Did you see her come in? Now, which one of you can tell me the difference... ...between an Animagus and a werewolf? No one? - How disappointing. - Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon... ...he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend. The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind. Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time... ...you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Are you incapable of restraining yourself... ...or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all? - He's got a point, you know. - Five points from Gryffindor. As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning... ...two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis... ...on recognizing it. - It's Quidditch tomorrow. Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter. Loss of limb will not excuse you. Page 394. The term ""werewolf""... ...is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word ""wer""... ...which means ""man,"" and ""wolf."" Werewolf, man-wolf. There are several ways to become a werewolf. They include being given the power of shape-shifting... ...being bitten by a werewolf... Go, Harry! Go, Harry! Aresto momentum! - He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? - Peaky? What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet. Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like. Probably a right sight better than he normally does. - How are you feeling? - Oh, brilliant. You gave us a right good scare. - What happened? - Well, you fell off your broom. Really? I meant the match. Who won? No one blames you, Harry. Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious. After he saved you, he sent them off. There's something else you should know too. When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and... Well... I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick. Is there no chance of fixing it? No. Professor, why do the dementors affect me so? - I mean, more than everyone else? - Listen. Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory... ...until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. You are not weak, Harry. Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of. - I'm scared, professor. - I'd consider you a fool if you weren't. I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. You made the one on the train go away. There was only one that night. - But you made it go away. - I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you... ...perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays. For now, I need to rest. Last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now! - Guys, let me go. - Clever, Harry. - But not clever enough. - We've got a better way. - I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade. - We know. We'll get you there. - We'll show you a quicker way. - lf you pipe down. - Bless him. - Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't... - Now, Harry. - Come and join the big boys. What are you doing?! - What's this rubbish? - ""What's this rubbish?"" he says. - It's the secret to our success. - It's a wrench giving it to you... But we've decided your needs are greater than ours. George, if you will. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. ""Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... ...are proud to present the Marauder's Map."" We owe them so much. Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... - No. Is that really...? - Dumbledore. - In his study. - Pacing. Does that a lot. - So this map shows...? - Everyone. - Where they are. - What they're doing. - Every minute. - Every day. - Brilliant! Where did you get it? - From Filch's office. - First year. - There are seven secret passageways... ...out of the castle. - We'd recommend this one. - The One-Eyed Witch passageway. - Leads you to Honeyduke's. Hurry. Filch is heading this way. And don't forget. When you're done, ""Mischief managed."" Otherwise, anyone can read it. Now, how much do you want? Delicious. It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that? Twice. Do you want to move a bit closer? To the Shrieking Shack? Actually, I'm fine here. Well, well. Look who's here. You two shopping for your new dream home? Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in one room? - Shut your mouth, Malfoy. - Not very friendly. Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors. - Hope you don't mean yourself. - How dare you talk to me! You filthy little mudblood! Who is that? - Don't stand there! Do something! - What? What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis? Get out of the way! Move! Malfoy! Wait! Wait! Harry! Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny. Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map. He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall. - Aren't you? - Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak. Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta. - Ron fancies her. - That's not true! - Professor McGonagall! - Cornelius! Allow me, minister. - Oh, Hagrid... - Sorry about that. Rosmerta, my dear. I hope business is good. It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors... ...into my pub every other night! - We have... - We have a killer on the loose. - Sirius Black in Hogsmeade! And what would bring him here? - Harry Potter. - Harry Potter? Come. Harry! - No underage wizards allowed in today! - Shut the damn door! - So rude. - Thick heads. - Thick heads?! - How dare they! - Who are they calling thick heads? - Young whippersnappers! Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits. Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place. Tell me what this is all about. Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death... Remember? They hid. Few knew where they were. One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who. Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night... ...he also killed Peter Pettigrew! - Peter Pettigrew? - Little lump of a boy. - Always trailing after Black. - I remember. Never let James and Sirius out of his sight. - What happened? - Peter tried to warn the Potters... ...and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black. Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him! A finger. That's all that was left. A finger. Nothing else. Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters... ...but he's the reason they're dead. - He wants to finish things. - I don't believe it. - That's not the worst of it. - What could be worse? - This: Sirius Black was... ...and remains to this day... ...Harry Potter's godfather! Ron, look! - Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. - Merry Christmas. Harry, what happened? He was their friend... ...and he betrayed them. He was their friend! I hope he finds me. Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him! Harry. There you are. You came. Are you sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic... ...well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level. I'm sure. Well, everything's prepared. The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. Did you ever hear of it? No? Well... A Patronus is a positive force. For the wizard who conjures one... ...it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory. Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory. Can you do this? Yes. Very well. Close your eyes. Concentrate. Explore your past. Do you have a memory? Allow it to fill you up. Lose yourself within it. Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum. - Expecto Patronum. - Very good. Shall we? Wand at the ready. Expecto Patronum! Expecto... Expecto... Expect... Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths. It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time. That would have been remarkable. Here, eat this. You'll feel better. - That's one nasty dementor. - Oh, no, no, no. That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart. The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. As a matter of interest, what were you thinking? - Which memory did you choose? - The first time I rode a broom. That's not good enough. Not nearly good enough. There's another. It's not happy, exactly. Well, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt... ...but it's complicated. - Is it strong? Then let's give it a try. You feel ready? Just do it. Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum! Yes! Well done, Harry. Well done! - I think I've had enough for today. - Yes. Sit down. Here. Eat this, it helps. It really helps. And just so you know, Harry... ...I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that... ...is saying something. I was thinking of him. And Mum. Seeing their faces. They were talking to me. Just talking. That's the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real. But it's the best I have. - Beautiful day. - Gorgeous. Unless you've been ripped to pieces! Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about? - Ronald has lost his rat. - I haven't lost anything! - Your cat killed him! - Rubbish. Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... ...is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone. Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets! - Your cat killed him! - Did not. - Did. - Didn't. How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing? Well, first off, the committee members took turns... ...talking about why we were there. I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak... ...was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine. He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature... ...who would kill you as soon as look at you. And then? And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius. - They're not sacking you! - No, I'm not sacked. Buckbeak's been sentenced to death! Spiders! There's... There's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap-dance. - I don't wanna tap-dance! - You tell those spiders. Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them... - Peter Pettigrew? - Little lump of a boy. - Always trailing after Sirius Black. - Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him! - Put that light out! - Sorry. - Watch it there, boy. - We're trying to sleep here! Mischief managed. Nox. Potter. What are you doing wandering the corridors at night? I was sleepwalking. How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle. My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand. Turn out your pockets. Turn out your pockets! What's this? - Spare bit of parchment. - Really? Open it. Reveal your secrets. Read it. ""Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... ...offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."" Go on. ""And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."" - You insolent little... - Professor! Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we? Harry, are you all right? That remains to be seen. I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact. Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. - Clearly, it's full of dark magic. - I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone... ...who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night. Are you deaf? Put that light out! Come in. I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession... ...but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in. Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black... ...is a map to you? - No. - No, sir. Your father never set much store by the rules either. But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected... ...with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them! Now, I will not cover up for you again. - Do you hear me? - Yes, sir. I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know. Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead. Oh, really? And who might that be? Peter Pettigrew. That's not possible. It's just what I saw. Good night, professor. Broaden your minds. You must look beyond. The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye. Only then can you see. Try again. Now, what do we have here? Do you mind me trying? The Grim, possibly. My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class... ...I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit... ...for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there. You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled... ...as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books... ...to which you so desperately cleave. Have I said something? She's gone mental, Hermione has. Not that she wasn't always mental... ...but now it's in the open for everyone to see. Hang on. - We better take this back. - I'm not going back. - Fine. See you later. - See you. Harry Potter... - Professor Trelawney... - He will return tonight. Sorry? Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder... ...shall break free. Innocent blood shall be spilt... ...and servant and master shall be reunited once more. I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something? No. Nothing. I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible. - It just got worse. - What did I say? Father said... ...I can keep the hippogriff's head. I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room. This is going to be rich. - Look who's here. - Come to see the show? You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! Hermione, no! He's not worth it. Malfoy, are you okay? - Let's go. Quick. - Not a word to anyone, understood? - That felt good. - Not good, brilliant. Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them. Why don't we just set him free? They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore... ...would get into trouble. He's coming down, Dumbledore. Says he wants to be with me when they... When it happens. Great man, Dumbledore. A great man. - We'll stay with you too. - You'll do no such thing! Think I want you seeing something like that? No. You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron... Scabbers! You're alive! - Keep a closer eye on your pet. - I think you owe someone an apology. Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know. I meant me! Blimey. What was that? Hagrid! Oh, crikey. No, minister. Over this way. It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here. Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble. Particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment! Quick. Quick! Hagrid. - It'll be fine. It'll be okay. - Go on, go on! - That's ling you see over there... - On the slope. - On the slope... Ah, Hagrid. - Professor Dumbledore. - Good evening. - Minister. Make your way through. - Have a tea, if you like. - No, Hagrid. - Gentlemen. - I'd like a cup of tea. Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal... ...of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak... ...hereinafter called ""the condemned,"" shall be executed this day at sundown. - Dear, dear... - Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on. - All right. It'll be all right. - The execution shall dispatch... What? I thought I just saw... - Never mind. - Let's go! Buckbeak didn't mean no harm. Oh, no. He bit me. Scabbers. Ron. Ron! - Ron! - Scabbers, come back. Wait! - Scabbers, you bit me! - Harry, you do realize what tree this is? That's not good. Ron, run! Harry, Hermione, run! It's the Grim! - Harry! - Ron! Ron, wait! Harry! - Help! - Ron! - Ron. Ron. - Ron! Come on! Move! Duck! Harry! - Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't worry. - Where do you suppose this goes? - I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong. We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we? Come on. Ron. - Ron. You're okay. - The dog. Where is it? It's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus. If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too! No. Only one will die tonight. Then it'll be you! Are you going to kill me, Harry? Expelliarmus! Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we? Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within. Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you? - I found him. - I know. - He's here. - I understand. - Let's kill him! - No! I trusted you! And all this time, you've been his friend. He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes. How long have you known? - Since Professor Snape set the essay. - Well, Hermione. You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met. Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him! - Wait! - I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban! Very well. Kill him. But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why. I know why. You betrayed my parents. - You're the reason they're dead! - No, it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents... ...somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead! - Who was it, then? - Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room! Right now! Come out, come out, Peter! - Come out, come out and play! - Expelliarmus! Vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you. Severus... I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. Here's the proof. Brilliant, Snape. You put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion. If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business... ...to attend to. - Give me a reason. I beg you! - Don't be a fool. - He can't help it. It's habit. - Be quiet. - Be quiet yourself! You two, quarrelling like an old married couple. Run along and play with your chemistry set! I could do it, you know. But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you. Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes. A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best. Severus, please. After you. Expelliarmus! - Harry! What did you just do? - You attacked a teacher! - Tell me about Peter. - He was at school with us. We thought he was our friend! - No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him! - No, he didn't. I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map! - The map was lying, then. - The map never lies! Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there! - Me?! He's mental! - Not you! Your rat! - Scabbers has been in my family for... - Twelve years? Curiously long life for a common garden rat! - He's missing a toe, isn't he? - So what? - All they could find of Pettigrew was his... - Finger! Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead! - And then he transformed into a rat! - Show me. - Give it to him, Ron. - What are you trying to do to him? Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing? Remus? Sirius. My old friends! Harry! Look at you. You look so much like your father. - James. We were the best of friends... - How dare you speak to Harry! How dare you talk about James in front of him! - You sold James and Lily to Voldemort! - I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you have done? - What would you have done? - Died, rather than betray my friends! James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad would have spared me! He would have shown me mercy! Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would. Together! No! - Harry, this man... - I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle. - Bless you, boy. Bless you! - Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the dementors can have you. Sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit. A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off! I was going for the rat. Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog. More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent. The tail I could live with. But the fleas, they're murder. Okay. - You better go. - No. Don't worry, okay? It's fine. I'll stay. You go, I'll stay. - You okay? - I'm fine. Go. - That looks really painful. - So painful. They might chop it. I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat. It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off. It's beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it. I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends... ...to become killers. Besides, dead, the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free. Turn me into a flobberworm. Anything but the dementors! Ron! Haven't I been a good pet? You won't let them give me... ...to the dementors, will you? I was your rat! - Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't... - Get away from her! I don't know if you know, Harry... ...but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather. I know. I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle... ...but if you ever wanted a different home... What? Come and live with you? It's just a thought. I can understand if you don't want to. Harry! Remus, my old friend. Have you taken your potion tonight? You know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! Here! This flesh is only flesh! Expelliarmus! Harry! Remus! Remus! Run! Run! - Come on. - Wait. Wait. Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea. Professor? Professor Lupin? Nice doggy. Nice doggy! There you are, Potter! Sirius! Come back here, Potter! Sirius! No. Sirius! Expecto Patronum! Harry? I saw my dad. What? He sent the dementors away. I saw him across the lake. Harry, they've captured Sirius. Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss. - They're gonna kill him? - No. It's worse. Much worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster, stop them. - They've got the wrong man. - It's true. Sirius is innocent. - It's Scabbers who did it. - Scabbers? He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. He was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat. - But then they gave him an owl... - The point is, we know the truth. - Please believe us. - I do, Miss Granger. But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true... ...is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. Mysterious thing, time. Powerful... ...and when meddled with, dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight... ...more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns should do it, I think. Oh, and by the way. When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck. What the bloody hell was that all about? Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk... What just happened? - Where's Ron? Where were we at 7:30? I don't know. Going to Hagrid's? Come on. And we can't be seen. Hermione! Hermione! Hermione, wait. Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing? You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! That's us. Hermione, no! He's not worth it. This is not normal. This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year. - You mean we've gone back in time? - Yes. Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly, something happened he wants us to change. Good punch. Thanks. Malfoy's coming. - Run. - Not a word to anyone, understood? I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words. - That felt good. - Not good, brilliant. Come on. We should be at Hagrid's. Look. Buckbeak's still alive. Of course. Remember what Dumbledore said? If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. Let's go. Here they come. I'd better hurry. Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free. Scabbers, you're alive! - Keep a closer eye on your pet. - That's Pettigrew. - Harry, you can't. - He betrayed my parents. - You don't expect me to sit here. - Yes, and you must! Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. We can't be seen. Fudge is coming. And we aren't leaving? Why aren't we leaving? Are you mad? That hurt. Sorry. We're coming out the back door. Go! Is that really what my hair looks like from the back? What? I thought I just saw... - Never mind. - Let's go. Okay, go, Harry. Go! Get away. Get off. Minister, I really think I should sign as well. Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be... Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on. Keep trying. Come on. Quickly. Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay? - Your name only. - It's such a very long name... Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay? Come on. Come on, Buckbeak. Come and get the nice dead ferret. - Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky. - Here we are, minister. Follow me. - Now, look there. - Where? - Look beyond the rocks. - What am I supposed to see? Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster. - Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed. - And all the strawberries. - Come on, Buckbeak. Come on. - I see no strawberries. - Over there. - Where? - Over there. - This way. - Let's get this over, please. - All right. But where is it? I saw the beast, just now. - Not a moment ago! - How extraordinary. Buckbeak. Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him. - Hagrid? - Buckbeak. I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. How could you? You've been with us all the time. - Right. - Well, well... We must search the grounds. Well, search the skies, if you must, minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. Thank you. You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor. - Come on. - This way. This way, now. - Now what? - We save Sirius. - How? - No idea. - Look. It's Lupin. - Immobulus! And Snape's coming. And now we wait. And now we wait. - At least someone's enjoying himself. - Yeah. - Hermione? - Yeah? Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... ...I did see someone. That someone made the dementors go away. With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. According to him... ...only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it. It was my dad. My dad conjured the Patronus. - Harry, but your dad's... - Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw. Here we come. You see Sirius talking to me there? - He's asking me to come live with him. - That's great. When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country... ...someplace you can see the sky. He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban. Harry! Run! Let's go. - What are you doing? - Saving your life. Thanks. - Great. Now he's coming for us. - Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run! That was so scary. Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night. Sirius. Come on! - This is horrible. - Don't worry. My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus. Any minute now. Right there. You'll see. Harry, listen to me. No one's coming. Don't worry, he will. He will come. - Sirius. - You're dying... ...both of you. Harry! Expecto Patronum! You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time because... ...well, I had already done it. - Does that make sense? - No. But I don't like flying...! Bombarda! I'll be forever grateful for this... ...to both of you. - I want to go with you. - One day, perhaps. For some time, my life will be too unpredictable. And besides... ...you're meant to be here. - But you're innocent. And you know it. And for now, that will do. I expect you're tired of hearing this... ...but you look so like your father. Except your eyes. - You have... - My mother's eyes. It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little. But know this: The ones that love us never really leave us. And you can always find them... ...in here. You really are the brightest witch of your age. We have to go. - Well? - He's free. We did it. Did what? Good night. How did you get there? I was talking to you there. And now you're there. - What's he talking about, Harry? - I don't know. Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once? Hello, Harry. I saw you coming. I've looked worse, believe me. - You've been sacked. - No. No. I resigned, actually. Resigned? Why? Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want... ...well, someone like me teaching their children. - But Dumbledore... - He has already... ...risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me are... Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now. Why do you look so miserable, Harry? None of it made any difference. - Pettigrew escaped. - Didn't make any difference? It made all the difference in the world. You uncovered the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. It made a great deal of difference. If I am proud of anything... ...it is of how much you have learned this year. Now, since I am no longer your teacher... ...I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. So now I'll say goodbye, Harry. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Until then... ...mischief managed. Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle. Harry. Wherever did you get it? Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course. - What are you talking about? - Quiet. Let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry. It was badly wrapped. They made me do it. Did not. - It's a Firebolt. - It's the fastest broom in the world. For me? - But who sent it? - No one knows. This came with it. - Go on, Harry! - Yeah, let's see. How fast is it, Harry? Lumos. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. Mischief managed., Hey, watch it. Oh, come on. Hey, Mike! - Hey, Larry. - How you doing? Have you seen Nicky? I'm pretty sure he went with Erica. It was half day today. Parent Career Day. - Hey. - Hey. Come on in. - You all right? - Yeah, yeah. Why didn't anybody tell me it was Career Day? What do you mean? Nicky said he was gonna tell you. Oh, okay, I guess he forgot. There he is. How are you, Larry? Good. How are you doing, Don? Good. Can you believe this weather? Chilly, right? Chilly, chilly, Chilly Willy the penguin. Leave me alone. Hey, why don't I go tell the little corncob you're here. Great. Great, that's great. Yeah, thanks. Wow, your fiance really manages to squeeze a lot onto that belt. - Stop it. - What? What? No, it's like he's... ...the Batman of stockbrokers. - Bond trader. - Bond trader. Sorry. Hey, how's it going with that virtual-reality driving range that you wanted to open? Getting there, still waiting for the technology to catch up. It's not easy, there are a lot of moving parts. Hey, do you think Nick would like Queens? Oh, no, Larry. You didn't get evicted again, did you? I didn't... ...get evicted. I didn't get evicted, no. I mean, I didn't... - No, I didn't get evicted yet. It's like-- - Larry, listen to me. I don't know how much more Nicky can take. Every couple months, it's a new career, a new apartment. If it wasn't for Nicky, I wouldn't say anything, I would stay out of it. It's just, it's too much instability. It's not good for him. I'm trying to figure things out right now, okay? You know... ...I don't think that Nicky should stay with you. - What? - Just until you get really settled. Hey, Dad. - Hey, ready to carve it up? - Cool. All right, good! Take it, Nicky! Break away! - What are you doing? - Hey, Nicky! Are you all right? - You okay? - I'm fine. Would you get off the ice? Listen. Their left defenseman is a very weak skater. So you go left side, you got a clear shot at the goal. Okay? - Cool, thanks. - All right, man. We're good here. We're good. All right. As you were, skaters. Game on! I'm good. I'm telling you, you tore it up out there today. Thinking the NHL is a serious possibility. I don't really wanna be a hockey player anymore. - All right. What do you wanna be? - A bond trader. A bond trader? Yeah, it's what Don does. He took me to his office last week. That's cool. So you wanna dress up in a monkey suit and tie every day? Like an automaton robot? Trust me, you can't play hockey in a cubicle. Kind of awkward. Well, he's got a pretty big office. That's not the point. Come on, you love hockey. I still like it, but bond trading's my fallback. Your fallback? Wait a minute. You're too young to have a fallback, okay? And also, where did you ever even hear that word? Mom was talking to Don about all your different schemes. She called them schemes? She said it was time you found a fallback. Are you really moving again? I don't know. We'll see. I mean... ...there's some pretty cool places out in Queens. - Yeah. - Hey. Hey, Nicky, look at me. Look at me, man. I wanna tell you something. I know that things have been kind of up and down for me lately... ...and that's been hard for you. But I really feel like my moment's coming and when it does... ...everything's just gonna come together, you know? What if you're wrong... ...and you're just an ordinary guy who should get a job? All right, well... You know what, we'll figure it out, okay? All right? Come on, let's get you back to Mom's. Mr. Daley, I can honestly say, in 43 years at this agency... ...I've never seen a resume quite like yours. All right. That wasn't a compliment. It says here you were the CEO... ...of Snaptime lndustries. Care to elaborate on that? Sure. Well, that was the umbrella corporation for my invention, the Snapper. You know, you snap, the lights come on. Snap, they come off. Didn't they already make that? No, no, that's the Clapper, which, obviously... ...stole a bit of our thunder. Personally, I don't really see what the big difference is, I mean: You know, whatever, but... ...apparently there is a significant portion of the population that has trouble actually... - ...snapping. - Clapping's easier. Debatable. I can't help you. Debbie? Can I call you Debbie? Because... ...I felt a connection when I entered this office... ...and I don't know, I feel like you did too. I didn't feel a connection. Look. I need a job tomorrow, okay? If I don't have one... Well, I just need it, okay? Well, I don't know. I might have one thing. They've turned down everyone I've sent over there, but-- Great. -- who knows? You might get lucky. - Excuse me. Hi. - Hi. I'm Larry Daley. I've got a job interview with Cecil Fredricks. - Right. He should still be in his office. - Great. - I'm Rebecca Hutman. I'm a docent here. - Hi. - Let me point you in the right direction. - Great. Teddy Roosevelt, right? - Yes, a great visionary. - Yes, definitely. He was our 4th president, right? - Twenty-sixth. - Twenty-sixth. Please don't touch the exhibits! I mean... Riffraff. Miss Hutman. I cannot tolerate this type of chaos. I mean, this is a museum, not a... Do you know what ""museum"" means? It doesn't mean, ""Daddy, it's a big Tyrannosaurus thing. Can I touch its leg? "" No! Work it out, please. - Will do, sir. - Thank you. Dr. McPhee, the museum director. Seems like a fun guy. Control your young, please. Can we? Hello? Just kidding. Hi. I'm Larry Daley. Are you Mr. Fredricks? Mr. Fredricks was my father. I am Cecil. Good to meet you, Larry. Nice firm handshake. I like that. Tells a lot about a man. Come on in. Let's talk turkey here. The museum is losing money, hand over fist. I guess kids today don't care about wax figures or stuffed animals. So they're downsizing, which is code for firing... ...myself and the other two night guards. They want to replace us with one new guard. - Oh, sorry. - Well, what are you gonna do? I'd like you to meet my two colleagues here. Reginald? Gus? Where is he? I'll beat him with my fist! Gus, this is Larry Daley, the kid who wants to be the new night guard. Night guard? No, the lady at the agency said this was a museum position. Most important position in the museum, Larry. He looks like a weirdie. Wonderful guard, terrible people skills. Now, listen, lunch box. Don't try anything funny. I once went nine rounds with John L. Sullivan. You never fought John L. Sullivan in your life. Gentlemen, we have a job candidate here. He's got an excellent resume, a winning attitude... ...and I say let's give him a shot. What do you say? Hang on a sec. I think I might wanna have a little time just to think it over. Do you want the job or not, snack shack? - No, no, I want the job-- - Welcome to the night guards, Larry. Larry, meet me up on the second floor. I'll slip into my orthopedics and give you a little tour. Arthritic knees. Not fun getting old, my friend. Go on. You really think he's the one? Oh, yes. He's the one. Gotta keep it moving, Larry. I'm pretty spry for an old man. This is the Diorama Room. Oh, yeah. I remember these little guys. Cute. Cecil! Hey, Cecil! - Did I get you good? - Yeah. You got me. Seriously, though, no fooling around in here. This stuff is really old. All right, then. As you can see, it's pretty quiet in here these days. On the left there is your Attila the Hun. And here we have our Easter lsland head. Hey, Cecil. And this, of course, is the Hall of African Mammals. Ah, yes. Monkeys. I love monkeys. - Yeah. - Guy's cute. Yeah, we call him Dexter. He's quite a little... ...ball of fun, aren't you, Dexter? Moving on. And, finally, this is the temple of the Pharaoh Ahkmenrah. And in that tomb right down there, the pharaoh himself. Neat. And hanging on the wall behind him... ...was his most prized possession, the Tablet of Ahkmenrah. Twenty-four-carat gold. It's worth a fortune. Very cool. It is indeed, Larry. Very cool. All right. Report here at 5 tomorrow. We'll walk you through your duties. Okay, 5. I'll be here. Moving on. Hey, it's me. So I got a job. Larry, that's great. What is it? It's a job... ...at the Museum of Natural History. Yeah, so you can tell Nicky that we won't be moving. Larry, this is good news. Yeah, no, definitely. So I'll see you tomorrow? - Okay. - Okay, bye. Larry? Your keys. Your torch. - Right. - You'll wanna strap those to your belt. It can get a little spooky around here at night... ...so you might wanna put a few lights on. All right, flashlight, keys. What am I for-- ? The instruction manual. Instructions. You start with one, two, three... Four? Are you cracking wise? I ought to punch you in the nose, hopscotch. Leave him alone, Gus. You got it covered, right, Larry? Yeah, yeah, I got it. - You better get it! - Gus. Larry, do them in order, do them all and do them quick. And the most important thing of all to remember: Don't let anything in or out. Out? Good luck, son. - Night, Gus. - Young buck. Cracking wise. Moving on. Hello? Hello! Check! Check. I am Larry. Check! Larry! Larry. Monday! Monday! Monday! Monster Truck Rally. Cecil? Okay, very funny, Cecil! What is this, like a David Copperfield thing? This is weird. Cecil? Come on. Revolve. Revolve! - Name, please? - Cecil... - ...Fredricks! - One moment. Connecting. - Hello. - Cecil! It's Larry Daley! Larry. Yes, how can I help you? The dinosaur-- The dinosaur is alive! I'm having a little trouble hearing you, friend. Tequila. The dinosaur's alive! What do I do? Tell me what to do! Read the instructions. It explains everything. Okay, I got them! - I'll see you tomorrow. - Wait! What-- ? What bone? Fetch? Play fetch? No way. - Dum-dum. - Yes? - You give me gum-gum. - I give you gum-gum? You new dum-dum. You give me gum-gum. Okay, you know what? I have no gum-gum. Sorry. And my name isn't dum-dum, my name's Larry. No, your name dum-dum. Oh, you in trouble, dum-dum. You'd better run-run from Attila the Hun-Hun. See you later, dum-dum. What is happening? Hey. How you doing? Are you...? You're... ...""Sakagahwahwaya""? You're ""Sakagawaya""? Oh, Sakagawea. You're Sakagawea? The glass. I can't... ...hear you. You can't...? You can't hear me? Excuse me. ""Who assisted the Lewis and Clark-- "" Right, so that's Lewis and Clark and you're... Right. You seem-- I'm Larry. What's going on? What's-- ? Do you know what's going on here? Huns. I gotta-- Hey. Hi. Tin Man. Hey. Hi. How you doing? I'm new. It says I'm supposed to lock up the lions or they'll eat me. You're Galileo? No? Okay... Hey, I'm the... Hi. I'm the new guy and I'm just locking up, so... If it's cool with you I'm just gonna get my paperwork... ...and be out of your hair, okay? ""Double-check your belt. The monkey probably stole your keys."" Monkey. Hey. Hey there. Hi. What's your name? Your name is... No, no, no. Come back. Come back. Dewey? Is that your name, Dewey? No, no, no. What's-- ? Dewey? Dexter? Dexter. Dexter, right? Hey, Dexter, you wanna give me those keys? I just want to lock up. Yes. Oh, good. Come to Papa. Oh, thank you. Can I have those keys? Oh, good. What a good boy. That's okay. Oh, thank you. Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. Thank you very, very much. Bad monkey. Stop that. That's not right. Are you done? Do you have an issue with me? Do you have an issue with me? Because if I have a problem with somebody, I don't pee on them, okay? And also-- Let me tell you something. These keys? Hey. Dexter, that's not funny. Give it back. Dexter. Give-- Don't. I know what you're thinking. Don't do it. Not a good idea. Not-- Dexter, I need those. Don't encourage him. You think you're funny for your friends, huh? You three guys-- What, he's the ringleader, you're the audience? Yeah, no. Don't do it, okay? Lookit-- You! Oh, this is not happening. Oh, man. What are you guys doing? I can't feel my lip. Oh, shit. Man. Hey. Hey. Hey, stop that. Hog-tie him, boys. - Get him, that big old Bocephus of a man. - Hey, what are you doing? Cinch him up good. You ain't so big now, are you? Hey. Hey, stop that. Every night, year after year... ...one of you guards locks us up in these boxes. Well, I hereby say, sir, enough! Fire up the iron horse, boys. - Hey, blondie? - Name's Jedediah. All right, Jedediah. Stop the train, please. - That's a big no-can-do, Cracker Jack. - What's going on here, huh? - Somebody's gotta pay. - Pay for what? I don't know. Just pay. Now, stop whining and just take it like a man. Seriously, stop the train. - All right, stop the train. - Thank you. Now full speed ahead and ram him! Split his head like a watermelon! For crying out loud. All right, that's enough. We got a breach. I got him. I got him. I got him, guys. I got him-- - Oh, my... - Prepare the catapults. Octavius, hold on. This ain't your fight. This here giant's on our land. Hey, little guy. Jed? Yeah. Sorry, look. I just-- I'm not a giant. I'm just an average-sized-- Don't talk down to me. I'm not a giant, guys. All right? You guys are really little. We may be small, but our hearts are large... ...metaphorically speaking. Don't take that wrong. I'm saying you're miniatures. Silence! The Roman Empire knows no boundaries. - Don't you do it, son. - Do what? - Octavius. - Don't do what? - Unleash hell! - Don't-- Climb aboard, boy. Take the hand, son. Onboard. That's right. You better run, boy. You hear Jedediah? That mustachioed horseman ain't always gonna be there to protect you, you hear me? - Thank you. - Not at all. Theodore Roosevelt, 26th president... ...of these United States of America at your service. Okay. I'm Larry Daley, the new night guard. Pleasure to me you, Lawrence Daley. You'll have to excuse me, though. The hunt is afoot. Hunt's afoot. Excuse me, Mr. President. Could I ask you something? - Yes, but just one question. - All right. Okay, why? Is it just some, like, three-wishes kind of deal, or-- ? Not at all. Self-reliance is the key to a vigorous life. A man must look inward to find his own answers. How can I be of help? I don't really know how to put this, and please don't take it the wrong way... ...but isn't everything in this museum supposed to be, you know... - ...dead? - Dead? - Yeah. - Follow me. Yell all you want, pharaoh. You've been in there 54 years. You're not getting out tonight. There's the source of all this commotion. The Tablet of Ahkmenrah. Arrived here in 1952 from the Nile expedition. On that night, everything in this museum came to life. And every night since. So everything in the museum comes to life every night? Exactly. And I'm supposed to do what? You're the night watchman, Lawrence. A venerable position in this institution. - Come on, lad. - All right. Okay. This is impossible. Nothing's impossible. If it can be dreamed, it can be done. Hence the 20-foot jackal staring at you. Don't make eye contact. Your job is to make sure that everyone stays inside the museum... ...because if the sun rises and anyone's on the outside... ...we turn to dust. - You turn to dust? - Dust. - Really? - Really. Now, it's almost dawn. I shall help you restore order tonight. But mark my words, it's the last time I shall ever do so. Is that clear? Yeah. I mean-- I mean, I guess. I don't... Stop babbling, boy! Yes or no? - Yes. - Good. Let's ride. All right. So the Hall of Reptiles is secure. What are you looking at? I'm tracking, dear boy. Man's got to track. Welcome to the family, Lawrence. See you tomorrow night. Actually, I gotta be honest. I don't think I'm coming back. What? You've only just begun. Yeah, well, this is not exactly what l-- - Lawrence? - Yeah? What did you do before you took this post? Well, I've done a lot of different things. I invented this thing called the Snapper. Did you give up on that as well? No, I just hit a few roadblocks. You might have heard of The Clapper? - Lawrence. - Yes, sir? Some men are born great. Others have greatness thrust upon them. For you, this is that very moment. Bully. Got you, boy. Yeah. You got me. Say hello to your little friend. - What are you doing? - Put me down. I don't like to be manhandled. - Just calm down, Jed. - lt doesn't feel good. - lt makes me feel small and powerless. - You done? I'm gonna shoot you in your dang eye. In your dadgum eye. Yeah, keep shooting. Nothing's gonna happen. Now you know my shame. Jedediah's impotent rage. His guns don't fire. Take me away. This ain't over. You ain't seen the last of me. I don't wanna hear it, okay? Duck! The bigger they are, the harder they fall. This is not worth 11.50 an hour. Look, the giant's scared. There's a bigger giant running around. Hello. Larry? Larry? Oh, don't do that. We're too old for surprises. Really? I thought you liked surprises. Like how you surprised me... ...with the fact everything in the museum comes to life at night. That little sweetheart. We wanted to tell you. You never would have believed us. - You have any idea what I've been through? - What? - You have any idea what I've been through? - Keep a lid on it, butterscotch. I don't know if what happened last night was real, but I didn't sign up for this. I just need a regular job that is not life-threatening and pays my bills. So thank you very much and I left my uniform in the office... - ...and I will be seeing you. - Larry! - Dad? - Hey. Hey, buddy. What are you guys doing here? Oh, Erica had to be in court early, so I'm taking Mr. Big Stuff here to school. But he wanted to swing by, see you in the new job. It's so awesome that you're working here. Hey, Niko, you wanna take a little look-a-doo inside? Maybe your dad will give you a VlP tour. You know what? We're pretty slammed this morning. Yeah, but Nicky, I promise, I'll show you around soon, okay? Deal? - Deal. - All right. - Bye, Dad. - Bye. - Love you. - Love you too, buddy. Bye, now. All right. Hey, Larry. So I was thinking maybe I'll give it one more night. I'm glad you came around. Welcome back. You. New night guard, here, now. - What's up? - ""What's up? "" Oh, well, take a walk with me and I'll show you, Mr. ""What's up? "" Come on. So would you kindly do me the favor of explaining this? Okay. I'm guessing-- And I'm just spitballing here, but looks like that Roman dude got cocky... ...and climbed over into the Wild West. And the cowboy knows Roman dude wants to take over his territory... ...so he rounded up a posse and put him in the stockade. ""Let's all laugh at me, the comedy night guard."" ""No"" is the answer. Sarcasm back at you, with your humor box. I wasn't laughing. Pretending to laugh... ...if that's what you want, some sort of battle of humor. Do you? No. I don't want-- No, I don't want a battle of humor. No, you don't, because it would be a bloodbath. Nothing funny about Little Bighorn. No. I find it about as funny as a ""fancist."" It's not funny. Okay? And I will not stand for this type of blatant... If I'm not clear, tell me. Am I clear? - Yeah. - Yeah? Hey, Cecil? You got an extra copy of that instruction manual? Oh, no. I'm afraid not, Larry. Listen, I'll tell you what you do. Read some books. Brush up on your history. Helped me a lot when I first started out. This museum was originally dedicated to that man on the horse up there... ...President Theodore Roosevelt. He absolutely loved history and believed that the more you know about the past... ...the better prepared you are for the future. Okay, kids. Who can tell me what this room's called? Very good. The Hall of African Mammals. Right here we have the king of the jungle, the lion. Up ahead is one of my favorite creatures in the whole museum, the capuchin monkey. A highly intelligent primate known for its loving and generous nature. Excuse me? I just thought that was... I just was laughing in agreement. Happy monkey. All right, kids. This way. Let me tell you something. I'm not buying it. You might have them fooled, you might have the kids fooled. Not me. Can't get past me. There's a storm coming, buddy. There's a storm coming. One of the most famous trackers in history, Sakagawea was the woman... ...who led Lewis and Clark on their expedition to find the Pacific Ocean. You guys have heard the saying, ""Actions speak louder than words."" And yet they wrote-- - Yes, Mr. Daley? - Yes. Was she deaf? Was she deaf? No. She was not. But she-- Yeah, because-- Just-- She does seem a little bit sort of unresponsive. That's because she's a statue. Kids, could you give me one sec? Go check her out. She's really cool. - What are you doing? - I'm gonna be here every night. I wanted to learn a little bit more about what I'm guarding. Actually, I've got a bunch of questions. Maybe when you have a break, could I buy you a cup of coffee? A cup of coffee? Yeah, I mean, just purely a, you know... ...colleague-to-colleague, information-download sort of coffee. I finish in 20 minutes. I'll meet you outside. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - And have a good rest of your-- - All right. Okay, kids. It was incredible what she did. She literally led these men across rivers, up mountains... ...all with her newborn baby on her back. She was the ultimate working mother. Wow, you are quite the Sakagawean expert. - Sakagawean. - Sakagawean? Yeah. I should be, I've been writing my dissertation on her for four years. You've been working on one paper for four years? That would drive me crazy. Actually, it's more like a 900-page book. So, what's your story? Have you always wanted to be a security guard? - Oh, I didn't mean to-- - No, no, no. No, I'm divorced and I have a 10-year-old son... ...so I needed to find a more steady situation. Got it. So, what can I tell you about the museum? Okay, Attila the Hun. What is that guy's problem? Attila was considered the only genuine threat to the Roman Empire. "" Known as the 'Scourge of God'... ...Attila and his Huns would often tear off the limbs of their helpless victims. Attila was famous for his superstitious beliefs. He surrounded himself with a phalanx of sorcerers and magicians... ...who advised and mystified him with their dark arts."" Larry? Just wanted to say good luck, son. And goodbye. We're clocking out for the last time. If you're ever in Boca, look us up. Wait, you guys are going out of town? What if this doesn't work out? Smart fellow like you? You'll be fine. Yeah. We'll just be a phone call away. Come on, walk us out. You fellas go ahead. I need a moment. He's very emotional. A lot of memories in this room. Go crazy, big guy. Hey, guys. Quest for fire... ...over. Knock yourselves out. Morning, dum-dum. Me no dum-dum. You dum-dum. You bring me gum-gum? Yes, I did, fathead. Lots and lots of gum-gum. What's that? I can't hear you through the glass. Sorry. Heave. Heave. Heave. Hey, what's going on over here? We expand or we die. Heave. - Heave. - On the count of three... ...you blow this anthill to kingdom come. - And a one and a two-- - Hey, Jed. Stop that. No, no. You blow a hole in your mountain, all you're gonna hit is a wall. Step aside, Gigantor. We got us a railroad to build. We're blowing a hole in that thing. Okay, first of all, enough with the Gigantor giant stuff, okay? - I'm just trying to close up shop. - We're gonna blow it anyway. And a three! Yeah. What are you doing? What's it look like we're doing? It's manifest destiny. You can't fight it and neither can l. Go! More dynamite. - Yeah, use it all. - All right. Okay. Listen, ""Octavus""? You gotta stop that. It's Octavius, mary. Okay, you know what? Fine. Great. Here you go. This is what happens. - You cannot do this. I am a Roman general. - Sorry. - I have rights. - And you. - Hey, no! Put me down! - Keep heaving, men. You can't stop progress! We're gonna have a little talk, okay? I told you, I don't like to be manhandled. No, I will manhandle you, Jedediah. Now, listen, guys. What is your problem, huh? Why can't you just get along? Look, we're men. We fight, okay? That's what we do. It's kind of how we pass the time. You're, like, a giant. A freak, if you will. We can't expect you to understand that. You got the whole room to run around in. You don't have to be near each other. - What, you mean...? - You're gonna let us out? What, and just roam free? Yeah. Yeah, I might, if you promise to behave. That means no fireballs, no explosions, okay? You have my word, my liege. Yeah, no problemo, Gigantor. My name's Larry, first of all. Okay, Jed? So I call you Jed. I don't call you Tiny, right? What's that supposed to mean? - ""Hey, Teeny."" How does that sound? - I don't like it. It hurts my feelings. ""Gigantor"" makes me feel like some sort of freak, so... I don't. I just call you Larry. Don't be a kiss-ass, okay? Look, I'm trusting you guys, all right? If you don't do what I say, you can end up like the Mayan world there. Locked up. Take a look. - Do they look happy? - No. They look sad. They can't do what they wanna do. Now, I'm letting you guys... ...have a little bit of leash here. Don't choke me with it, okay? I gotta run. You guys play nice, okay? Okay. Good. Thanks. Hey, how's that gum treating you, dum-dum? Good. Oh, hey, Dexter. I'm just locking up. You want in? Yeah? All right. What's that? You got my keys? I don't think so. Looks like Uncle Larry pulled a fast one on little Dexie. Those are baby keys for a little baby. Have fun with your baby keys, little baby monkey. Tomorrow I'll bring you a little baby diapy so you can go poo-poo in it. I'll give you a tickle because you're a cute baby. While you cry all night long about how Uncle Larry fooled you, huh? I told you there was a storm coming. - Hey, Teddy. - Lawrence. You impertinent pup. I knew you'd come back. - You look like a man on a mission. - Yeah, I'm gonna give it another shot. - You...? - What? - You checking her out? - The nerve. Checking her out. I've never heard of such a thing. No, no, no. I'm just-- I mean because, you know, she's very beautiful. - Beautiful? - Yeah. - Rather handsome woman, I suppose. - Yeah. I don't know, maybe you should go talk to her. - lndeed. Bless you, lad. - Yeah. All right. - Carry on. - Good. See you. I... Hey, hi. No! It's okay! It's okay. You guys speak English? No? Right. I don't know what that means... ...and I know that you and I got off on the wrong foot last night, but... ...a little birdie told me that somebody likes... ...magic. - Magic? - Magic. Sorcery. Ah, sorcer-- Yes. Illusion. Everybody likes magic. And flowers. People like flowers. There you go. Those are for you. You know what else people like? Money. The almighty dollar, right? But money can sometimes... ...disappear. At least that's what l... ...hear. No wonder you can't understand me. You got a coin in your ear. Check this out. Anybody need a hanky? Well, I wouldn't suggest this little feller because he has a nasty habit... ...of vanishing... ...into thin air! No, no. Don't. That defeats the-- Don't! Not the limbs. Guys, please, do not tear the limbs. Cortes, right? How? You! Don't even think about it. Don't you-- Dexter! Come on, guys! Hey, guys! Hey, guys. Hey, guys! Sorry. What's going on? What happened here? I thought we had a deal. We will never coexist with these buffoons. We're past words, Laredo. Now it's time to let Smith & Wesson do the talking! Those guns don't even work. They don't? Take a look at this. Dexter! Why? Ho! Dexter. End of the line, cool breeze. End of the line. I am not playing games here. Just hand them over. Easy. That's it, Dexter. Nice and easy, Dex. That's it. Good Lord, Lawrence! Why are you slapping a monkey? Teddy, this guy's been pushing me, and I'm sick of it! Poppycock. This little creature is your primate brother. Without him, there's no us. Are you rabid? Wipe that off. You have to deal with this creature with love and respect. May I have the keys, dear friend? Thank you. Lawrence? Well, you know what? You seem to know what you're doing, so I'm gonna let you take over. No, no. My dear boy, you can't put up the white flag now. The museum is on the verge of total anarchy. I tried! I came back tonight, didn't l? Tried? That was one night. I didn't build the Panama Canal in one day. That's great, but I'm dealing with the most ridiculous job in history. Some men are born great, Lawrence-- Yeah, I know. Others have greatness thrust upon them. You hit me with that chestnut last night. The thing is, not everyone is great. That's the problem. Some of us are just ordinary. No, you're not, Lawrence. Stop wallowing in self-pity. Every journey begins with a footstep. Teach the inhabitants to get along, they wouldn't need to be locked up. That means a lot coming from a guy who's spent the last 50 years... ...spying on a girl he's never even talked to. I was going to make contact. Lawrence, please. I'm done, all right? No, Rexy! No! Oh, no. All right. No one comes here anymore. Besides, I took this tour in second grade, Daley. I'm telling you, my dad's gonna hook us up. - Mr. Daley? - Yeah? - Foam. - Yes, I know. In the Neanderthal display. There was an incident last night with the fire extinguisher. I was on my way to go clean it up. Okay, don't bother. You're fired. I don't think we're getting a tour today. Your dad just got canned, dude. Excuse me? Mr. McPhee? Excuse me, Mr. McPhee? Can I talk to you about this, please? - Sir? - What? I know I screwed up, but I finally understand how to do this job. - You obviously don't. - No, I didn't, but now I do. - Really, Mr. McPhee-- - Doctor. Dr. McPhee. Can you please give me one more night? - One more night. - Okay, thank you. And if anything is the tiniest... ...after your shift: Because... - Got it. - Okay? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... Shame on me. Fool me-- Shame on me. - You. - Fool me twice... Got it. - Take it or leave it. - Okay. Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. - What's wrong? - Maybe you should ask Nicky. Hey, buddy. What's going on? You got fired. What are you talking about? I didn't get fired. I came to the museum this morning. I saw your boss yelling at you. Why didn't you tell me? Everything's fine. We just had a little misunderstanding. Why? It's hard to explain. I mean, you wouldn't bel-- You know what? Let me show you. - Show me what? - Come to work with me tonight. Larry? Can I talk to you for a second? Am I in trouble? Larry, what are you doing? I just wanna show him what I do. That's all. I love that you wanna share that with him, but I gotta tell you... ...I don't think Nicky has any room in his heart for more disappointment. He won't be disappointed. Larry. He won't be disappointed. Listen, hang out in the security office till everyone's gone. Then I'm gonna come get you. All right? Hey, miss? I'm gonna have to ask you to vacate the premises. - Hey there. - Hey. - Good place to think, huh? - Yeah. Definitely. So no big plans tonight? Yeah, no, I'm not really a big-plan person. I prefer hanging out with people who are dead for 200 years. It's the live ones that throw me. That's cool. Seriously though, you do have to leave. - Seriously? - Yeah, sorry. It's museum rules. We're sort of locking everything up. You're really taking your job seriously. You know, once I clip on the tie, I'm all business. - I get it. - Yeah. How's that dissertation coming? I've hit a dead end. I mean, research can only get me so far. I'm never gonna know who she really was. So I think it's time that I move on to another subject. I'll let you get back to work. - Good night, Larry. - Yeah, okay. Night. Hey. Rebecca! - Hey, Rebecca. - Hey. Hey. Listen, I don't think you should give up on your paper. Okay. Why? All right, look, this is gonna sound crazy, all right? I mean, it's gonna sound, like, really, really crazy. - Okay. - No, I mean insanely crazy. - I can handle it. - Okay. You know how they say in certain museums, history comes alive? - Yeah. - ln this museum... ...it actually does. What are you talking about? Everything in this museum comes to life at night. - Really? - Yeah, really. I'm not kidding you. You know that tablet? The Tablet of Ahkmenrah? It actually brings things to life. It's like some ancient spell. Since the '50s, every night everything's been coming to life. Teddy Roosevelt told me. Seriously. The monkey, Dexter? The cute little-- - What is he? - Capuchin. A capuchin. Right. The capuchin. He urinated on me and bit my nose. And Sakagawea is in her case, alive every night... ...just listening to Lewis and Clark argue. So if you really wanna get inside her head... ...I can hook that up. That's cool. Yeah, it's cool. It's freaking awesome. Make fun of the history geek. - No. Rebecca! - Good night, Larry. No, I'm not making fun of you. Rebecca. - Here you go. Best seat in the house. - What's going on? If I told you, you'd think I'm crazy. I'm gonna show you. - What? - You'll see in about 20 seconds. - Okay, you like Tyrannosaurus Rex? - Yeah. Yeah? Well, I call him Rexy. And he's about to come to life, Nicholas, in... ...five, four, three, two... - Dad? - Hang on a sec. Say hello to Rexy! Dad, are you okay? This is weird. Guys! Come on! Sundown! Hey, T.R., come on, rise and shine. Buddy, I need you to wake up. Come on, my kid is here. I need you to wake up. Texas? Texas! Come on! Texas! Come on! Get on, Texas! Get on, Texas! Get up. Just stop, okay? No, Nicky, I'm telling you, there's this tablet, okay? Called the Tablet of Ahkmenrah. Every night-- - Now there's a tablet? - Yeah, there is. Come on, Dad. Come on. - It's gone. - What's gone? The tablet. I think somebody stole it. Yeah, right. I'm not kidding, Nicky. Nicky? Hey, Nicky! Hey! Hey, Nicky! Where are you going? - Home. - What? Wait a minute. Come on. You guys shouldn't be here. Give us the tablet, son. Wait a minute, Nicky. What are you guys doing? We're not gonna hurt you. Give us the tablet. I'm sorry to tell you this, son, but your dad doesn't work here. He got fired this morning. Couldn't hack it. Dad? I thought you said you weren't fired. I did. They're lying, trying to steal that thing. Turn the middle piece, you'll see what I was talking about. That is museum property, son. Give it back. Nicky, trust me. Just turn it. - Give us the tablet! - Nicky? Trust me. Nick? Run. Now. Get back here, kid! Bad idea, Larry. You wanna dance, hot dog? You wanna dance? Gus, you're an old man. I don't wanna hurt you. You see, Larry, a few years into the job, the three of us realized that... ...Iike everything else in this museum, we got new life at night. Sundown to sunrise, we felt young again. Okay. Did not see that coming. Gave us an energy boost. We love the nightlife, Larry. So when we found out they were gonna fired us... ...we had to steal the tablet. Everyone knows you need the money. Add the stuff we planted in your place... ...pretty obvious you committed the crime. Take care of that cut. Come on, guys, let's go find that kid. - Sweet dreams, cupcake! - No! Pile driver! Let's get our tablet. Thank you very much. We'll take it from here. Nicky! Just in time, Larry. We were just locking up. Sleep tight, hotshot. Let's grab everything we can fence. I don't know about you, but I'm planning on a long retirement. Teddy! Teddy, if you're out there, I need you, pal! Someone call my name? Theodore Roosevelt, at your service. Teddy, can you get us out of here? Can't do it, man. This is your moment. Will you save the lectures, please? I'm not you. Okay? I didn't build the Panama Canal, I wasn't president of the United States! I need some help. Come on. Actually... ...I never did any of those things. Teddy Roosevelt did. I was made in a mannequin factory in Poughkeepsie. I never shot a wild beast. I'm not even brave enough to tell that beautiful woman I love her. But you... ...you gotta finish the job this time. You can't quit. I'm made of wax, Larry. What are you made of? - Wait! That's all you got for me? - That's it! That's it. Come on. Duck! Go over there! Hey. Hi. How you doing? Sorry to bother you... ...but your guys there? Your jackal guys? Do you think you could ask them to back off, please? We're not trying to hurt you, they think we are. Could you do it like now? Thank you. Nicky. Thank you. Dad? You would not believe how stuffy it is in there. - How come you speak English? - I went to Cambridge University. You went to Cambridge? I was on display in the Egyptology Department. I am Ahkmenrah, fourth king of the fourth king... ...ruler of the land of my fathers. I am Larry... ...son of Milton... ...and this is my son, Nick. And we hail from Brooklyn. Well, I do. I mean, he comes out and stays with me on Wednesdays... ...and every other weekend. That was the custody agreement that we had. Larry, Nick, guardians of Brooklyn... ...I am forever in your debt. Now bestow the tablet upon me... ...so that I may assume command of my kingdom. Oh, yes. Okay, the tablet. I would... ...Iove to bestow it upon you, but we don't actually... ...have it. Thanks, guys. Don't worry. I'll watch out for him! Thank you. What is that? Huns. I gotta deal with this guy. Pardon me, Larry. I speak Hun. He says that he wants to rip you apart. All right. Again with the ripping. Listen, I understand. I get it. Ripping for you... You want to rip things, okay? And I think maybe that's because somebody ripped you a long time ago. In here. Somebody ripped little... ...baby Attila a long time ago, right here. They ripped something out, didn't they? They ripped the love. They ripped the love right out of you, didn't they? A little baby all alone in a tent... ...whose daddy went off... ...to pillage some town... ...or go and plunder somewhere, just doing his job. But who was left alone? You. Let it out. Let it go. Let it go. It's okay. It's okay. You're next. Good. That's good. Just breathe. - Larry Daley. - Yeah. Good. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Good, good. All right! I need everybody to listen up! Guys! Come on! Quiet! My dum-dum want to speak. Thank you. Now, this here's King Ahkmenrah. His tablet is what brings you to life every night. And those old night watchmen? They stole it. Now, we need to find those guards and get the tablet back... ...and we need to do it before morning. Civil War guys, head over to the Planetarium Wing. My explorer friend whose name escapes me. - It's Columbus. - Right, Columbus! Right, I'm sorry. There's no nameplate, so... Columbus, take the Neanderthals... ...and do a sweep from lnvertebrates all the way through Reptiles. Jed and Octavius, their van's parked out back. Go take care of it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, no! No, sir. I ain't working with toga boy. Romans work alone. - That didn't hurt. Don't be a baby. - Yes, it did. Come on. That was much harder! Guys, come on! Jed, Octavius. Take away the fact you were born 2000 years apart... ...you guys aren't that different. You're both great leaders. You just want what's best for your people, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Civil War dudes. You guys are brothers, for God's sakes. You gotta stop fighting. North wins. Slavery's bad. Sorry. Don't wanna burst your bubble. But, South, you guys get Allman Brothers... ...and NASCAR, so just chill! Look, without that tablet, all of this... ...this whole coming-to-life-at-night thing, it all goes away. Now, I don't wanna let that happen, but I need your help. We can get this done, but we gotta do it together. So who's with me? Yeah. - Who's with me? - Yeah! - Yeah! - Charge! All right! Now, let's do this, people! And animals! And weird, faceless puppet creatures. Come on, let's go! Let's do it! Come on! Follow me, boys! Geronimo! Oh, jeez. Now, boys, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. I guess it's gonna be the hard way. Right, men, we're almost there. Save yourself! I ain't quitting you! Gus? Reginald? Fellas, where are you? Guys? That's what I'm talking about. Good job, gentlemen. Loving the teamwork! They've vanished. How will we find them? I know someone who can help. Come on. Watch out! Hey, Sakagawea, or wea. Listen, I need a favor. Somebody stole his tablet. You think you can track the guys who took it? He went east but he lost control and crashed. You're amazing. How can you tell that? He left the wagon... ...and went back. He went back? Why would he go back? Get out of the way! You saved me. You're worth saving, my dear. - That's problematic. - Teddy. Oh, man. Larry, relax. I'm wax. You gotta do something. Dawn's approaching. - Half the museum's running amuck outside. - He's got my tablet. Come on, Ockie! At your service, Gigantor! How can we be of assistance, my liege? Just give me a second, guys. Rexy? Here, boy. Teddy, I need a horse. Do it, man. - Come on, boy! Let me hear you yell! - Yeah! Just living the dream, baby! I'm loving this! Pull the stagecoach over now! Can I make this turn up here? I'll take that as a yes. Hang on! I can't hold it! Come on, Tex, let's finish this. Come on! Give me the tablet, Cecil! Can't do it, son. Pull over! It ain't gonna happen. Moving on. Last chance, Cecil. Stop the horses or I will! They can't be stopped, Larry. Don't you know your history? These are money carriers. They were trained not to stop for anything but a secret word. Really? You mean a word like... ..."" Dakota""? Come on, Tex. I read up on my history. Thanks for the tip. Oh, and by the way... ...don't ever talk to me like that in front of my son. Moving on. - Hey, Huns. - Tell Attila to have his boys... ...take him back. Put him with the guards. Oh, and no limb ripping, okay? Hey, boy. Wait, wait, hold the phone. What's makeekaka mean? Wait. Translation, please. The year was 1909. I was going up the Zambezi River in Africa. And our river guide was a brilliant Pygmy who spoke only by clicking. There we are. - Oh, boy. - What is it? I gotta get you guys back to the museum. How? Ahkmenrah, I'm gonna need your help. This is your tablet. You know the instructions. You get everyone back. Come on. There's somebody who's gotta see this. What I'm saying is, for the type of money that they pay A-Rod... ...he ought to be bringing home a World Series trophy every season. You know what I mean? Now, who they gonna get to clean up all that doo-doo? - lnuit. - Yeah. One terracotta soldier. - Vikings. - Right. - Alpaca. - Welcome back, ladies. - Llama. - Hey. Viking guys. Do me a favor. Your fellows made some funeral pyre... ...in Petrified Wood. Go clean that up. Okay? Thank you. - He's back. - All right, I'll deal with this joker. Hey, hey, Moose. It's not gonna happen, buddy. All right? I told you, you can't come through with those antlers. So you and your caribou buddy gotta go around to the loading dock. - Lawrence! - Hey, Teddy. Great to see you in one piece. Sakagawea, a little hot wax, and I'm a new man. Larry? I told you I wasn't making fun of you. - I know. - Teddy? Oh, my God. Wanna meet her? - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, come on. Excuse me. President Roosevelt, this is my friend Rebecca. - An honor. - Hi. And this is Sakagawea. - Wea. - Wea. Wea. I think she has a few questions she wants to ask you. You rock. I am a big fan. What would you like to know? Well, I mean, I don't know where to start, but... - One Buddha. - Check. Two zebras. - Right. Check. - Dexter! Welcome back. Hey, Dex, so look. No hard feelings, all right? - Lawrence! - You saw! - You saw what he did just then! - Who's evolved? - I am. - Who's evolved? I am! Good. Well, they're all here. Well done. Everyone's in. Yeah, well... ...not everyone. We lost a couple of good, little men out there tonight. With great victory comes great sacrifice. Yeah. Dad, look. Bully! You ain't getting rid of us that easy. Until tomorrow evening, Lawrence? Yeah. I don't know about that, Teddy. It's gonna be tough to talk my way out of this one. Well, if that's indeed the case... ...then it's farewell, my friend. Nick? Your father's a great man. I know. Told you. All right. Good night. No, Lawrence. Good day. Hey, Teddy? Thanks. You're watching New York 1. News all morning. Thanks for joining us. There is a fresh blanket of snow. But it's not the snow that's got New Yorkers talking. It's what's in the snow. There are dinosaur tracks along West 81st Street. Here's the remarkable video. These appear to be Tyrannosaurus Rex tracks... ...and they lead straight to the Museum of Natural History. Authorities have found what appear to be cave drawings in the subway. Neanderthals atop the museum roof. Elaborate hoax or publicity stunt? You be the judge, but one thing's for sure: The folks at the Natural History Museum have really outdone them-- Any explanation at all? No. Got nothing. Good. I'll take your keys and your flashlight. Folks, this way. My name is Nick Daley. My Career Day parent is my dad. He's the night watchman at the Museum of Natural History. Hey, how's it going? Well, Nicky said it: I'm the night watchman at the Museum of Natural History. Let me tell you something: That's when history comes alive. How many of you guys have been over to the museum? Goal! Hey, it's getting late. Are you ready to go home? Nope. Let's ride. It was nice of Larry not to rat us out, but this is ridiculous. We're night watchmen, not janitors! Gentlemen, you're doing a terrific job. I'll gonna catch a few Z's. You ain't going nowhere. Start mopping, hot dog. Over here., Good morning, beauty. Let's go, or we'll never leave on time. I'm totally ready. Come on. I'll make you some waffles. - Mother.... - Caitlin. Blueberries! Hey, Cooper. You want some breakfast too? You want some waffles? Good boy. Look. They're at it again. Christ, that's twice in.... When did they move in? Three weeks. What's their name? Feur, I think. Psych department. Figures, they're all nuts. She's awake. We'll be quiet. Quick and quiet. I don't want to be either. - When's she out of here? - Norman Spencer! All right, I can't stand the rejection. I'm going for a run. Hey, you okay? Yeah. Come on, Pooper. Let's go. We'll have to leave by 11 if we want to beat the traffic. Eleven o'clock. You know, you can call me... ...whenever you want. Sweetheart... ...I've known this day was coming for a long time. I have Norman, and the garden and the new house. You really don't have to worry. - I'm just saying-- - Really. Okay. Mom? Mom? Mother? I have to go. Honey, if I don't get you out of here quick, they'll make you enroll. - I'll call you. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Come home often. Call your mom. - Beatrice, it's nice to meet you. - Bye. - You take care of each other. - I won't go to a bar without her. I'm just kidding. Bye. Well, I almost made it. What are you reading? ""Genetic Repair Mechanisms in Eukaryotic Organisms."" Eukaryotic. How is it? Excellent. Oh, a couple of... ...Swedish sailor cells just gang- divided a virginal cheerleader cell. Almost there. - If you have to work.... - No, no. Just let me get this. Okay, almost. There. How's it going? Great. I think we cracked it. The prenatal thing? Yeah, I targeted repair. You are so brilliant. Yep. Madame Curie, Jonas Salk... ...Norman Spencer. Yes! How are you? - I'm fine. - Yeah? I am. Yeah, really. It's okay if you're not, you know. To tell you the truth, I'm... ...excited. Really? Yeah, I'm gonna get my life back. Get some time for myself. Some time for us. Did a great job. She's a good kid. We did. Just us now. I know. Tired? Nope. Want to fool around? Yep. Jesus. What is he doing to her? - I guess they're making up. - Wait. Leave it open. Think we can take 'em? It's worth a try. Do the brilliant Norman stuff some more. And speak up. Oh. Hello? Ouch! Ow! Hello? Mrs. Feur? Hello? Are you all right? He's so.... It's too much... ...and I can't.... I can't breathe. And I'm afraid. What? What are you afraid of? That one day I'll just... ...disappear. Is there something I can do? Can I...? I've never even met you. I know. I'm sorry. I've been consumed. This fence... ...it's so.... I'm sorry. Listen, would you like to come over for coffee, or--? Oh, God, he's back. I'm sorry. Please forget what I said. I don't even know you! Please! She sounded... - ...terrified. - Of what? Of him, I think. Did she say that? More or less. I want to go over there. Let's go and-- - Why? - To see if she's all right-- Honey, we're not going to march over to our new neighbors and accuse them-- - That's not what I'm suggesting. - Especially since they'll keep us up... ...with their sexual olympics. What if something happened to her? - Nothing will happen. - I'd never forgive.... Honey, people argue. People fight. It's not our business. - I've got to work tonight. - I know. This conference is the first big preview of my paper. I've just got to stay focused a little while longer. This is what I've been working for. I just wish you could have heard her. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll call Harvey Tomes tomorrow in the psych department... ...and I'll see what I can find out about him. Promise? Yeah, I promise. Hey, lady! What are you doing? Looking for you. What are you doing? Just trying to drop off this welcome thing for the new neighbors. Not home? Guess not. - You are so good at this. - If I were, I'd have done it weeks ago. I gave my neighbors wine that someone left at my house. - Are you staying? - Just came by to see how you're doing. Good. I'm good. Are you? Why does everyone find that so surprising? Because your only daughter just left for college... ...who you're extremely close with. I'd be tripping. Oh, right. You had a hell of a year too. The move, the new house... ...the garden. The car. A minor setback. Was that a year ago? This week. Wow. Now Caitlin. Big stress stuff. Okay. I'm a little tender. Good. You're human. And so far this week, my big task is to take pictures of my roses... ...for the garden club. Got here just in time, didn't I? Brought you something. It's Kambucha mushroom tea. It soothes heartache and promotes psychic wellness. - Floriana suggested it. - So you discuss me with your psychic? No, and she's not really a psychic. Just an enlightened spirit. Like me. That's worse. You're gossiping about me. Notice anything different? Oh, my God. You bought it! Yep. Nice. It's a beautiful thing, alimony. You lose a husband... ...get a car. - Think it'll help me pick up dudes? - Absolutely. Cool. I have to run. You take care. Thanks for the tea. Norman. Norman. - Norman! - What? Come here. You have to see this. - What's the matter? - Look. What, Claire? I thought I saw.... - I-- - What? - I thought I saw something. - Jesus Christ! Ow. Hi, is Caitlin there? Any idea when she'll be back? You be sure to tell her I called? Thanks, Beatrice. Well, that's a first. Cooper, come on. Get your ball. What's the matter? Cooper, it's your favorite ball. - Hello? - Hi. I'm stuck here for another couple of hours. Sorry. Unless you want me to come home? No. No, it's fine. You sure? Claire? Huh? Oh, absolutely. Take your time. See you soon. Love you. Love you. Bye. Cooper! Cooper! Fine. Have it your way. We use different kinds. Now we're using halothane. Halothane? Is that a sedative? It's a dissociative. It paralyzes motor function but leaves her conscious. She can't move but knows what's going on. - Hi, Mrs. Spencer. - Hi, Teddy. - How long does that last? - Five minutes. - Sometimes three. - Can it be used on all mammals? Yeah, any procedure where you want to get the patient immobile, pain-free. - Hey. - Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? - Are you okay? - I.... I heard noises. - What kind of noises? Where? - At the house. I was scared. - Did you call the police? - No. I'll have the police check on the house while I'm gone. Oh, great. ""Could you check in on my wife? She's hearing voices."" Wait till that gets around. I'll be in New Haven for the conference. I want you to feel safe. I do. I'm sure it was just... ...nothing. Did you call about the Feurs? Oh, yeah. Harvey says the guy's harmless. Wouldn't hurt a flea. Warren. Warren Feur. What about her? I know he told me.... Oh. I met Schumway today. Who wrote that book you love. They were doing some spiel for the chemistry department... ...so Bob Shine introduces us. You'll love this. He looks right at me... ...and congratulates me on Spencer's Theorem. He didn't know your father was dead? He knew. Oh, Norman. What? You're so sensitive about that. - No, I'm not. - You are. You always overreact. I'll have to watch that, won't I? Was it Mary? Mrs. Feur. Warren and Mary? Yeah. Mary. That's it. I'm gonna do some work. Hello? Mrs. Feur? Can I help you? Oh, yes. Hi. I'm Claire Spencer, from next door. Nice to meet you. I wanted to stop by and welcome you to the neighborhood. Thank you, but this really isn't a good time. I'm running late. Is your wife home? No, she isn't. When will she be back? I have to go. I'm sorry. It was nice to meet you. What's he doing? Eating dinner. Alone. TV dinner. That's bad. That's my shiatsu guy. Listen, call me back if he starts in on some serial-killer dessert... ...like ladyfingers. - You got it. - Bye. Where did you go? Shit! Jesus, Claire. - What the hell are you doing? - I was looking-- - Spying. - Spying on Mr. Feur. - How come you're not dressed? - Dressed? Dinner with Stan. - Tonight? - Tonight. - We're going to be-- - Fashionably five minutes late. Are you saying he murdered his wife? Is that so ridiculous? She was terrified... ...and now she doesn't answer the door, but her car's in the garage. Maybe she was out, or in bed with the flu. - Or maybe she was abducted by aliens. - Who are you calling? - Restaurant. - We're not at the center of the bridge. You can't get service until the center. I know we're not at the center. There. See? Well, that's a relief. Hi, Stan. Hey, Claire. Norman. - Sorry we're late. - It's my fault. We just got here. - Where's the new squeeze? - Here I am. - This is-- - Elena? Oh, my God. Claire! I don't believe it! - This is-- - We know each other. - Norman. - Hello, Norman. How do you do? Claire, look at you! You look beautiful. Here was this brilliant conductor in purple bikini briefs... ...with no bangs... ...cursing his ass off in Finnish. Oh, Claire. I made an honest woman of her. How long have you been in Vermont? Oh, well, Norman grew up here. Remember Beau Flynn, head of cardio at the hospital? He was just sacked. I just dropped her off at college. He was involved in some stalking incident. An intern, some girl. We're getting so old! They don't screw around with that anymore. - When did we last get together? - New York. - Of course. Right after-- - Right after Michael died. - Michael who? - Marlov. Claire's first husband. - Oh, the musician. - Yeah. You know, we all toured together. Have you heard her play? No. No, I.... I would sit on-stage... ...during Claire's solo... ...and I mean, truly, I had tears streaming down my face. I mean, she's fabulous. So why did you stop? Oh.... Well, one night, after a concert... ...I met a dashing, handsome... ...genius scientist... ...and three months later, I was married. Is that when you guys moved up to Vermont? No, we were living in Boston... ...when Norman was offered a position. A position. The DuPont Chair in genetics. I see. So now you're teaching at your father's school here. I actually don't... ...do much teaching anymore. I run a research project. Oh. Norman's father had this old stuffy-- --stately place on a lake. - Which we're renovating. - Practically gutted. - No, we didn't. - Yes, we did. ""Gutted."" - Wait till you see it. It's beautiful. - It is beautiful. You'll see it. It's haunted. No. Is it really? Claire's hearing things. What? What are you hearing? I, um.... I don't know. I heard... ...voices, whispering.... A picture fell. You know, I completely believe in all that. You do? I do. Wait a minute. Who do you think it is? I know exactly who it is. It's my old man. He's pissed about us dicking around with the house. Ow. Claire. Jesus.... It's all right. Calm down, Claire. It's okay. Whose idea was it? Mine. His. We both thought.... I didn't want to come here. - Then why did you? - He was worried about me. - Your husband? - Yes. I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of Prozac or lithium... ...so he can live out his life in peace. - Do you really think so? - No. Are you on medication? No. Well, Valium. For sleeping. Having trouble sleeping? Sometimes. When I get anxious. Do you get anxious only at night? No, I only take Valium at night. For sleeping. Why do you get anxious? I don't know. Why do you think your husband's worried? Because.... I don't know. Because ever since Caitlin left-- Ever since my daughter left for school... ...there have been.... I've been.... Why is this so hard? Here. Have a fireball. Thank you. It's hard because I'm a complete stranger... ...and you're talking about incredibly personal things. Besides, most people, when they come the first time, are wondering... ...if I think they're crazy. Don't worry. I'm required... ...to have three sessions before I can commit. That was a joke. These are good. They're hot. There's a ghost in my house. I saw her in the water, beside me... ...in the bathtub. What does she look like? She looked like... ...me. Oh. Only she had green eyes. Any idea who she is? Maybe. But I'd rather not say just yet. Fine. What do you think I should do? Try to contact her. Communicate with her somehow. Find out what she wants. What do you want me to do? Go buy a Ouija board? Ah. Are we hoping the ghost will have to use the potty? This is where she was. This is where I... ...saw her. That makes sense. - Where did you finally find one? - Kmart. I think we're supposed to sit in a protective circle, aren't we? What's that for? - Where did you get it? - Never mind. You stole her shoe. You have to have something of the dead woman's. Says who? Is that blood on it? I don't know. Just place your fingers on the message indicator. Okay. We wish to commune... ...with the spirit-- What? ""Wish to commune."" - Forget it. - What? No, this whole thing is insane. I'm sorry. What's her first name? Mary. Feur. Mary Feur, Mary Feur.... Mary Feur.... We wish to communicate... ...with the spirit of Mary Feur. - Not much happening. - Shh. What was that? It's flickering. Yeah. - Did you see that? - Yeah. Cooper! Listen... ...about our little sance. Norman doesn't need to know. - I won't tell if you won't. - It's just that... ...ever since the accident... ...he treats me like I'm this... ...fragile, loopy.... Well, I am seeing ghosts in the bathtub, aren't I? You did wrap your car around a tree doing, like, 80. He was pretty shaken up. - We all were. - It was an accident. A year ago. I'm fine. Right? Of course you are. You're just not much of a medium, however. I'll call you tomorrow. Get some rest. Did you pick up any dudes yet? I have one in the trunk. Bye. What do you want? She's dead. - Who's dead? - You know damn well who's dead. The Feur thing. Listen to me. He killed her and I'm not crazy. Jody and I had a sance in the bathroom, and nothing happened... ...but when I went back there she was there. She was. Wait a minute. You had a sance? - Are you angry with me? - What? - Maybe you resent how busy I've been. - No. You know what I've got at stake for this paper. How important it is to me. I can't help feeling that you're trying to sabotage me, to hurt me. Norman, this isn't about you. Something is happening to me. And it's not to get even, and it's not some warped bid for attention. Something is happening in our house, whether you like it or not. Claire. Claire, stop. You're overreacting. Don't tell me how to react. - Will you keep your voice down? - I will not! Maybe you're right. Maybe I am losing my mind. But what if I'm not? What if she died... ...some horrible death? Can we please not do this here? Oh, wow. You. You think you're smart, don't you? You think you got away with it. Well, I know you killed her, you murdering son of a bitch! Who? Don't give me that shit. Your wife. She's very upset. Forgive us, please. Honey. I didn't kill my wife. Are you all right? Come on, honey. Come on. Let's go. I'm sorry. You all right? Oh. Yeah. I'm fine. What happened? Just now? I just saw Norman's face. He was so frightened for me. How's your marriage? Good. Really good. We've had our moments, I guess... ...but he's a wonderful husband and father. I mean, sure, he can be obsessed with his work... ...and sometimes it's like... ...that he doesn't see me. Or, you know... ...like I'm.... That there's something wrong... ...with me. That can't feel good. No. Okay. I see where you're going with this... ...but my marriage is fine. No. I have had some kind of empty-nest episode... ...where I saw... ...some things that weren't there. Let's deal with that. I'm willing to deal with that. ""Thought you might need this. Love, Jody."" Uh-oh. Mrs. Spencer. I wanted to apologize for scaring you like I did. When I thought about how it must have seemed-- Please. Let's just.... Claire Spencer. Mary Feur. - Would you like a cup of coffee? - Very much. That day at the fence... ...you seemed terrified. I don't think I imagined that. No. What were you so afraid of? Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone... ...that you couldn't breathe? Thought that your time together was so... ...passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they'd leave? Um.... Sure. I couldn't catch my breath... ...and I panicked. I never dreamed anyone would hear me. I tried to leave him. I went to my mother's in Providence... ...but he brought my things up... ...in the middle of the night... ...during the rainstorm. He pleaded with me to come home. You must think I'm pathetic. No. I don't. I'll be quick. I've got to get Sidon to okay my budget before his trip. What's Templeton's wife's name again? Lois. Phil and Lois Templeton. Don't let her corner you, she'll chew your ear off. - Evening, Phil. - Here they are. How do you do? Hi. Hi. Nice to see you again, Lois. White wine, please. How are you holding up? Just fine. It's a lovely party. Norman was telling me the house is finished. - Almost. - Wonderful. It's good to see you doing so well. Thank you. Well, I was worried. I don't think I've seen you since Norman's reception here last year. You were worried? I swear, I've become that nosy old lady I used to run away from at Amherst. No, I'm just not sure what you mean. You got so upset. Oh, at the party. For the DuPont Chair. You remember? Well, I remember the party, but.... Oh, God! I had completely forgotten. I broke your crystal. Oh, my dear. A cheap wine glass from the caterers. But you went completely pale. You couldn't catch your breath. It was as if you had seen a ghost. ""Missing girl."" Madison Elizabeth. M-E. Frank. Madison Elizabeth... ...Frank. M-E-F. Claire? Hey, good morning. Up all night? Mm-hm. You okay? Do you remember this? It's the girl that disappeared last year. Did you know her? No. Claire, I'm afraid to ask. Where's all this going? It's her. The woman I saw in the bathtub. - The ghost? - Yes, the ghost. I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not. I'm positive this time. Claire, stop it! Stop it. I know you're going through something I don't understand. I have tried to be here for you, but this is enough, Claire. Enough. Do you want to go see somebody together? I'll call Dr. Drayton. Then what, Claire? What? Tell me what to do. It's her. So let me ask you this.... Mr. McCain? - McCann. - McCann. Nothing was ever found? No car, or...? Listen.... This girl's a real live wire. She drives around in a souped-up Mustang convertible. Most people think she's... ...off around Mexico or somewhere with her friends. The police downgraded it to a runaway. Her mother lives out here in Addison County. - Mrs. Frank? - Yeah? I'm Claire. I wanted to talk to you about Madison. Just plain coffee. - None of that mocha nonsense. - Fine. You look a little old for a student. I'm not a student. We met at a party. Well, that sounds about right. I never understood how a girl that wild got all A's. She liked to read a lot, though. Sometimes she'd lock herself up in her room for days, just reading. They wanted to put her in a school for the gifted when she was young. Maddie wouldn't hear about it. I don't know where she got it. She didn't get it from me. She probably got it from her father's side of the family. She never really mentioned her father. Yeah, well, she wouldn't. She was 12 when he left. Never spoke about him after that. You don't even need the sound. You can pretty much tell what's happening by the faces. I turn it up sometimes, though. Feels like there's someone here. Why are you here? I don't know. You want to see her room? Full scholarship. Princeton too. She wanted to stay on the East Coast. You must be so proud. These are the last pictures taken of her. The police used this one. Let me get that. Excuse me. Claire? Claire? - Hello, Dr. Spencer. - Mrs. Spencer. Forbidden fruit. You got a problem with that? Guess this means you're not mad at me anymore, huh? I wouldn't go that far. Ow. Take it easy, huh? What's got into you? - Ow! - What's the matter? It's too rough. Since when? This is a brand-new-- Shh. - Okay, Claire, that's-- - Why don't you shut up, professor? Why don't you just... ...shut up? I think she's starting to suspect something. Who? Your wife. Stop it! You know. What the hell are you doing? I know. I was there. Just before the accident. I remember now. What? I came to the door. There was whispering. I saw you in the mirror... ...lying there with her... ...in our house. Claire, listen to me. She was at the DuPont party... ...staring at me. It was her. That's why I couldn't breathe. That's why I dropped the glass. Honey, that was last year. We were having troubles. So you slept with a fucking student? - That's not what I'm saying. - Don't touch me. Get away from me. Get out! I said, get out! Fine. Claire, please, please. I gave up everything. Claire, please don't.... - My life, my music. - I never asked you to quit. There was never any other choice! You had to topple perfect daddy. That meant perfect wife. - Perfect family. - That's not fair. You were touring with a baby... ...and you were happy to give it up. When you did, you hated me for it, so you gave it all to her. - Who? - Caitlin! Leave her out of this. And then some bright young woman finds me attractive. - Stop it! - And I slipped! - God help me, I slipped! - I'm not gonna listen. - Claire, I tried to break it off. - You should've tried harder. I was in Adamant. In Adamant? You know, that artsy little hippie village a couple hours away down on 7. I stopped at this caf to get coffee, and I see Norman sitting in the back. But he wasn't alone. It was a young blond woman. I didn't see her face. I didn't think anything of it at first. And I was walking over to say hello. And they started arguing in such a way... ...that it stopped me. Then a few days later, you were in the accident. And I get a bizarre call from Stan working at the hospital... ...asking me, was I with you that day? If you were upset about anything. He made it sound like you had deliberately... ...driven your car into a tree. And I thought, ""Oh, my God. Claire's found out."" And when I went to the hospital, I see Norman. And he was so desperate at the thought... ...of losing you. I couldn't say anything. Please... ...don't hate me, Claire. I don't hate you. Hello, this is Miss Jody. Can't get to the phone. Leave your name and I'll call you back. Jody, it's Norman. I'm looking for Claire. Will you please... ...ask her to call home, please? I can't talk to him. Will you call and tell him I'll be home in the morning? I have to ask him something. Norman? Norman? Norman! Oh, God! Norman! - How's his blood pressure? - How about his rhythm? - Rhythm is normal. Normal sinus. - No sign of arrhythmia. - Good. Pulse/ox is normal. His pupils were equal. I'd still like to take you down. I'm fine, really. Dr. Powell, I'd recommend a cardiac workup. - I'll take care of that. - He needs to sign the release form. Thanks, guys. They can take you for a CAT scan tomorrow if you start feeling dizzy. I'm not going to the hospital... ...unless they have a miracle drug for clumsiness. Honey, I'm so sorry. Thank God you came home. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You know, if that breaker hadn't popped, he.... I know. Yeah, don't worry, Claire. You just keep him quiet tonight, okay? You might want to think twice about keeping anything electrical... - ...next to the tub. - Oh, thank you. Goodbye. Call me, okay? I called you last night. I left a message on Jody's machine. I want you to answer one question. Did you have anything to do with her disappearance? Yes. I had an affair with her. And when I tried to break it off... ...she became unstable. She came out here to the house. She threatened to kill herself... ...or you. I didn't think she'd go through with any of it. But then she.... She disappeared. It was her, Norman. She tried to kill you. - Claire. - You said it yourself. She wanted you dead. Are you saying I was attacked by a ghost? You had an affair with a girl... ...who threatened to kill herself, and now there's a presence in our house. A young, blond girl. Don't you get it? She did it, Norman. She's dead... ...and now she's trying to hurt you or both of us. - You don't know that she's dead. - Of course we do! It's the only thing that makes-- Oh, God. It's my fault. I.... I opened the door. - Madison. I stole her hair. - From where? - And it gave her power. - Claire. Nothing attacked me. There are no ghosts. It was an accident. I'm fine. It's not your fault. Are you listening to me? - Yes. - Claire, say it. Say it: ""It was an accident. It's not my fault."" Say it, Claire. I need to go lie down. I didn't sleep last night, and I need to lie down. I want to be alone for a while. Hey, Teddy, it's me. Right, yeah. What's the name of that friend of yours? That who-you-gonna-call guy? The guy that does the paranormal psych stuff? Holodnik. Could you contact him and ask him to give me a call here? I'd really like to talk to him today. Hello. Yes, this is he. Thanks for calling back. No, sir. That was my father. Yeah, he passed away a couple of years ago. Yes, he was. Thank you. Look, the reason I'm calling is.... I'm a little out of my depth here. Someone who is very close to me... ...believes herself to be or seems to be... ...in contact with some kind of... ...entity or spirit, and-- No, there's no... ...no history of delusional behavior. Well, I guess what I'm asking is, is it possible that she could be... ...causing these manifestations... ...through some kind of unconscious or telekinetic--? Uh-huh. Is there anything else that it could be? And this has been documented? Really? I'm sorry, but could I call you back... ...or have you call me back? Please, yes, that'll be great. Thank you, sir. Claire! Claire! Claire! You all right, Claire? The braid! Where's the braid? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? This? Is this what you're talking about? - Where'd you get this? - I took it from Madison's house. This is hers? This is Madison Frank's hair? What do you think? I really don't know. Norman. Yes... ...I believe you. You're playing. She's gone. How do you know? I can feel it. I picked up the book you ordered at the bookstore. Claire, I don't know how to apologize to you for what I've done. But if you give me another chance... ...I promise I'll spend the rest of my life making you glad that you did. Please. Last sail of the year. Beautiful, isn't it? We ought to take a drive before the leaves all disappear. - Stay at a little bed-and-breakfast. - Look for antiques. Yeah, we haven't done that for a while. Adamant. - Adamant? - An artsy little village down 7. Supposed to be charming. - Do you know it? - No. Maybe we'll stop there for lunch. What's that for? Nothing. God, oh, God.... You don't understand what that is. Don't I, Norman? That's Madison's necklace. You killed her, didn't you? I did not. I didn't kill anyone. Jesus, Claire. Listen to me. When I got here... ...she was already dead. She killed herself in our house to destroy me. Do you think I'm stupid? She left that for you in the garden, with a letter. I burned the letter and threw the box in the lake. A week before... ...she showed up at the DuPont party. I was terrified. She insisted, so I agreed to meet her here. When I got here... ...she had taken pills. I tried to revive her, but... ...she was gone. There was nothing I could do. So I put her in her car... ...and I drove to the boat ramp... ...and I rolled it out into the lake. I made a terrible mistake. I know that. But tell me, Claire. What should I have done? Should I sacrifice everything? Our marriage? My work, which I spent my whole life on? Tell me, Claire. Tell me, please. Because we can put this behind us. Our life can go on. It's not too late. What are you asking me to do? I'm asking you to forgive me. That girl must be brought up. Hello. This is Dr. Norman Spencer. I have some information... ...about a missing person. Madison Frank, yes. Could you send an officer out to the house, please? 15 Willoughby Lane. It's about a mile from the bridge. Okay. Thank you. I'm gonna go get dressed. Information. What city? Don't! Stop it! I begged you, Claire. I pleaded with you. But you wouldn't let it go. Oh, Claire. I never wanted any of this to happen. All I ever wanted... ...was for you to love me. Be proud of me. To be happy. She was going to go to the dean. She would have ruined us. Did she think I was just gonna sit there... ...and watch it happen? You have no idea what it was like. Hold her underwater... ...watch her life slip away. But she gave me no choice. And neither have you. I can't figure out how you put it all together. At first I thought you knew. Thought you created the whole ghost thing as an elaborate trap. Then I realized you believed it. It was a passive-aggressive masterpiece. The first time I met you... ...all I ever wanted was to spend the rest of my life with you. It's not gonna happen now. Too cold. I almost froze to death laying here... ...wet, naked, pretending to be electrocuted. Hey, Coop. How you doing? How you doing, boy? Let's go get your ball. Come on. Come on. Jody, it's Norman. If you're there, pick up, please. It's Norman. Listen, Claire and I... ...had a terrible blowout. Could you do me a favor? I'm sleeping at the lab. Could you check on her in the morning? I'm worried about her. Thanks. The halothane's starting to wear off. I'm sure in some... ...tragic way, your suicide is gonna... ...help bring Caitlin and I closer together. And every time I look at her... ...I'll see you. Oh, God. What's this? Oh, shit. I'm on the bridge! Somebody help me! I'm on the bridge! No! I beg you... ...think of Caitlin. Please, don't. Please., PETER: She looks at me every day. Mary Jane Watson. Oh, boy. If she only knew how I felt about her. But she can never know. I made a choice once to live a life of responsibility. A life she can never be a part of. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do. And I'm Peter Parker, and I, too, have a job. MAN: Parker. Parker! No, no, no, stop! Stop! Parker, you're late, man. Always late, huh? I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz. There was a disturbance. MR. AZIZ: Disturbance. Another disturbance. Always a disturbance with you. Come on, 21 minutes ago, in comes order. Harmattan, Burton & Smith. Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas. In eight minutes, I am defaulting on Joe's 29-minute guarantee. Then, not only am I receiving no money for these pizzas, but I will lose the customer forever to Pizza Yurt. Look, you are my only hope, all right? You have to make it in time. Peter, you're a nice guy. But you're just not dependable. This is your last chance. You have to go 42 blocks in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired. Go!   MAN: Hey, what, are you stupid? PETER: Woo-hoo! Whoo! Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas! CHILD: I'm gonna get it!   Hmm. Hey, you guys. No playing in the streets. Yes, Mr. Spider-Man. Yes, Mr. Spider-Man. See you. WOMAN: Way to go, Spidey!   Pizza time.  You're late. I'm not paying for those. Joe's 29-minute guarantee is a promise, man. I know to you, Parker, a promise means nothing. But to me, it's serious. It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz. You're fired. Go. Please, I need this job. You're fired. Look, give me another chance. JAMESON: You're fired. Parker, hello. You're fired. PETER: Why? Dogs catching Fflsbees? Pigeons in the park? A couple of geezers playing chess? Boss. Not now. I was thinking maybe the Bugle could show another side of New York for a change. We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah. We need page one. Parker, I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste. I pay you because-- Still not now! I pay you because, for some reason, that psycho Spider-Man will pose for you. Spider-Man won't let me take any more pictures. You've turned the whole city against him. A fact I'm very proud of. Now, get your pretty little portfolio off my desk before I go into a diabetic coma. Boss, your wife's on the line, she says she lost her checkbook. Thanks for the good news. Mr. Jameson, please, isn't there any of these shots you can use? I really need the money. AWWW. Miss Brant. Get me a violin. Yes? Five minutes to deadline, Jonah. All right, run a picture of a rancid chicken. Here's the headline: ""Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."" Some food got poisoned? I'm a little nauseous, yeah. All right, Mr. Jameson. It stinks. Robbie, there's your page one. ""Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."" I told you, he's not a menace. And I told you-- I'll take care of it. I'll give you 150. Three hundred. That's outrageous. Done. Give this to the girl. Thank you. Bye-bye. Hi. Hey, Pete. Oh. I don't think this covers the advance I gave you a couple weeks ago. Oh, right. BRANT: Sorry. Hey. Chin up, okay? BOY: Watch it, jerk! Oh, hey. Wow. Dr. Connors. Sorry. Where were you headed, Parker? To your class. CONNORS: My class is over. See me standing here? I'm sorry. I'm trying. I wanna be here. Then be here. Look at you, Peter. Your grades have been steadily declining. You're late for class. You always appear exhausted. Your paper on fusion is still overdue. I know. I'm planning to write it on Dr. Otto Octavius. Planning is not a major at this university. Octavius is a friend of mine. Better do your research, Parker. Get it done, or I'm failing you. ALL: Surprise! Well, say something. Uh, what's the occasion? Really, Peter. It's your birthday! ""What's the occasion""? Whether you want to remember it or not. He lives in another reality. Don't you, Pete? Hi. Hi, M.J. Hey. Hey, buddy. Long time, no see. So, uh, how's the play? I read a great review. It's going fine. It's going good. She's brilliant in it. Harry sent me roses. So where you been, pal? You don't return my calls. I've been busy. Taking pictures of Spider-Man? How's the bug these days? The less you see of that man, the better. Now, let's all go into the other room and have something to eat. MARY JANE: I'll get the hors d'oeuvres. PETER: So how are things going at Oscorp? Oh, they're great. I'm head of Special Projects. We're about to make a breakthrough on fusion. Oh, how lovely, Harry. Your father would be so proud, rest his soul. Thank you. We're actually funding one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius. I'm writing a paper on him. You want to meet him? You'd introduce me? You bet. Octavius is gonna put Oscorp on the map in a way my father never even dreamed of. M.J., could you give me a hand? She's waiting for you, pal. What do you mean? Oh, the way she looks at you or doesn't look at you. However you want to look at it. I don't have time for girls right now. Why, are you dead? I've been kind of busy. Taking pictures of your friend? Could we get off that subject? I want us to be friends, Harry. I want us to trust each other. HARRY: Then be honest with me. If you knew who he was, would you tell me?  May. Oh, what, Ben? Hmm? Wait. Oh-- Aunt May. Oh, my. Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there, I thought I was years ago. Everybody's gone, aren't they? Did they have a good time? I'm sure they did. You okay? Of course. But you go home. And be careful. I don't like that scooter thing you drive around. I'm worried about you. You're so alone. And I saw the letter from the bank. Oh, my. You did? Oh, well. So? I'm a little behind. Everybody is. Anyway, I don't want to talk about it anymore. I'm tired, and you better start back home. Here, kiddo. Happy birthday. You need it more than I do. No, I can't take that from you. Yes, you can! You can take this money from me. For God's sake, it's not much. Now, take it! And don't you dare leave it here. Oh, I'm sorry.  It's just that I miss your uncle Ben so much. Can you believe that it's two years next month since he was taken? I think to myself at times, were I to face the one responsible for what happened, I'd... Oh, I don't know what I'd do. Now, you better take the rest of your cake home.  MARY JANE: Hey. Hey. You're still here. I saw your billboard on Bleecker. Isn't it funny? I'm really kind of embarrassed. Don't be. It's nice. I get to see you every day now. I liked seeing you tonight, Peter. Oh, boy, yeah. ""Oh, boy, yeah"" what? Nothing. Do you want to say something? I... was... wondering if you're still in the Village. You're such a mystery.   Peter.  What?  Happy birthday. I'm seeing somebody now.  You mean, like a boyfriend? Well, like I like him. What?  Wow.  Nothing. That's good, you know? Companionship... May be more than that. More? I don't know. I'm gonna come see your play tomorrow night.  You're coming? I'll be there. Don't disappoint me. I won't.   MAN: Rent.  Hi. Hi. What's ""hi""? Uh... Can I spend it? I have a paycheck due this week and-- You're a month late again. Again. I promise as soon as I-- If promises were crackers, my daughter would be fat. I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. You know, all I got is this 20 for the rest of the week. DITKOVITCH: ""Sorry"" doesn't pay the rent. And don't try to sneak past me. I have ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent. Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch. Hi, Pete. OW! Oh!    Hello? Rent? RAYMOND: Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here. Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize. And we'll all be rich. It's not about the prizes, Harry. Ah, but you need money. You need Oscorp. Who do we have here? This is my good friend I called you about. The guy who got me through high school science. Peter Parker, sir. Parker. I'm writing a paper on you for-- Yes, yes. I know what you're doing here, but I really don't have time to talk to students right now.  But Oscorp pays the bills, so... That's right. That's why I have to take off. Board meeting. But my job is done here. Got you two geniuses together. Good luck tomorrow, Otto. Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden! Interesting fellow, your friend. Well, I won't take much of your time. Parker. Now I remember you. You're Connors' student. He tells me you're brilliant. He also tells me you're lazy. I'm trying to do better. Being brilliant's not enough, young man. You have to work hard. Intelligence is not a privilege, it's a gift. And you use it for the good of mankind. MAN: You want to try it back there? So is that it? Yes. My design to initiate and sustain fusion. PETER: I understand you use harmonics of atomic frequencies. OCTAVIUS: Sympathetic frequencies. Harmonic reinforcement? Go on. An exponential increase in energy output. A huge amount of energy. Like a perpetual sun providing renewable power for the whole world. Are you sure you could stabilize the fusion reaction?  Peter, what have we been talking about for the last hour and a half? This is my life's work. I certainly know the consequences of the slightest miscalculation. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to question you. Rosie, our new friend thinks I'm gonna blow up the city. You can sleep soundly tonight. Otto's done his homework. Come to the demonstration tomorrow, and you'll see for yourself. And you need to sleep soundly tonight, Otto. Did Edison sleep before he turned on the light? Did Marconi sleep before he turned on the radio? Did Beethoven sleep before he wrote the 5th? Did Bernoulli sleep before he found the curves of quickest descent? Ah, Rosie, I love this boy. Peter, tell us about yourself. Do you have a girlfriend? Uh, well... I don't really know. Well, shouldn't you know? I mean, who would know? Well, leave him alone. Maybe it's a secret love. Love should never be a secret. If you keep something as complicated as love stored up inside, gonna make you sick. I finally got lucky in love. We both did. But it's hardly perfect. You have to work at it. I met him on the college steps, and I knew it wasn't going to be easy. He was studying science, and I was studying English literature. That's right. I was trying to explain the theory of relativity. And Rosie was trying to explain T.S. Eliot. I still don't understand what he was talking about. ROSIE: Oh, come on. Yes, you do. I'm serious. T.S. Eliot is more complicated than advanced science. But if you want to get a woman to fall in love with you, feed her poetry. Poetry. OCTAVIUS: Never fails. PETER: A tall and slender maiden All alone upon a prairie Brightest green Were all her garments And her hair was like the sunshine Day by day he gazed upon her   DITKOVITCH: Rent! Where is my money?!  You seem jittery tonight. You never know who's coming. Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.  How'd you do that? Uh... Work out, plenty of rest. You know, eat your green vegetables. That's what my mom is always saying. I just never actually believed her. Come on. Go. Keep it steady.  It's a web. Go, Spidey, go! Whoo! We got trouble!   Get me down! I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said. His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity. Then you think we should forgive them? Yes. I mean, no.  Hey. Hey. Hey, chief. You park there, I'm towing it. Whatever. Shoelace.  You might want to...  Can I help you? Yeah, I, uh, come to see the show. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be seated after the doors are closed. It helps maintain the illusion. Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine. She asked me to come. But not to come late. I have to see this show. Just let me in, NI stand in the-- Shh. Hmm.  WOMAN : A Spider-Man A Spider-Man A-does whatever a spider can A-spins a web, any size Catches thieves a-just like flies Look out Here comes the Spider-Man Hey. You sure you don't wanna come tonight? Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah? Okay. Call me. I Will. You were great tonight. Thanks. MAN: May I have an autograph, please, miss? What are you doing here?  You hungry? Starved.  What was that? Okay.   Huh.   Cool Spidey outfit. Thanks. Where'd you get it? I made it. Hmm. Looks uncomfortable. Yeah, it gets kind of itchy. And it rides up in the crotch a little bit too.  MARY JANE : Hi. It's me. Sing your song at the beep.  Hi, M.J. This is Peter. I was on my way to your show and... Well, I was on my bike... Uh... Are you there? I really was planning on it all day. And... I know you predicted I'd disappoint you. Bingo. It's amazing, isn't it? How complicated a simple thing like being some place at 8:00 can become. Huh. Actually, there was this obnoxious usher. Somebody has to talk to that usher, M.J. FEMALE VOICE: Your time has expired. Please deposit 50 cents for the next five minutes.  I wanna tell you the truth. Here it is. I'm Spider-Man. Weird, huh? Now you know why I can't be with you. If my enemies found out about you, if you got hurt, I could never forgive myself. I wish I could tell you how I feel about you. OCTAVIUS: Ladies and gentlemen, my wife Rosie and I would like to welcome you this afternoon. But first, before we start, has anybody lost a large roll of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band? Because we found the rubber band.  It's a terrible joke. But thank you for coming. Today, you will witness the birth of a new fusion-based energy source. Safe, renewable energy and cheap electricity for everyone. And now let me introduce my assistants. These four actuators were developed and programmed for the sole purpose of creating successful fusion. They are impervious to heat and magnetism. These smart arms are controlled by my brain through a neural link. Nanowires feed directly into my cerebellum, allowing me to use these arms to control fusion reaction in an environment no human hand could enter. Doctor, if the artificial intelligence in the arms is as advanced as you suggest, uh, couldn't that make you vulnerable to them? How right you are. Which is why I developed this inhibitor chip to protect my higher brain function. It means I maintain control of these arms, instead of them controlling me. And now on to the main event. Give me the blue light, Rosie. Precious tritium is the fuel that makes this project go. There's only 25 pounds of it on the whole planet. I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and Oscorp Industries for providing it. Happy to pay the bills, Otto. Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seat belts. Doctor, we have a successful fusion reaction.  This is a breakthrough beyond your father's dreams. Thank you. RAYMOND: We're producing a thousand-megawatt surplus. OCTAVIUS: The power of the sun in the palm of my hand.   Keep calm! It's only a spike! It'll soon stabilize!  Pete... ROSIE: Ladies and gentlemen, please clear the room.  We have a containment breach! Otto, please get back! Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off! It will stabilize! It's under control! I'm in charge here! It's my money! I'm in con-- This doesn't change anything. What are you doing? Pulling the plug. No!   Rosie!    PARAMEDIC: Watch it. SCIENTIST: That was too close. If he had more than a drop of tritium, he could have destroyed the city. I'm ruined. I have nothing left, except Spider-Man. MAN: He saved your life, sir. He humiliated me by touching me. Mr. Osborn, the press will be here soon. I suggest we move on. HARRY: What was he doing here anyway? MAN: As you can see, molten metal penetrated the spinal cavity and fused the vertebrae at multiple points, including the lamina and the roof of the spinal column. We won't know the extent of the damage until we get in there. So I suggest we cutoff these mechanical arms, slice up the harness and, if need be, consider a Iaminectomy with posterior spinal fusion from C7-T1 to T12. WOMAN: We're ready, doctor. Anybody here take shop class?      Help me! Help me!  No!   It's all over town, Robbie. Gossip. Rumors. Panic in the streets, if we're lucky. Crazy scientist turns himself into some kind of a monster. Four mechanical arms welded right onto his body. Guy named Otto Octavius winds up with eight limbs. What are the odds? Hoffman! Yeah? What are we gonna call this guy? Uh-- Uh-- ""Dr. Octopus."" That's crap. ""Science Squid""? Crap! ""Dr. Strange."" That's pretty good. But it's taken. Wait, wait! I got it. ""Dr. Octopus."" Um, but- I like it. Of course you do. Dr. Octopus. New villain in town. ""Doc Ock."" Genius. What, are you looking for a raise? Get out. Chief, I found Parker. Where you been? Looking for you all morning. Why don't you pay your phone bill. Mad scientist goes berserk, and we don't have pictures! I heard Spider-Man was there. Where were you? Photographing squirrels? You're fired. Chief, the planetarium party. Oh, right. You're un-fired. I need you, come here. What do you know about high society? Oh. Uh, well, I-- Ah, don't answer that. My society photographer got hit in the head by a polo ball. You're all I got. Big party for an American hero. My son, the astronaut. Could you pay me in advance?  You serious? Pay you for what? Standing there? The planetarium, tomorrow night, 8:00. There's the door.  My Rosie's dead. My dream is dead. And these... monstrous things should be at the bottom of the river, along with me.  Something... in my head. Something talking. The inhibitor chip! Gone.  Rebuild. No. Peter was right. I miscalculated. I couldn't have miscalculated. It was working, wasn't it? Yes. We could rebuild. Enlarge the containment field. Make it bigger and stronger than ever. But we need money. Steal it? No, no, no, I'm not a criminal. That's right. The real crime would be not to finish what we started. We'll do it here. The power of the sun in the palm of my hand. Nothing will stand in our way. Nothing! AUNT MAY: That's the social security. Yes, I see. My uncle Ben's life insurance. Yes, but I'm afraid it's just not sufficient to refinance your home. Oh, but I'm giving piano lessons again. You are? Ow! Oh, ow!  We-- We appreciate that you've just opened up a new supersaver account with us today. But the fact is, you do not have the assets to justify this loan. I'm sorry. Well... At least we get the toaster. Actually, that's only with a deposit of, uh, 300 or more. Oh, yes, I see. Okay. Don't worry, we'll figure it out.  AUNT MAY: Peter? Don't leave me. Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero. MAN: Hold it! Put your arms up! All of them!  Here's your change!  Oh, no. Come on! Ha! Ow! You're getting on my nerves. I have a knack for that. Not anymore.  Freeze! Don't move! Freeze!  Hold your fire! Don't follow me. Wait a second.   Hand her over. Of course. Easy, now. Butterfingers.  Look out! Help me! AUNT MAY: Help me! I'm coming! Hang on!  Help!  Thank you.  Aunt May. You've stuck your webs in my business for the last time. Now you'll have this woman's death on your conscience. Come on. Shame on you.  PETER: Woo-hoo! There you go. Thank you. Oh, have I been wrong about you. We sure showed him. What do you mean, ""we""? Oh. Take me with you, Spider-Man. No, take me.   May I? Sure. Go ahead. MAN: Penny! Over here! HARRY: Leaveit  Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy. Why? It's a party. Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost a bundle on some crackpot who you thought was gonna take you with him to fame and fortune? Not to mention your friend the bug. Not tonight, Harry. Every night! Until I find him, it's 24-7. JAMESON: Parker:! Parker! Parker! What, are you deaf? I called you twice. Come on, what do you think, I'm paying you to sit around, sip champagne? Here, get a shot of my wife with the minister here. Beautiful tie. Ooh! No, get a shot of us with the DA. Beautiful dress. Ooh! Here, get a shot of the mayor and his girlfriend.  Wife.  WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. The committee for the Science Library of New York is pleased to present our guest of honor. He's the first man to play football on the moon.  The handsome, the heroic, the delicious Captain John Jameson.    Hi. Oh. You. Listen, I'm sorry. But there was a disturbance. I don't know you. And I can't keep thinking about you. It's too painful. I've been reading poetry lately. Whatever that means. Day by day he gazed upon her Day by day he sighed with passion Day by day-- Don't start. Can I get you a drink? I'm with John. He'll get me my drink. John. By the way, John has seen my show five times. Harry has seen it twice. Aunt May has seen it. My sick mother got out of bed to see it. Even my father. He came backstage to borrow cash. But my best friend, who cares so much about me, can't make an 8:00 curtain. After all these years, he's nothing to me but an empty seat.  You know, it pisses me off, your loyalty to Spider-Man and not to your best friend. I find him with my father's body, and you defend him because he's your bread and butter. Hey, take it easy. Hey, don't push me. Don't act like you're my friend. You side MA. from me. You stole my father's love. Then you let him die because you didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right? Huh? Isn't that right? Huh, brother?  JOHN: Ladies and gentlemen, I just want you all to know that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane Watson has just agreed to marry me.  MAN: What a surprise. Parker, wake up! Wake up! Shoot the picture!  Oh, no. No!  Why is this happening to me?  Aaaah. You seem very okay to me. My diagnosis? It's up here. You say you can't sleep. Heartbreak? Bad dreams? There is one dream where, in my dream, I'm Spider-Man. But I'm losing my powers. I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling. Oh. So you're Spider-Man. In my dream. Actually, it's not even my dream. It's a friend of mine's dream. Huh. Somebody else's dream. What about this friend? Why does he climb these walls? What does he think of himself? That's the problem. He doesn't know what to think. Gotta make you mad not to know who you are. Your soul disappears. Nothing as bad as uncertainty. Listen, maybe you're not supposed to be Spider-Man climbing those walls. That's why you keep falling. You always have a choice, Peter. I have a choice.   UNCLE BEN: All the things you've been thinking about, Peter, make me sad. Can't you understand? I'm in love with Mary Jane. Peter, all the times we've talked of honesty, fairness, justice... Out of those times, I counted on you to have the courage to take those dreams out into the world. I can't live your dreams anymore. I want a life of my own. You've been given a gift, Peter. With great power comes great responsibility. Take my hand, son. No, Uncle Ben. I'm just Peter Parker. I'm Spider-Man no more. No more. No more.    MAN: Hey! You punk! Sorry. Thanks. You're welcome.  OFFICER: Hurry up! And when the borderline is tau equals zero, the eigenvalues are...? Someone, please? .23 electron volts. Excellent work today, Parker. Keep it up. Why, I'm not really wicked at all, Cousin Cecily. You mustn't think that I'm wicked. If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very inexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would be hypocrisy. Oh. Of course, I have been rather reckless.   Hi. STAGE MANAGER : ""I am glad."" ""I am glad."" ""I am glad."" Are you glad to hear it? I am glad to hear it. In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own small way. Oh. You were so wonderful. That was such a great play. You could've told me you were coming. I was afraid you'd say, ""Don't come."" You look different. I shined my shoes, pressed my pants, did my homework. I do my homework now. You wanna get some chow mein? Peter, I'm getting married. I always imagined you getting married on a hilltop. And who's the groom? You hadn't decided yet. You think just because you saw my play, you can talk me out of getting married? You once told me you loved me. I let things get in the way before. There was something I thought I had to do. I don't have to. You're too late. Will you think about it? Think about what? Picking up where we left off. Where was that? We never got on. You can't get off if you don't get on, Peter. I don't think it's that simple. Of course you don't, because you complicate things. You don't understand. I'm not an empty seat anymore. I'm different. Punch me, I bleed. I have to go. I'm getting married in a church. You are different. JAMESON: Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding, not go into bankruptcy. Caviar? What, are we inviting the tsar? Get some cheese and crackers, some of those little cocktail weenies. Boss, I got a garbage man here says he's got something you might want to see. Don't tell me you have the head of an extraterrestrial in there, because if you do, you're the third guy this week. Where the hell did you get that? In the garbage. In the garbage? He must've given up. Thrown in the towel. Abandoned his sad little masquerade. I finally got to him. The power of the press triumphs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, uh, I think I deserve a little something for this. Give you 50 bucks. I could get more than that on eBay. All right, 100. Miss Brant, give this man his money and throw in a bar of soap. Your wife is still on that line. Flowers? How much? You spend any more on this thing, you can pick the daisies off my grave. Get plastic. Gotta go, big story.    Spider-Man Spider-Man Where have you gone to Spider-Man? Where have you gone to Spider-Man?    MAN 1: Come on, man. Get the money. Come on, come on. MAN 2: Help! MAN 1: Come on! AUNT MAY: It wasn't fair to have gone like that. He was a peaceful man. And it was all my doing. Aunt May. You don't have to punish yourself. Oh, I know I shouldn't. It's just that you wanted to take the subway, and he wanted to drive you. If only I had stopped him. We'd all three of us be having tea together. I'm responsible. For what? For what happened to Uncle Ben. But you were at the library. You were doing your homework. He drove me to the library, but I never went in. What do you mean? I went some place else. Some place where I thought I could win some money to buy a car, because I wanted to impress Mary Jane. It happened so fast. I won the money, and the guy wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed. The thief was running towards me. I could've stopped him, but I wanted revenge. I let him go. I let him get away. He wanted a car. He tried to take Uncle Ben's. Uncle Ben said no, and then he shot him. Uncle Ben was killed that night for being the only one who did the right thing. And I, uh... I held his hand when he died. I've tried to tell you so many times.  Just one more little chore.  Where are you? I'm leaving for the night, sir. Fine. Your father only obsessed over his work. Good night, Bernard.  Hello, Harry. Otto. What do you want? That precious tritium. But I need more of it this time. More tritium, are you crazy? You'll destroy the city! You're a hack! Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! All right! All right, all right, all right, all right. Put me down. We'll make a deal. Kill Spider-Man, I'll give you all the tritium you need. On second thought, bring him to me alive. How do I find him? Peter Parker. Parker? He takes pictures of Spider-Man for the Bugle. Make him tell you where he is. Have it ready. Don't hurt Peter!  WOMAN: Somebody, help! Fire! MAN: Alisa. Alisa, the Chens can't find their daughter. Have you seen her? Somebody call the fire department! Help! Help! Is anybody in that building? We think there's a kid stuck on the second floor. Hey, Where you going?!    I'm coming!  Aah! Oh! It's okay. It's okay. Come here. I'm gonna get you out of here. Come on. Come on.    Mama.   You got some guts, kid. Some poor soul got trapped on the fourth floor. Never made it out. Oh, man. All right, Billy, let's knock it down and roll them up. Get on out of here. FIREMAN: Let's pick it up! Let's get all this equipment, let's go! Let's move it! Am I not supposed to have what I want? What I need? What am I supposed to do? Oh, uh... I shouldn't have without knocking.  Come in. Hi. Um... Would you like a piece of chocolate cake? Okay. And a glass of milk? That would be nice. Okay.  Thank you. Mm-hmm. Oh, um... You got a message. It's your aunt. Thanks. Mm-hmm. What's going on? Oh, they gave me another few weeks, but I decided the hell with it. I'm moving on. I found a small apartment. Why didn't you tell me? I'm quite able to take care of things myself. And Henry Jackson across the street is giving me a hand, and I'm giving him $5. That's Henry Jackson? Yes. Yes. It's funny what happens in two years. Nine years old, has great ambitions. Um... Listen, about my last visit... Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it. It's water over the dam or under the bridge or wherever you like it. But you made a brave move in telling me the truth. And I'm proud of you. And I thank you, and I... I love you, Peter. So very, very much. Hey. Where are all my comic books? Oh, those dreadful things? I gave those away. HENRY: I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker. Thank you, Henry. Hi, Peter. Hey, Henry. You're getting tall. Henry, why don't you put those cookbooks in with the mixer. Okay. You take Spider-Man's pictures, right? PETER: I used to. HENRY: Where is he? Henry and I agree. We don't see his picture in the paper anymore. He, uh... Why? quit. Wanted to try other things. He'll be back, right? I don't know. You'll never guess who he wants to be. Spider-Man. Why? Well, he knows a hero when he sees one. Too few characters out there, flying around like that, saving old girls like me. And Lord knows, kids like Henry need a hero. Courageous, self-sacrificing people setting examples for all of us. Everybody loves a hero. People line up for them. Cheer them. Scream their names. And years later, they'll tell how they stood in the rain for hours just to get a glimpse of the one who taught them to hold on a second longer. I believe there's a hero in all of us that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble and finally allows us to die with pride. Even though sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams. Spider-Man did that for Henry, and he wonders where he's gone. He needs him. Do you think you could lift that desk and put it into the garage for me? But don't strain yourself. Okay. Strong focus on what I want.  Woo-hoo! I'm back! I'm back!   My back. My back.  Honey, you sure you don't want to invite your friend, the photographer? Peter Parker? Oh. Positive. Thought he was your pal. Peter Parker? Yeah. Uh, he's just a great big jerk. The world's full of great big jerks. You're adorable. It's just the uniform. Lean your head back for me. Put my head back? Yeah, just do it. Just put my head back? Mm-hmm. Okay. Wow. I'm back on the moon. You up there with me? Hiya. Surprised? Very. Thanks for coming. Everything okay? Uh, you might say so. This is funny. I'm not sure how to begin. You know how our minds play tricks on us. Tell me about it. Well, mine did a real number on me. Some part of me heard what you had to say after the show that night, that you were different. But I didn't want to listen. I was afraid to trust you. But I've been thinking about it-- Listen, there's more for me to say. I maybe rushed into things. I thought-- Wait a minute. What are you saying? I'm saying... I... I thought I could be there for you, Mary Jane, but I can't. My mind was playing tricks too. Do you love me, or not? I... don't. You don't. Kiss me. Kiss you? I need to know something. Just one kiss.     What's happening? Peter Parker, and the girlfriend. What do you want? I want you to find your friend Spider-Man. Tell him to meet me at the Westside Tower at 3:00. Well, I don't know where he is. Find him. Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones. If you lay one finger on her... You'll do what?   Still no word on the whereabouts of your son's fiance. Sorry, Jonah. It's all my fault. I drove Spider-Man away. He was the only one who could've stopped Octavius. Yes. Spider-Man was a hero. I just couldn't see it.  He was a-- A thief! A criminal! He stole my suit! He's a menace to the entire city! I want that wall-crawling arachnid prosecuted! I want him strung up by his web! I want Spider-Man! Where is she? Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.   What the hell? Aah!     You have a train to catch. CONDUCTOR: Help! Help! Help! I can't stop it! The brakes are gone!  It's Spider-Man. Oh, my God, this is it! Tell everyone to hang on! CONDUCTOR: Brace yourselves!  Any more bright ideas? I got a few, yeah!  Whoa, watch out!  We're slowing down.  MAN: Nice and easy, we'll go down. Slower. Gently. Is he alive? He's just a kid. No older than my son. It's all right. We found something. We won't tell nobody. It's good to have you back, Spider-Man.  He's mine! You want to get to him, you got to go through me. And me. Me too. Very well.  Where do you want him? And the tritium? Yes. If only I could cause you the pain that you've caused me. First we'll see Who's behind the mask. I can look into your eyes as you die. Pete. No. It can't be. Harry. Where is she? Where is he keeping her? He's got M.J. No. All he wanted was the tritium. Tritium? He's making the machine again. When that happens, she'll die, along with half of New York. Now, where is he? Peter, you killed my father. There are bigger things happening here than me and you. Harry, please, I've got to stop him.  MARY JANE: Hey! Hey!  I'm talking to you! You got what you needed for your little science project, now let me go. I can't let you go, you'd bring the police. Not that anybody could stop me now that Spider-Man's dead. He's not dead. I don't believe you. Believe it. Surprise. As soon as you get free-- I should have known Osborn wouldn't have the spine to finish you! Shut it down, Ock. You're going to hurt a lot more people this time. Well, that's a risk we're willing to take. Well, I'm not.   Hang on, Mary Jane! Run! Let's see you scurry out of this.  Now what?    Dr. Octavius. We have to shut it down. Please tell me how. Peter Parker? ""Brilliant but lazy."" Look at what's happening. We must destroy it. I can't destroy it.  I won't.  You once spoke to me about intelligence. That it was a gift to be used for the good of mankind. A privilege. These things have turned you into something you're not. Don't listen to them.  It was my dream. Sometimes, to do what's right, we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams. You're right. He's right.  Listen. Listen to me now. Listen to me now. Now, tell me how to stop it. It can't be stopped. It's self-sustaining now. Think! Unless...  The river. Drown it. I'll do it.    No!  Hi. Hi. This is really heavy.   M.J. In case we die... You do love me. I do. Even though you said you didn't. I will not die a monster.    I think I always knew, all this time, who you really were. Then you know why we can't be together. Spider-Man will always have enemies. I can't let you take that risk. IWill... always be Spider-Man. You and I can never be.  JOHN: Mary Jane!  Hello?    Who's that? OSBORN: Son. I'm here. Dad? I thought you were-- I'm alive in you, Harry. Now it's your turn. You swore to make Spider-Man pay. Now make him pay. But Pete's my best friend. And I'm your father. You're weak. You were always weak. You'll always be weak until you take control. Now you know the truth about Peter. Be strong, Harry. Avenge me. Avenge me! No!     Call Deborah.  The--? The caterer? Tell her not to open the caviar.  Had to do what I had to do. Mary Jane. Peter. I can't survive without you. You shouldn't be here. I know you think we can't be together. But can't you respect me enough to let me make my own decision? I know there'll be risks. But I want to face them with you. It's wrong that we should only be half-alive, half of ourselves. I love you. So here I am, standing in your doorway. I've always been standing in your doorway. Isn't it about time somebody saved your life? Well, say something. Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.  Go get them, tiger. Whoo! Woo-hoo!   , Inside a snowflake, like the one on your sleeve... there happened a story you must see to believe. Way up in the mountains, in the high range of Pontoos... lay the small town of Whoville: The home of the Whos. Ask any Who, and they'll have this to say: ""There is no place like Whoville around Christmas Day."" Every window was flocked, every lamppost was dressed... and the Whoville band marched in their Christmas-y best. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Arbor Day was fine, and Easter was pleasant... and every Saint Fizzin's day, they ate a Fizz pheasant. But every Who knew, from their twelve toes to their snout... they loved Christmas the most, without a single Who doubt. - Farfingle's welcomes you! - Thank you. Merry Christmas! Thank you for shopping Farfingle's! We got a snoozlephone for your brother Drew... and a snoozlephone for your brother Stu, a muncle for your uncle... a fant for your aunt and a fandpa for your cousin Leon. So, we just need... Cindy? Sale on Aisle 3! - Cindy Lou! - Merry Christmas. Hello, Myrna. Merry Christmas, Fred. Excuse me. Cindy Lou? Honey? - Dad? - Yeah? Doesn't this seem like a bit much? This is what Christmas is all about! Can't you feel it? Merry Christmas! Thank you for shopping Farfingle's. Wait a second! Your change! Another minute closer to Christmas! And, for the next five minutes only, 99 percent off! Yes, every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot... but the Grinch, who lived just north of Whoville... did not. Get on it, girls. All the good mistletoe's at the top. - Hey, Drew, I'll race you! - Not if I race you first. Last one to the top is a stinky old Grinch! You guys, where are we? I think we should go back. What? You're scared of the Grinch! No! They say he lives up here in a big cave. And only comes down when he's hungry for the taste of... - Who flesh! - Drew! You're scared of the Grinch! You're scared of the Grinch! - Are too! - Am not! Wait for me! Go on, touch it. Touch the door. Do it for me, Stu. Well done, Max! Serves them right, those Yuletide-loving... sickly-sweet, nog-sucking cheer mongers! I really don't like them. No, I don't. Max! Get my cloak! I've been much too tolerant of these Whovenile delinquents... and their innocent, victimless pranks. So, they want to get to know me, do they? They want to spend a little quality time with the Grinch. I guess I could use a little... social interaction. Merry Christmas! Yeah, you bet. Ho, ho, ho, and stuff. Oh, my. Someone has vandalized that vehicle. You see, Max? The city is a dangerous place. The Grinch hated Christmas. The whole Christmas season. Top of the day. Flatfoot. Now, please, don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason. Here's a present for you. Be sure to run real fast with it. Come on. Double time. Move. It could be that his head wasn't screwed on just right. Or it could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. But I think that the most likely reason of all... may have been that his heart was two sizes too small. Stranger, won't let you go till you buy a chapeau! Boy, nothing beats Christmas, right? I guess. You guess? It's just, I look around at you and Mom and everyone getting all kerbobbled. Doesn't this seem superfluous? Dad! Dad! - What happened to you? - It was the Grinch! - Grinch? - What do you want? I mean... ""Grinch? Oh, no!"" Did someone just say, ""Grinch""? Hello, Mayor May-Who, sir. Lou. I don't need to remind you that this Christmas... marks the one thousandth Whobilation. Whoville's most important celebration! And The Book of Who says, very clearly: ""Every size of Who we can measure... ""knows that Whobilation is a time we must treasure."" Now, Lou, please tell me that your boys... were not up on Mount Crumpit... provoking the one creature within a billion bilometers of here... who hates Christmas! But it was the Grinch! No, sir, the boys didn't see any Grinch. It was, and he came after... I think they were up on the mountain... playing with matches, or defacing public property, or... That's a relief. All right, you heard the man: There is no Grinch problem here. - I need it there by tomorrow. - Heck of a rush. Merry Christmas, Mo. Heck of a rush. But, Dad... I just don't understand something. Why won't anyone talk about the Grinch? You kids and the Grinch! You see, Cindy, the Grinch is a Who, who always... Actually, not a Who. He's more of a... - A what? - Exactly, honey. And he's a What who doesn't like Christmas. Take a look at his mailbox, sweetie. Not a single Christmas card, in or out. Ever! But why? Lou, where's my mail? Lou! Got the wrong mail here. Lou! I got the wrong mail! - I'll be right there. - Lou, we got a problem! All right, we'll straighten this out. It'll take them years to sort this out. This is his and now it's yours, and this hers and now it's his! And for the rest of you: Jury duty! Jury duty! Jury duty! Blackmail. Pink slip. Chain letter. Eviction notice. Jury duty! Would you mind helping me take this to the back room, honey? - Be careful of the sorting machine, right? - Yeah. Gesundheit. You're the... The... The Grinch! That worked out nicely. Help! Help me! Somebody! Max, let's go. Our work here is finished. Help me! Please help! That is not a chew toy! Stop it, Max! Get that out of your mouth! You have no idea where it's been! Help! Bleeding hearts of the world, unite! There! Give me that! Don't you know you shouldn't take things that don't belong to you? What's your problem? Are you a wild animal? Let's go. Thanks for saving me. Saving you? Is that what you think I was doing? Wrong-o. I merely noticed that you were improperly packaged, my dear. Hold still! Max, pick out a bow. Can I use your finger for a second? Hello! Hello! - Cindy? - Dad! Daddy! Daddy! What the hey...? Honey. Cindy? Dad! It was amazing! You've been practicing your Christmas wrapping! I am so proud of you. Now, that's holiday. Sweet little Cindy didn't know what to do. In her head, bum-tumbled a conflict or two. ""If the Grinch was so bad, then why did he save me? ""Maybe he wasn't so bad."" Maybe. Just maybe. No lights on in the house. Your mom must be shopping. Good, I'm so glad you're home. I can feel it, Lou. This is the year. When everybody asks who has the most spectacular lights in greater Whoville... they're gonna cry out, ""Mrs. Betty Lou Who!"" Isn't this the chandelier from the dining room? It's all for the cause, dear. And Cindy? Could you be Mommy's little helper... and unscrew the bulb there from the refrigerator? - 'Cause somehow I missed that one. - Go on! Every year Martha May Whovier has the best lights. Not this year. This year... I'm gonna beat that prim, perfect little prissy... Betty! - Hi! - Martha! My, I've never seen so many beautiful Christmas lights, Betty Lou! I'd blow every fuse if I tried to keep up with you, Martha May! Isn't this antique darling? It's handcrafted and almost 100 years old. Jeez. I'm really impressed! This, however, is new. Betty! Sweetie! Good night, Betty. - I got it! - Honey, I've got it. Hello? Is my sub-zero chillibrator running? - I suppose. - You better go catch it! That's a good one! That is rich. Let's go home. Fleas before beauty. Thank you. Come on, hurry up, Slowpoke. There's got to be a better way! A car would have paid for itself by now! Goody. Another load coming down. What's that stench? It's fantastic! Max! Grab a bag. We'll come back for the rest. Of course, when I say ""we,"" I mean ""you."" It's amazing what these Whos just throw away. Oh, well. One man's toxic sludge is another man's potpourri. I don't know. It's some kind of soap. ""Where are you, Christmas? ""Why can't I find you? ""Why have you gone away? ""My world is changing ""I'm rearranging ""Does that mean Christmas ""changes too? ""Where are you, Christmas? ""Do you remember ""The girl you used to know? ""You and I were so carefree ""Now nothing's easy ""Did Christmas change ""Or just ""me?"" Sweet! ""Be it ever so ""Heinous ""There's no place like home"" First floor, factory rejects. Those Whos are hard to frazzle, Max! But we did our worst. And that's all that matters. At least I scared the bejeebles out of that little girl at the post office. She'll be scarred for life, if we're lucky. Funny she didn't rat on us, though. Must be afraid of reprisals. Yes! Down a size and a half! And this time, I'll keep it off. Get the stick, Max. Get the stick! There's no stick! I'm smarter. Any calls? You have no messages. Odd. Better check the outgoing. If you utter so much as one syllable... I'll hunt you down and gut you like a fish! If you'd like to fax me, press the star key. Oh, well. That's more like it. Excellent year. I'll tell you, Max... I don't know why I ever leave this place. I've got all the company I need right here. Hello! Hello! How are you? How are you? I asked you first. I asked you first. That's really mature, saying exactly what I say! Mature... exactly... what I say... I'm an idiot! You're an idiot! All right, fine. I'm not talking to you anymore. In fact, I'm going to whisper. So that by the time my voice reverberates off the walls and gets back to me... I won't be able to hear it! You're an idiot! Am I just eating because I'm bored? Who could that be? Hello, little girl. Are you here to read to us? No. I hear you know some things about the Grinch. Cindy Lou had some questions in her curious heart. Why did the Grinch hate Christmas? Where did it all start? With her dad's blabbacorder she wouldn't give an inch. In your own words, please tell me everything you know about the Grinch. Where did he come from? He came the way all Who babies come. On calm nights... baby Who girls and tiny Who fellas... drift from the sky in their own pumbersellas. Hey, honey, our baby is here! He looks just like your boss. So that's how it works. It was Christmas Eve, and a strange wind blew that night. We were having our annual holiday get-together. It was morning before anybody realized that he was out there! The poor dear! But, you know what? We knew right away that he was special. Do you want a Christmas cookie? Yes, which Christmas cookie would you like? Santa. His first words! Yes, that is a Santa plate. Do you want to hold this Santa plate? Santa, bye-bye! He was a wonderful... whatever he was. And we raised him like any other Who child: With a deep love of Christmas. Don't forget, tomorrow is our big Christmas gift exchange. Everyone bring a special gift for a special someone. The... Grinch... He had no sense of color coordination. Although I hardly remember him. I didn't have time to socialize. I was far too busy with my... studies. Now, class, is everyone almost finished? And if the truth be told, he... He liked Martha. Martha was my girlfriend. I don't like discussing this Grinch so very close to Christmas, but... maybe if you hear the truth, you'll understand why... Put your back into it! I tried to take him under my wing. You don't have a chance with her. You're 8 years old and you have a beard! He had hair. Not pleasant. He shed. Not right. You know, Christmas is my favorite time of year. I just love the colors. The red... and the green. Did I have a crush on the Grinch? Of course not. I didn't ask you that. Right. For some reason, when he came home that day... he really got into the Christmas spirit for the first time. Perfect! Whoopsie! What a lovely family heirloom! The fires of love! This will be perfect on the top of her tree. Oh, Martha! Oh, Christmas! I want you all to look your best tomorrow. You don't have a chance with her. You're 8 years old and you have a beard! Has everyone given their gifts? - I haven't. - What? Merry Christmas, Martha May. Why do you have a bag on your head? Probably because he's embarrassed by that hideodorous gift. Mr. Grinch... please take the bag off. Yes, you. Take it off. Put the book down. And your foot. Look at that hack job! Stupid present! Stupid tree! I hate Christmas! - The anger. - The fury! The muscles! It was a horrible day when they were so cruel to him. And... I could hardly bear it. I hate Christmas! I hate it! And that was the last time we ever saw him. The very last time. So, whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes... he stood outside his cave... hating the Whos. Alphabetically. Aardvarkian Abakenezer Who... I... hate you! Aaron B. Benson Who, I hate you. Hate, hate, hate. Hate, hate, hate. Double hate. Loathe entirely! Nutcrackers? It's their Whobilation. He snarled with a sneer. Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here. Max! Fetch me my sedative. Now to take care of those pesky memories. ""Whobilation, plentiful with candy canes and pies ""I can't wait to get there to eat some google fries ""Whobilation, Whobilation"" - Dad? - Yeah. I've been thinking about the Whobilation and I may do something drastic. That's fine, dear. Ask your mother. - Where did she go? - Honey! Honey! Hi! Look, I just found the cutest light for my Christmas display. Hurry up, we're gonna be late. Come on. And now, the nominations... for that Who among us who best typifies... the qualities of Whodom and Whodery... the Whoville holiday cheermeister! Do I hear a nomination? I nominate the Grinch! - The Grinch? - The Grinch? My, my, my. What an altruistic daughter you have there, Lou! Thank you. Cindy? Let me quote a verse... from The Book of Who. Thank you. ""The term 'Grinchy' shall apply when Christmas spirit is in short supply."" Now, I ask you: Does that sound like our holiday cheermeister? True, Mr. May-Who. But The Book of Who says this too: ""No matter how different a Who may appear... ""he will always be welcomed with holiday cheer."" Yes, the book also says, the... ""The award... ""cannot go to the Grinch, because... ""sometimes things get the lead-pipe cinch."" You made that up! It doesn't say that. No, it does. What page? Lost my place, but it's... It's in here! But the book does say: ""The cheermeister is the one who deserves a back slap or a toast. ""And it goes to the soul at Christmas who needs it most."" And I believe that soul is the Grinch. And if you're the Whos I hope you are, you will too. She's right! Fine. You people want to waste a perfectly good nomination... why, it's up to you. But I am telling you... the Grinch will never come down. And when he doesn't, the Mayor will wear the crown. Well, more or less. ""Deck your heart with jollity ""Style your smile all Christmas-y ""Flick some flocking on the tree ""Let there be Whobilation ""Bake the fruitcake, egg the nog ""Feed the flaming Who-ltide log ""Baste the beast and gulp the grog ""Let there be Whobilation ""Tick, tock, tick, tock ""Counting down the Christmas clock ""Old, young, big, small"" Blast this Christmas music. It's joyful and triumphant. Must drown them out! Not working! The whipperwinds whipped high above the Who town. A trip or a slip you'd slide all the way down. But this girl had a mission. She knew what to do. She'd invite the Grinch herself, that brave Cindy Lou. Play, monkey! Play! Howdy? Mr. Grinch? Mr. Grinch! Hello? Excuse me. Hello... little girl. How dare you enter... the Grinch's lair? The impudence! The audacity! The unmitigated gall! You called down the thunder... now, get ready for the boom! Gaze into the face of fear! Mr. Grinch... my name is Cindy Lou Who. You see? Even now the terror is welling up inside you. I'm not scared. Denial is to be expected in the face of pure evil. I don't think so. Doubt? Another unmistakable sign of the heebie-jeebies! Now you're doomed! Run for your life... before I kill again! I'm a psycho! Danger! Danger! Maybe you need a time-out. Kids today. So desensitized by movies and television. What do you want? Mr. Grinch, I came to invite you... to be holiday cheermeister. - ""Holiday Whobie-what-y""? - Cheermeister. ""Cheermeister. Celebrate with friends."" That's a good one. I know you hate Christmas, but what if it's all just a misunderstanding? - Don't care. - I myself am having some Yuletide doubts. But maybe if you reunite with the Whos and be a part of Christmas... ""Maybe if you reunite with the Whos and be a part of Christmas."" Grow up! Then maybe it'll be all right for me, too! I'm sorry, your session is over. Please make another appointment with the receptionist on the way out. Please, please. You have to accept the award. Award? You never mentioned an award! Yeah, with a trophy and everything. - And I won? - You won! - That means there were losers. - I guess. - So, if you come... - A town full of losers! I like it. Was anyone emotionally shattered? Come on, a minute ago I couldn't shut you up! Details, details! The Mayor wasn't happy. Oh, no. Martha May will be there. She will? And she'll see me. A winner. She'll be on me like fleegle flies on a flat-faced floogle horse. I'm sorry to disappoint you, Martha, baby, but the G train has left the station. So, will you come? All right. I don't know if it's that adorable twinkle in your eye... or that nonconformist streak... that reminds me of a younger, less hairy me. But you've convinced me. Who knows? This Whobilation could change my entire outlook on life! - Really? - No. There you are, honey. You can make snow angels later. We can't be late for the Whobilation! The nerve of those Whos. Inviting me down there on such short notice. Even if I wanted to go, my schedule wouldn't allow it. ""4:00, wallow in self-pity. ""4:30, stare into the abyss. ""5:00, solve world hunger... ""tell no one. ""5:30, jazzercise. ""6:30, dinner with me."" I can't cancel that again. ""7:00, wrestle with my self-loathing."" I'm booked. If I bumped the loathing to 9:00, I'd have time to lay in bed... stare at the ceiling and slip slowly into madness. But what would I wear? It's not a dress, it's a kilt! Sicko! Stupid. Ugly. Out of date. This is ridiculous. If I can't find something nice to wear, I'm not going! That's it, I'm not going. It's time for our Holiday Cheermeister of the Year Award! Congratulations, Mr. Grinch! He isn't here. What? He didn't show? Who could have predicted this? All right. I'll swing by for a minute, allow them to envy me... grab a handful of popcorn shrimp, and blow out of there. But what if it's a cruel prank? What if it's a cash bar? How dare they? All right, I'll go. But I'll be fashionably late. No. Yes. No. Yes. No! Yes! Definitely not! All right. I've made my decision! I'm going, and that's that. Had my fingers crossed. Maybe I should flip a coin! I guess the award goes to... the runner-up. That's right. A man for whom Christmas comes not once a year... but every minute of every day. A handsome, noble man. A man who has had his tonsils removed twice! That's an interesting story. You see, what happened was... Hello, Martha. He made it! - Cindy. - Honey! Look... Hot crowd. Hot crowd. I believe I'm here to... accept an award of some kind. And the child mentioned a check. - No, I didn't. - All right, then, give me the award. Come on, while I'm young! Don't you worry, Mr. Holiday Cheermeister, you'll get your award. But first, a little family reunion. They nursed you. They clothed you. Here they are... your old biddies! Are you two still living? We missed you! Rose. The sweater. The sweater, Rose. Sweater? What are you talkin' about? No, I can't! I can't do that! Don't touch me there! Put him in the Chair of Cheer! Chair of Cheer? What's the Chair of Cheer? You didn't tell me about the Chair of Cheer. Please, Mr. Grinch. No. I can't do it, honestly. I'm not ready. It's too much, too soon! It's that time of year. The Cheermeister's ride in the Chair of Cheer! Put me down! I mean it! I've got a lawyer. There'll be hell to pay! First, you'll put your taste buds to the test... as you judge the Who pudding cook-off! - Mine first. - I really don't know... No, mine's the best! You'll enjoy this! This is not pudding. What is it? This is mine. Yummy, yummy, yummy. Christmas conga! Look at the time. I really should be getting back. All right! Fruitcake, tra-la-la! No. Fudge Judge. Made it myself. Yeah? Mine are homemade too. Okay. Put it in. Bring it on! Is that all you got? Is that all you got? Come on. Out of the way, slow-mo! Excuse me. He's number one in the sack race run! Number one! I'm number one! I'm number one! No child can beat the Grinch! I beat you. He won! And now it's time for the moment we've all been waiting for. Yes! My award. - Write the check. - There's no check. Are you sure? Because I thought I heard someone mention a check. I said, there's no check. And now it's time... for Present Pass-it-on! As always, we start with our Cheermeister. The gift of a Christmas shave. Look at that hack job! Yes, yes, yes. Good times! Good times. And now, I have a little something for the love of my life. Martha May... please become Mrs. Augustus May-Who. Augustus... If you agree to be my wife... along with a lifetime supply of happiness, you'll also receive this: It's a new car! Generously provided by the taxpayers of Whoville! What do you say, Martha? You got 20 seconds on the clock. I... These gifts are quite dazzling. Of course they are. That's what it's all about, isn't it? That's what it's always been about! Gifts! Gifts. Gifts, gifts, gifts. You want to know what happens to your gifts? They all come to me. In your garbage. You see what I'm saying? In your garbage! I could hang myself with all the bad Christmas neckties I found at the dump! And the avarice. The avarice never ends! ""I want golf clubs."" ""I want diamonds."" ""I want a pony, so I can ride it twice, get bored, and sell it to make glue."" Look, I don't want to make waves, but this whole Christmas season is... stupid, stupid, stupid! There is, however... one teeny-tiny... Christmas tradition... I find... quite meaningful. Mistletoe. Now, pucker up and kiss it, Whoville! Somebody's fabulous! All right, your turn! Go on! - Let's go! - No! Excuse me, old-timer. Mind if I wet my whistle? That's my good stuff! Burn, baby! Burn! The Whomanity! - Let's go! Come on! - No, wait! - Do something. - Right! Calling all units. Calling all units. Taxi! It's because I'm green, isn't it? Halt! Evening, folks. Mind if I ride along? You might want to scooch over. You did the right thing. Out of the way! That's gonna hurt in the morning. It's gonna blow! You fellas all right? How about a nice hat? Lou? I'm hurt, Lou. I'm hurt, and I don't hurt easily. But you and your family... I'm so... disappointed. Can we just get back to Christmas... the way it should be? Grinch-less? Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! I just wanted everybody to be together for Christmas. I quite enjoyed that. I hope I get another invite soon. Come on, come on! Good thing we have a spare. Suffering snorkelblatz! They're relentless! Only four hours till Christmas! Yes, the Grinch knew tomorrow all the Who girls and boys... would wake bright and early and rush for their toys. And then, the noise! The noise, noise, noise! They'll bang on tong-tinglers. They'll blow their floo-flounders. They'll crash on jang-jinglers and bounce on boing-bounders! Then Whos young and old would sit down to a feast. And they'll feast and they'll feast. And they'll feast, feast, feast, feast! They'll eat their Who pudding. And rare Who roast beast! But there's something I just cannot stand in the least. Oh, no. I'm speaking in rhyme! Blast you Whos! And the more the Grinch thought of what Christmas would bring... the more the Grinch thought: I must stop this whole thing. Why, for year after year I've put up with it now! I must stop this Christmas from coming! But how? I mean, in what way? ""Christmas is goin' to the dogs ""We're scoffing down the turkey and the grog ""Things are looking very good, it's true"" Are you having a holly, jolly... Christmas? Wrong-o! If you're not going to help me... then you might as well... Then he got an idea. An awful idea. The Grinch got a wonderful... awful idea. I know just what to do. The Grinch laughed in his throat. And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat. And he chuckled and clucked... at this great Grinchy trick. With this coat and this hat, I'll look just like Saint Nick. ""You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch ""You really are a heel ""You're as cuddly as a cactus and as charming as an eel ""Mr. Grinch ""You're a bad banana ""With a greasy black peel ""Just face the music, you're a monster ""Mr. Grinch, yes, you are ""Your heart's an empty hole ""Your brain is full of spiders You got garlic in your soul ""Mr. Grinch ""I wouldn't touch you with a ""thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole"" I asked for three-quarters, not five-eighths. Stay focused! ""You know, if you asked the who's who of Whoville ""No one would deny it"" Air bag is a little slow. But that's what these tests are for! ""You're a vile one ""Mr. Grinch ""You have termites in your smile ""You have all the tender sweetness Of a seasick crocodile ""Mr. Grinch ""Given the choice between you ""I'd take the seasick crocodile"" Fat boy should be finishing up anytime now. Talk about a recluse. He only comes out once a year, and he never catches any flak for it! Probably lives up there to avoid the taxes. Merry Christmas! Oopsie. Forgot about the reindeer. Did that stop the old Grinch? No. The Grinch simply said: If I can't find a reindeer... I'll make one instead. Oh, Max! So he called his dog Max... and he took some red thread... and tied a big horn on top of his head. All right. You're a reindeer. Here's your motivation. You're Rudolph, a freak with a red nose, nobody likes you. Then one day, Santa picks you and you save Christmas. No, forget that part. We'll improvise. Just keep it kind of loosey-goosey. You hate Christmas! You're gonna steal it! Saving Christmas was a lousy ending. Way too commercial. Action! Brilliant! You reject your own nose... because it represents the glitter of commercialism! Why didn't I think of that? Cut, print, check the gate. Moving on. That... feels... good. Here goes nothin', hot dog! Wow! This is nuts! On, Crasher! On, Thrasher! On, Vomit and Blitzkrieg! We're gonna die! We're gonna die! I'm going to throw up, and then I'm gonna die! Mommy, tell it to stop! Almost lost my cool there. All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air. All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care... when he came to the first little house on the square. Welcome to Whoville, Max. Betty? - Betty? - What? Did you hear something? It's Santa! Go right back to sleep. Come on, Max. It's our first stop. The old Grinchy Claus hissed. And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist. He'd slide down the chimney. A rather tight pinch. But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch. He's planning a double-twisting interrupted forward-flying 2-and-a-half... with a combo tuck and pike. High degree of difficulty. He got stuck only once, for a moment or two. Blasted water weight! Goes right to my hips. Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue. A little more stealth, please. Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row. These stockings... he grinned... are the first thing to go. Okay, fellas. Show time. Then he slunk to the icebox. Slunk? He eyed the Whos' feast. He took the Who pudding. He took the roast beast. Hike! He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash. Why, that Grinch, he even took their last can of Who hash. Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee. And now... grinned the Grinch... I'll stuff up the tree. And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove... when he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove. Excuse me. The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter... who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water. Santa Claus? What are you doing with our tree? But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick... he thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick. Why... my sweet little tot. The fake Santa Claus lied. There's a light on this tree... that won't... light on one side. So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear. I'll fix it up there... and I'll bring it back here. Santa, what's Christmas really about? Vengeance! I mean... presents... I suppose. I was afraid of that. And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head, and he got her a drink... and he sent her to bed. Santa? - What? - Don't forget the Grinch. I know he's mean and hairy and smelly. His hands might be cold and clammy. But I think he's actually kind of sweet. Sweet? You think he's sweet? Merry Christmas, Santa. And when Cindy Lou went up with her cup... Nice kid. Bad judge of character. ...he went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up. And the last thing he took was the log for their fire. On their walls he left nothing but some hooks and some wire. And the one speck of food that he'd left in the house... was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse. Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant... around each Who home, and he took every present. Clearance sale. Everything must go. What now? Martha... have you ever kissed a man who lost his tonsils twice? No, silly! But it's an experience that I've always longed for. Kiss me, you fool! What are you laughing at... Rudolph? It's all you, Maxie! 3,000 feet up, up the side of Mount Crumpit... he rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it. We did it! We did it! We did it! That wasn't so bad, was it, Max? They'll be waking up now. And I know just what they'll do. All those Whos... down in Whoville... will all cry. What an embarrassment! I've been robbed! Mayor May-Who? Oh, dear. I wonder who could have done this. Tell you people one thing: Invite the Grinch... destroy Christmas. Invite the Grinch... destroy Christmas! But did anyone listen to me? - I did. - No. You choose to listen... to a little not-to-be-taken seriously girl... who hasn't even grown into her nose yet. Cindy, I hope you're very proud... of what you've done. If she isn't, I am. I'm glad he took our presents. - What? - I... - I'm glad. - He's glad. You're glad. You're glad everything is gone. You're glad that the Grinch virtually wrecked... No, not wrecked, pulverized Christmas. Is that what I'm hearing? You can't hurt Christmas, Mr. Mayor... because it isn't about the gifts or the contests or the fancy lights. That's what Cindy's been trying to tell everyone. And me. She's been trying to tell me. What is wrong with you? This is a child. She's my child. And she happens to be right, by the way. I don't need anything more for Christmas than this right here, my family. - Merry Christmas, everybody! - Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, you hunk of burnin' Who! Give me a break. Merry Christmas! Mr. Grinch? Mr. Grinch? Now for the final note in my symphony... of downright nasty not-niceness! The crescendo of my odious opus! The wailing and the gnashing of teeth. The bellowing of the bitterly bummed out! It'll be like music to my ears! Then the Grinch heard a sound rising over the snow. It started in low. Then it started to grow. But the sound wasn't sad. Why, this sounded merry. But it was merry. Very. Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small... were singing without any presents at all. He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming. It came. Somehow or other, it came just the same! Mr. Grinch? And the Grinch, with his Grinch feet ice-cold in the snow... stood puzzling and puzzling. How could it be so? It came without ribbons! It came without tags! It came without packages, boxes or bags! And he puzzled and puzzled... till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something... he hadn't before. Maybe... Christmas... he thought... doesn't come from a store. Maybe Christmas... perhaps... means a little bit more. Help me! I'm... feeling! And what happened then... well, in Whoville they say... that the Grinch's small heart... grew three sizes that day. What's happening to me? I'm all... toasty inside. And I'm leaking. Oh, Max. I love you! All right, that's enough. Knock it off. Beat it! Get out of here! One step at a time. No. The sleigh. The presents. They'll be destroyed! And I care! What is the deal? Wait! This can't happen! It shouldn't! It couldn't! It mustn't! It wouldn't! Not now, not then, not ever again! No! Oh, well. It's just toys, right? Hi, Mr. Grinch! Cindy Lou! What are you doing up there? I came to see you. No one should be alone on Christmas. No! I got you, Cindy Lou! You did it! Spread eagle! Nailed it! Are you all right? Are you kiddin'? The sun is bright and the powder's bitchin'! Now scoot over! It's my turn to drive! I'd better slow this buggy down! - We're gonna crash! - Now you listen to me, young lady! Even if we're horribly mangled... there'll be no sad faces on Christmas. What is it? Help! - Cindy! - Grinch? My baby! Grab an end. By the way, these lights match your outfit perfectly. This could be more difficult to negotiate. Heads up, Whoville! Hurry! Here he comes! Out of the way! I have no insurance! Yeah! Run for your lives! Watch out, I can't stop! - Daddy, move! - Dad, move it! Thanks for the help. - Hi, Daddy! - Hi, Cindy, honey! Merry Christmas... one and all! Cindy! Mommy! All right. What do we have here? You got me, Officer! I did it! I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas. And I'm... sorry. Aren't you gonna cuff me? Put me in a choke hold? Blind me with pepper spray? You heard him, Officer. He admitted it. - I'd go with the pepper spray. - Yes, I heard him, all right. He said he was sorry. Besides, it looks like everything is all here and accounted for. Help me out here, people. Martha? Merry Christmas, August May-Who! I'm afraid I do have something for you! Your ring back. Sorry... but my heart belongs to... someone else. No hard feelings? Cheer up, dude. It's Christmas. Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch. Your cheek is so... I know. Hairy? - No. - Greasy? Stinky? Do I have a zit? No. Warm. Fah who foraze, dah who doraze Welcome, Christmas, come this way Fah who foraze, dah who doraze Welcome, Christmas, Christmas Day Welcome, welcome, fah who Ramus Welcome, welcome, dah who Damus Christmas Day is in our grasp So long as we have hands to clasp Fah who ray-moo ya-who hee haw Welcome, Christmas, bring your cheer Fah who foraze Dah who doraze, welcome all Whos Far And Near So he brought back the toys and the food for the feast. And he, he himself, the Grinch... carved the roast beast. Yeah! There's nothin' like the holidays. - Who wants the gizzard? - I do! Too late! That'll be mine. Where are you, Christmas? I think I've found you This time I'll make you stay All will be singing Bells will be ringing Now and forever Christmas Day Where are you, Christmas Why can't I find you Why have you gone away Where is the laughter You used to bring me Why can't I hear music play My world is changing I'm rearranging Does that mean Christmas Changes too Where are you, Christmas Do you remember The one you used to know I'm not the same one See what the time's done Is that why you have Let me go Christmas is here Everywhere Christmas is here If you care If there is love In your heart and your mind You will feel like Christmas all the time I feel you, Christmas I know I've found you You never fade away The joy of Christmas Stays here in silence Fills each and every heart With love They're makin' noise Noise, noise, noise How I hate their happy noise There's only one thing I hate more Come to think of it And that's the people who keep Makin' it Feast, feast, feast, feast They'll have more than anyone could ever eat Me, I'm stuck here with my Cream of wheat There's no one here to feast with me On this lonely Christmas Eve Don't they know I'm up here all alone In my cave up in the hills How I wish that this would go away This dreadful holiday That they call Christmas Day It's a lonely Christmas Eve The streets are filled with Christmas cheer At least it's only once a year Perfect parcels tied with perfect bows And carols ringing in my ear Bundled up against the cold Lines wherever gifts are sold Each shop window displays a Christmas scene For everybody young and old Icicles on eaves troughs and tinsel on the tree But it's a green Christmas for me Couples skating on the pond Makin' angels on the lawn Five red mittens drying on the rack And needle-shedding Tannenbaum Red bows on the railings and snowflakes on the ground But it's a green Christmas in this town Green 'Cause of everything I miss All this mistletoe, no kiss And with every Christmas wish There would be no greater gift Than to have this envy lift Carolers are at my door Don't wanna hear them anymore Stockings on the mantel The snow's here every day But it's a green Christmas anyway Red nose on the reindeer Tinsel on the tree But it's a green Christmas for me, I don't know about you, it's just too hot today, isn't it? And it's going to get even worse. Temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius... ...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100. So, please, remember to cover up and stay cool... ...with the hottest hits on your FM dial. Come on, guys, time to go home. Come on, love, off you get. - Do we have to? - Yes, we do. I'll make you your favorite dinner to compensate. He squealed like a pig, didn't he? Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D. Did you see his face? Hey, Big D. Beat up another 10-year-old? - This one deserved it. - Yeah. - Five against one, very brave. - Well, you're one to talk. Moaning in your sleep every night? At least I'm not afraid of my pillow. ""Don't kill Cedric."" Who's Cedric, your boyfriend? - Shut up. - ""He's going to kill me, Mum."" Where is your mum? Where is your mum, Potter? She dead? Is she dead? Is she a dead Pott...? - Dudley. - Dudley, let's go. - What's going on? - What are you doing? - I'm not doing anything. - We're getting out of here, Dudley. Come on, Dudley, hurry up. Dudley, run. Expecto Patronum. Mrs. Figg. Don't put away your wand, Harry. They might come back. Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next? - Whole world's gone topsy-turvy. - I don't understand. How do you know...? Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you. Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore? After You-Know-Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year... ...did you expect him to let you go wandering on your own? Good Lord, boy. They told me you were intelligent. Now, get inside and stay there. Expect someone will be in touch soon. Whatever happens, don't leave the house. It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere. There's sweat. There's stifling. Diddykins? Is that you? Duddy. Vernon, come quick. We're going to have to take him to a hospital. Who did this to you, boy? Happy, are we, now? You've finally done it. You've finally driven him loopy. Vernon, don't say that. Well, just look at him, Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy. I've reached my limit, do you hear? This is the last I'm gonna take of you and your nonsense. - Dear Mr. Potter. - What? The Ministry has received intelligence that at 6:23 this evening... ...you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle. As a clear violation... ...of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery... ...you are hereby expelled... ...from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk. Justice. He's not very well. Sorry, Hedwig. Very clean, these Muggles. - Tonks, for God's sake. - Unnatural. Professor Moody. - What are you doing here? - Rescuing you, of course. But where are we going? The letter said I've been expelled. You haven't been. Not yet. Kingsley, you take point. But the letter said... Dumbledore persuaded the minister to suspend your expulsion... ...pending a formal hearing. - A hearing? Don't worry. We'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters. Not here, Nymphadora. Don't call me Nymphadora. Stay in formation, everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed. Come on, you, around the corner. Come on. In you go, son. There've been no sightings. No deaths. No proof. He almost killed Harry. If that isn't proof enough... Yes, but guarding you-know-what is the most important... We must trust Dumbledore on this. Was he able to protect Harry last year? Tonight I say it's time to take action. Cornelius Fudge is a politician first and a wizard second. - His instinct would be to ignore it... - Keep your voices down. He's getting stronger and stronger by the minute. We have to act now. - Harry. - Mrs. Weasley. Heavens, you're all right. Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait until after the meeting's finished. Nope. No time to explain. Straight upstairs, first door on the left. Yeah. Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves. If my poor mistress knew the scum they let into her house... ...what would she say to old Kreacher? Oh, the shame. - Freaks. - There, there, mistress. Scum of the earth. Not like it was in the days of my fathers. Kreacher is here. Oh, Harry. Are you all right? We overheard them talking about the Dementor attack. - You must tell us everything. - Let the man breathe, Hermione. And this hearing at the Ministry. It's just outrageous. I've looked it up. They simply can't expel you. - It's completely unfair. - Yeah. There's a lot of that going round at the moment. So, what is this place? - It's headquarters. - Of the Order of the Phoenix. It's a secret society. Dumbledore formed it back when they fought You-Know-Who. Couldn't have put any of this in a letter, I suppose? I've gone all summer without a scrap of news. We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did. - Only... - Only what? Only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything. Dumbledore said that? But why would he keep me in the dark? Maybe I could help. I'm the one who saw Voldemort return... ...the one who fought him, who saw Cedric Diggory get killed. - Harry. - Thought we heard your dulcet tones. - Don't bottle it up, though. Let it out. - If you're all done shouting... Do you wanna hear something a little more interesting? If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for Harry... ...we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back. He's not a child, Molly. But he's not an adult either. - He's not James, Sirius. - Well, he's not your son. He's as good as. - Who else has he got? - Hey, Ginny. - He's got me. - How touchingly paternal, Black. Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather. Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus. - Snape's part of the Order? - Git. - About your supposed reformation. - I know better. - So why don't you tell him? - Get off it. - Quick. - Get it up. - Crookshanks. - Stop it. - Get off, you bloody cat. - Crookshanks. Leave it alone. - Get it up. - Hermione, I hate your cat. - Bad Crookshanks. Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen. Just because you're allowed to use magic now... ...does not mean you have to whip your wands out for everything. Hi, Mum. You hungry, Harry? You sure you're all right, Harry? Gave us quite a turn. Harry Potter. Sirius. This is very, very peculiar. It seems your hearing in the Ministry is to be before the entire Wizengamot. I don't understand. What has the Ministry of Magic got against me? Show him. He'll find out soon enough. He's been attacking Dumbledore as well. Fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet... ...to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned. Why? He thinks Dumbledore's after his job. No one in their right mind could believe that... Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind. It's been twisted and warped by fear. Now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry. The last time Voldemort gained power... ...he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear. Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the minister will do almost anything... ...to avoid facing that terrifying truth. We think Voldemort wants to build up his army again. Fourteen years ago, he had huge numbers at his command. And not just witches and wizards, but all manner of dark creatures. He's been recruiting heavily, and we've been attempting to do the same. But gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in. We believe... ...Voldemort may be after something. Sirius. Something he didn't have last time. You mean like a weapon? No. That's enough. He's just a boy. You say more and you might as well induct him into the Order. Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight. Harry. You are hereby expelled. Before the entire Wizengamot. Trains. Underground. Ingenious, these Muggles. Here we are. I've never used the visitors' entrance before. Should be fun. Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money. Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons trading on the potions market. Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet? Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous? - Morning, Arthur. - Morning, Bob. Interdepartmental memos. We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable. Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley. They've changed the time of your hearing. When is it? In five minutes. Department of Mysteries. And I'm confident, minister, that you will do the right thing. Yes, but we must be... Remember, during the hearing, speak only when you're spoken to. Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong. As the Muggles say, truth will out. Yes? I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid. Good luck, Harry. Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August... ...into offenses committed by Harry James Potter... ...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag... Witness for the defense. Albus Percival Wulfric... ...Brian Dumbledore. You got our message that the time and place of the hearing... ...had been changed, did you? - I must have missed it. But by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. The charges? The charges against the accused are as follows: ""That he did knowingly... ...and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions... ...produce a Patronus Charm... ...in the presence of a Muggle."" - Do you deny producing said Patronus? - No, but... And you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school... ...while under the age of 17? - Yes, I was, but... Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot... I was only doing it because of the Dementors. Dementors? In Little Whinging? That's quite clever. Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy? - Highly convenient. - I'm not lying. - There were two of them, if I hadn't... - Enough. I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would be a very well-rehearsed story... ...but since you can produce no witnesses of the event... Pardon me, minister, but as it happens, we can. Please describe the attack. What did they look like? Well, one of them was very large and the other rather skinny. Not the boys. The Dementors. Oh, right, right. Well, big. Cloaked. Then everything went cold... ...as though all the happiness had gone from the world. Now, look here. Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb... ...and happen across a wizard. The odds are astronomical. I don't think anyone would believe... ...the Dementors were there by coincidence, minister. I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, professor. Dementors are, after all, under the control of the Ministry of Magic. And it's so silly of me, but it sounded for a moment as though... ...you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy. That would be disturbing indeed, Madam Undersecretary... ...which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry... ...into why the two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban... ...and why they mounted an attack without authorization. Of course, there is someone... ...who might be behind the attack. Cornelius, I implore you to see reason. The evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontrovertible. He is not back. In the matter of Harry Potter... ...the law clearly states... ...that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations. Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore. Clearly. Has it become practice to hold a full criminal trial... ...to deal with a simple matter of underage magic? Those in favor of conviction? Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges? Cleared of all charges. Professor. Padfoot. Are you barking mad? You'll blow the entire operation. Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you... I had to see you off, didn't I? What's life without a little risk? I don't wanna see you get chucked back in Azkaban. Don't worry about me. Anyway, I wanted you to have this. Original Order of the Phoenix. Marlene McKinnon. She was killed two weeks after this was taken. Voldemort wiped out her entire family. Frank and Alice Longbottom. Neville's parents. They suffered a fate worse than death, you ask me. It's been 14 years. And still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad. Do you really think there's going to be a war, Sirius? It feels like it did before. You keep it. Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now. I'll see you at the train. Bye-bye, darling. I love you. Hold my hand, lovey. There they are. They're in the far carriage. Bye. I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free. Better enjoy it while you can. I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it. - What'd I tell you? Complete nutter. - Just stay away from me! It's only Malfoy. What'd you expect? Hi, guys. - Hey, Neville. - Hey there, Neville. What is it? - What's what? - That. Pulling the carriage. Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry. It's pulling itself, like always. You're not going mad. I can see them too. You're just as sane as I am. Everyone, this is Loony Love... Luna Lovegood. What an interesting necklace. It's a charm, actually. Keeps away the Nargles. Hungry. I hope there's pudding. - What's a Nargle? - No idea. Good evening, children. Now, we have two changes in staffing this year. We're pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank... ...who'll be taking Care of Magical Creatures... ...while Professor Hagrid is on temporary leave. We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... ...Professor Dolores Umbridge. And I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing the professor good luck. Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you... She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge. Thank you, headmaster, for those kind words of welcome. And how lovely to see all your bright... ...happy faces smiling up at me. I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends. - That's likely. - That's likely. The Ministry of Magic has always considered... ...the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. Although each headmaster... ...has brought something new to this historic school... ...progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged. Let us preserve what must be preserved... ...perfect what can be perfected... ...and prune practices that ought to be prohibited. Thank you, Professor Umbridge. That really was most illuminating. - Illuminating? What a load of waffle. - What's it mean? Magic is forbidden in the corridors... It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts. Dean, Seamus. - Good holiday? - All right. Better than Seamus', anyway. Me mum didn't want me to come back this year. - Why not? - Let me see. Because of you. The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot of things about you and Dumbledore. What, your mum believes them? Nobody was there the night Cedric died. I guess you should read the Prophet, then, like your stupid mother. - Don't talk about my mother. - I'll have a go at anyone calling me a liar. - What's going on? - He's mad, is what's going on. Do you believe the rubbish he's come out with about You-Know-Who? Yeah. I do. Has anyone else got a problem with Harry? - You all right? - Fine. Seamus was bang out of order, mate. - But he'll come through, you'll see. - I said, I'm fine, Ron. Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then. Harry. Bring it over here. Over here. Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it. Good morning, children. Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations. O-W-Ls. More commonly known as OWLs. Study hard and you will be rewarded. Fail to do so, and the consequences may be severe. Your previous instruction in this subject has been disturbingly uneven. But you'll be pleased to know, from now on... ...you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved... ...course of defensive magic. Yes? There's nothing in here about using defensive spells? Using spells? Well, I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom. We're not gonna use magic? You'll be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way. What use is that? If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free. Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class. It is the view of the Ministry... ...that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient... ...to get you through your examinations... ...which, after all, is what school is all about. And how's theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there? There is nothing out there, dear. Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourself? Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort. Now, let me make this quite plain. You have been told... ...that a certain dark wizard is at large once again. - This is a lie. - It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him. Detention, Mr. Potter. Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord? Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident. It was murder. Voldemort killed him. Enough! Enough. See me later, Mr. Potter. My office. Come in. Good evening, Mr. Potter. Sit. You're going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. Potter. No, not with your quill. Going to be using a rather special one of mine. Now... ...I want you to write, ""I must not tell lies."" How many times? Well, let's say for as long as it takes for the message to sink in. You haven't given me any ink. Oh, you won't need any ink. Yes? - Nothing. - That's right. Because you know, deep down... ...you deserve to be punished. Don't you, Mr. Potter? Go on. - Skiving Snackboxes. - Sweets that make you ill. Get out of class whenever you like. Obtain hours of pleasure from unprofitable boredom. Care for another? - I'm not asking you to write all of it. - Please. I've been busy studying for these stupid OWL exams. I'll do the introduction. That's all. Hermione, you're honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met. - And if I'm ever rude to you again... - I'll know you've gone back to normal. What's wrong with your hand? Nothing. The other hand. - You've got to tell Dumbledore. - No. Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now. I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction. Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you. - If the parents knew about this... - I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron? Harry, you've got to report this. - It's perfectly simple. You're being... - No, it's not. Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple. You don't understand. Then help us to. Dear Padfoot... ...I hope you're all right. It's starting to get colder here. Winter is definitely on the way. In spite of being back at Hogwarts, I feel more alone than ever. I know you, of all people, will understand. Hello, Harry Potter. - Your feet. Aren't they cold? - Bit. Unfortunately, all my shoes have mysteriously disappeared. I suspect Nargles are behind it. - What are they? - They're called Thestrals. They're quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they're a bit... Different. But why can't the others see them? They can only be seen by people who've seen death. So you've known someone who's died, then? My mum. She was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment... ...and one day, one of her spells went badly wrong. - I was 9. - I'm sorry. Yes, it was rather horrible. I do feel very sad about it sometimes, but I've got Dad. We both believe you, by the way. That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and you fought him... ...and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you. Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do. I don't think that's true. But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel. What do you mean? Well, if I were You-Know-Who... ...I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else... ...because if it's just you alone... ...you're not as much of a threat. - Do you ever stop eating? - What? I'm hungry. Harry. Can I join you? Pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating? I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students... ...you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices. So silly of me, but it sounds... ...as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom... ...Minerva. Not at all, Dolores, merely your medieval methods. I am sorry, dear. But to question my practices is to question the Ministry... ...and by extension, the minister himself. I am a tolerant woman... ...but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty. Disloyalty. Things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared. Cornelius will want to take immediate action. What's happened to Dumbledore? Having already revolutionized... ...the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts... ...Dolores Umbridge will, as high inquisitor, have powers... ...to address the seriously falling standards at Hogwarts School. Just one question, dear. You've been in this post how long, exactly? You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct? Yes. But you were unsuccessful? Obviously. Could you please predict something for me? I'm sorry? Move those mouths. One teensy little prophecy? Pity. No, wait. Wait, no. I think I do see something. Yes, I do. Something dark. You are in grave danger. Lovely. Cho. What's going on? It's Professor Trelawney. Sixteen years I've lived and taught here. Hogwarts is my home. You can't do this. Actually, I can. Something you'd like to say? Oh, there are several things I would like to say. There... Professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside? Sybil, dear. This way. Thank you. Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms... ...of Educational Decree Number 23, as enacted by the minister... You have the right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds. That power remains with the headmaster. For now. Don't you all have studying to do? Professor. Professor? Professor Dumbledore. Professor! Professor Dumbledore. That foul, evil, old gargoyle. We're not learning how to defend ourselves. We're not learning how to pass our OWLs. She's taking over the entire school. Security has been and will remain the Ministry's top priority. Furthermore, we have convincing evidence... ...that these disappearances are the work... ...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black. Harry. Sirius. - What are you doing here? - Answering your letter. You said you were worried about Umbridge. What's she doing? Training you to kill half-breeds? - She's not letting us use magic at all. - Well, I'm not surprised. The latest intelligence is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat. Combat? What does he think, we're forming some sort of wizard army? That's exactly what he thinks. That Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry. He's becoming more paranoid by the minute. The others wouldn't want me telling you this, Harry... ...but things aren't going at all well with the Order. Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn... ...and these disappearances are just how it started before. Voldemort is on the move. Well, what can we do? Someone's coming. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. But for now, at least, it looks like you're on your own. He really is out there, isn't he? We've got to be able to defend ourselves. And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how, we need someone who will. Harry. This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me? I'm a nutter, remember? Look on the bright side: You can't be any worse than old toad face. - Thanks, Ron. - I'm here for you, mate. Who's supposed to be meeting us, then? Just a couple of people. Lovely spot. Thought it would be safer off the beaten track. Matey, come back here. Hi. So you all know why we're here. We need a teacher. A proper teacher. One who's had experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts. - Why? - Why? Because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot. - So he says. - So Dumbledore says. So Dumbledore says because he says. The point is, where's the proof? If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed... I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here, clear out now. Come on, Hermione. They're here because they think I'm some freak. Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm? Yes. I've seen it. Blimey, Harry. I didn't know you could do that. And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office. It's true. Third year, he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once. Last year, he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh. Wait. Look, it all sounds great when you say it like that... ...but the truth is, most of that was just luck. I didn't know what I was doing half the time. I nearly always had help. - He's just being modest. - No, Hermione, I'm not. Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow. But out there... ...when you're a second away from being murdered... ...or watching a friend die right before your eyes... You don't know what that's like. You're right, Harry, we don't. That's why we need your help. Because if we're going to have any chance at beating... ...Voldemort... He's really back. Right. First we need to find a place to practice... ...where Umbridge won't find out. - The Shrieking Shack. - It's too small. - Forbidden Forest? - Not bloody likely. Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out? Who cares? I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules? Who are you and what have you done with Hermione? Anyway, at least we know one positive thing that came from today. What's that? Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she? Right. Over the next few days, we should each come up... ...with a couple of possibilities of places we can practice. We've got to make sure, wherever it is, there's no chance she can find us. Will do, Harry. All student organizations are henceforth disbanded. Any student in noncompliance will be expelled. Watch where you're going, Longbottom. You've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement. The what? It's also known as the Come and Go Room. The Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it. And it's always equipped for the seeker's needs. So say you really needed the toilet... Charming, Ronald. But, yes, that is the general idea. It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back. Expelliarmus. I'm hopeless. You're just flourishing your wand too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus. You will please copy the approved text four times... ...to ensure maximum retention. - There will be no need to talk. - No need to think's more like it. - Expelliarmus. - Wands away. Stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal. It's a wizard's bread and butter, really. So come on, then, Nigel. Give it your best shot. Stupefy! Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done. Don't worry. I'll go easy on you. Thanks, Ronald. - Come on, Ron. - Come on, Ron. - You can do it. - Come on, Ron. - One Sickle. - You're on. Stupefy. - Thank you. - Shut up. I let her do that. It's good manners, isn't it? It was completely intentional. Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea? Now, focus on a fixed point and try again. Expelliarmus. Very good. Keep your concentration. Great. A little higher. I'm okay. I'm okay. - Stupefy. - Stupefy. Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit... ...may sign up in the high inquisitor's office. Diminuendo. Working hard is important, but there's something that matters even more: Believing in yourself. - Expelliarmus. - Levicorpus. Got it. Think of it this way. Every great wizard in history has started out... ...as nothing more than what we are now: Students. If they can do it, why not us? - Stupefy. - Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Reducto. - Expelliarmus. - Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man. So that's it for this lesson. Now, we're not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays. So just keep practicing on your own as best you can. And well done, everyone. Great, great work. Well done, mate. Thanks. See you after Christmas. See you in the Common Room, Harry. - Thanks a lot, Harry. - No worries. - Thank you so much. - Not at all. Merry Christmas. - Thank you, Harry. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Have a good Christmas. - Have a great Christmas, Luna. - We've been thinking. We could always slip Umbridge some Puking Pastilles. Or Fever Fudge. They give you massive, pus-filled boils... Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me? Are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day. Yeah. I'm okay. Anyway, it's worth it. It's just, learning all this... ...makes me wonder whether, if he'd known it... Cedric did know this stuff. He was really good. It's just, Voldemort was better. You're a really good teacher, Harry. I've never been able to stun anything before. Mistletoe. Probably full of Nargles, though. What are Nargles? No idea. Well, how was it? Wet. I mean, she was sort of crying. That bad at it, are you? I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory. Cho spends half her time crying these days. You'd think a bit of snogging would cheer her up. Don't you understand how she must be feeling? Well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric... ...and confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him... ...conflicted because Umbridge might sack her mum from the Ministry... ...and frightened of failing her OWLs because she's worrying about everything. One person couldn't feel all that. They'd explode. Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon... Harry. Voldemort may be after something. Something he didn't have last time. Harry. Harry. In the dream, were you standing next to the victim... ...or looking down at the scene? Neither. It was like I... Will you please just tell me what's happening? Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight. Make sure he's found by the right people. - Sir. - Phineas. You must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place. Tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured... ...and his children will be arriving there soon by Portkey. They've got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it. What's more, the Dark Lord failed to acquire it. Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to... Look at me! What's happening to me? You wished to see me, headmaster? Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning. Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable. It appears there's a connection... ...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own. Whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is, for the moment, unclear. Pray he remains ignorant. You mean, if he knows about it, then... ...he'll be able to read my mind? - Read it, control it... ...unhinge it. In the past, it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure... ...to invade the minds of his victims... ...creating visions designed to torture them into madness. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony... ...only when he had them literally begging for death, would he finally... ...kill them. Used properly, the power of Occlumency... ...will help shield you from access or influence. In these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind. You will attempt to resist. Prepare yourself. Legilimens. Concentrate, Potter. Focus. Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas. Here we go. Daddy's back. Sit down, everybody, sit down. That's it. Now, presents. - And a nice big box for Ron. - Big box for you. And... Fred and George. Come on, open up. - I want to see your faces. - Yes. - Try it on. - Thanks, Mum. It's perfect. - Just what he wanted, actually. - Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum. Come on, then, everybody. Let's clear this away. Oh, Harry, Harry. There you are. - Happy Christmas. - Thank you. - Lovely to have you with us. - Thank you. Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy. - Thank you. - Has everybody got? Fred? George? - Hermione. - A Christmas toast. To Mr. Harry Potter... ...without whom I would not be here. - Harry. - Harry. Harry. That is delicious. I shall be needing some more of that. Daddy, don't forget last Christmas. I can't understand why you don't want to wear it, Ronald. I look like a bloody idiot, that's why. No more than usual, Ron. I don't know why... Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass. Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord. Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike. - If my poor mistress only knew... - Kreacher! That's enough of your bile. Away with you! Of course, master. Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black. Sorry about that. He never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy. Not to me, anyway. What, you grew up here? This is my parents' house. I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order. About the only useful thing I've been able to do. This is the Black family tree. My deranged cousin. I hated the lot of them. My parents with their pure-blood mania. My mother did that after I ran away. Charming woman. I was 16. Where did you go? Round your dad's. I was always welcome at the Potters'. I see him so much in you, Harry. You are so very much alike. I'm not so sure. Sirius, when I was... When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching. I was the snake. And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office... ...there was a moment when I wanted to... This connection between me and Voldemort. What if the reason for it is that I am becoming more like him? I just feel so angry all the time. And what if, after everything that I've been through... ...something's gone wrong inside me? What if I'm becoming bad? I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. You're not a bad person. You're a very good person who bad things have happened to. You understand? Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We've all got both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are. Harry, time to go. When all this is over, we'll be a proper family. You'll see. Come on. Really? Harry. Harry. Hagrid's back. I'm sorry. I will say this one last time. I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been. I told you. I've been away for me health. - Your health? - Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know. Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh air must be difficult to come by. If I were you, I shouldn't get too used to being back. In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all. This is top-secret, right? Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants. Giants? You found them? Well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, see? I tried to convince them to join the cause. But I wasn't the only one that was trying to win them over. - Death Eaters? - Yes. Trying to persuade them to join You-Know-Who. - Did they? - I gave them Dumbledore's message. Suppose some of them remember he was friendly to them. I suppose. And they did this to you? Not exactly, no. Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog. It's changing out there. Just like last time. There's a storm coming, Harry. We'd all best be ready when she does. We have confirmed that 10 high-security prisoners... ...in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape. And of course, the Muggle prime minister has been alerted to the danger. We strongly suspect... ...that the breakout was engineered... ...by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban... ...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black... ...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange. Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen. He's gonna get us all killed just because he can't face the truth. Harry. I wanted to apologize. Now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don't add up. So, what I'm really trying to say is that I believe you. Neville? Fourteen years ago... ...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange... ...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents. She tortured them for information... ...but they never gave in. I'm quite proud to be their son. But I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet. We're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise. Make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember. Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus. George, your turn now. Expecto Patronum. A full-bodied Patronus is the most difficult to produce... ...but shield forms can also be equally useful against a variety of opponents. Wow, that was really good. Fantastic, Ginny. Just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused. So focus, Luna. Think of the happiest thing you can. Expecto Patronum. - I'm trying. - I know. It's good. This is really advanced stuff, guys. You're doing so well. Expecto Patronum. I'll make short work of this. Bombarda Maxima. Get them. Been watching them for weeks. And see, ""Dumbledore's Army""... ...proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius. All your fear-mongering about You-Know-Who... ...never fooled us for a minute. We saw your lies for what they were: A smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry. Naturally. No, professor. He had nothing to do with it. It was me. Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as has been pointed out... ...the parchment clearly says ""Dumbledore's Army,"" not ""Potter's."" I instructed Harry to form this organization. And I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities. Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet. If we hurry, we should still make the morning edition. Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you will escort Dumbledore... ...to Azkaban... ...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition. I thought we might hit this little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I'm going to... What was the phrase? - Come quietly. Well, I can tell you this: I have no intention of going to Azkaban. Enough of this. Take him. Well, you may not like him, minister... ...but you can't deny... ...Dumbledore has got style. Boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other. Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit... Students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities. Any student in noncompliance will be expelled. Harry. You did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag. Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming. Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours. Yeah, we talked you into it. Yeah, but I agreed. I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is make things worse. Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore. Because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much. And the more you care, the more you have to lose. - So maybe it's just better to... - To what? To go it alone. Hagrid. Any idea where he's taking us? Hagrid, why can't you just tell us? I've never seen the centaurs so riled. And they're dangerous at the best of times. The Ministry restricts their territory much more... ...they'll have a full uprising on their hands. Hagrid, what's going on? I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three. I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it, but with Dumbledore gone... ...I'll likely be getting the sack any day now. And I just couldn't leave without telling someone about him. Grawpy. Down here, you great buffoon. Grawpy. Brought you some company. I couldn't just leave him, because... Because he's my brother. Blimey. Well, half brother, really. He's completely harmless, just like I said. Little high-spirited, is all. - Grawpy, that is not polite. - Hagrid, do something. We talked about this. You do not grab, do you? That's your new friend, Hermione. Grawpy. Grawp. Put me down. Now. You all right? Fine. Just needs a firm hand, is all. I think you've got an admirer. You just stay away from her, all right? He gets his own food and all. It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone. You will look after him, won't you? I'm the only family he's got. Feeling sentimental? - That's private. - Not to me. And not to the Dark Lord, if you don't improve. Every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you. You won't last two seconds if he invades your mind. You're just like your father. Lazy, arrogant. - Don't say a word against my father. - Weak. - I'm not weak. - Then prove it. Control your emotions. Discipline your mind. Legilimens. Harry. Sirius. I may vomit. Stop it. Is this what you call control? We've been at it for hours. If I could just rest. The Dark Lord isn't resting. You and Black, you're two of a kind. Sentimental children forever whining about how unfair your lives have been. Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair. Your blessed father knew that. In fact, he frequently saw to it. - My father was a great man. - Your father was a swine. - Legilimens. - Protego. Come on, Moony, Padfoot. Snape. Expelliarmus. Nice one, James. - Dad. - Impedimenta. Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy. Right. Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers? Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy. Enough. Enough. Your lessons are at an end. I... Get out. - What's your name? - Michael. Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael. Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See? It's fading already. You can hardly see ours anymore, and the pain stops after a while. As I told you once before, Mr. Potter... ...naughty children deserve to be punished. You know, George... ...I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement. Fred, I've been thinking exactly the same thing. All right, professor! Here you go. Ready when you are. I need that prophecy. You'll have to kill me. Oh, I will. But first, you will fetch it for me. Crucio. Crucio. Sirius. Harry, are you sure? I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley. It's the door I've been dreaming about. I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before. Sirius said Voldemort was after something. Something he didn't have the last time, in the Department of Mysteries. Harry, please, just listen. What if Voldemort meant for you to see this? What if he's only hurting Sirius because he's trying to get to you? What if he is? I'm supposed to just let him die? Hermione, he's the only family I've got left. What do we do? We'll have to use the Floo Network. Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance. Not all of them. Alohomora. Alert the Order if you can. - Are you mental? We're going with you. - It's too dangerous. When are you going to get it into your head? We're in this together. That you are. Caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl. You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you? - No. - Liar. - You sent for me, headmistress? - Snape, yes. The time has come for answers, whether he wants to give them to me or not. Have you brought the Veritaserum? I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students. The last of it on Miss Chang. Unless you wish to poison him... And I assure you, I would have the greatest sympathy if you did. - I cannot help you. He's got Padfoot. He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden. Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What is he talking about, Snape? No idea. Very well. You give me no choice, Potter. As this is an issue of Ministry security... ...you leave me with... ...no alternative. The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue. That's illegal. What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him. Tell her, Harry! Tell me what? Well, if you won't tell her where it is... ...I will. Where what is? Dumbledore's secret weapon. How much further? Not far. It had to be somewhere students wouldn't find it accidentally. What are you doing? Improvising. Well? Where is this weapon? There isn't one, is there? You were trying to trick me. You know... ...I really hate children. You have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter. Lower your weapons. I warn you, under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence... Protego. How dare you? Filthy half-breed. Incarcerous. Please. Please stop it. Please. Now, enough. I will have order. You filthy animal. Do you know who I am? Leave him alone. It's not his fault. No, he doesn't understand. Potter, do something. Tell them I mean no harm. I'm sorry, professor. But I must not tell lies. What are you doing? I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge. Let me go! Thank you, Grawp. Hermione. Hermione, Sirius. - How'd you get away? - Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty. Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets. They told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves. That was clever, Ron. - Has been known to happen. - It was brilliant. So how are we getting to London? Look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you... ...but I've got you into enough trouble as it is. Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be about doing something real. Or was that all just words to you? Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate. So how are we going to get to London? We fly, of course. Department of Mysteries. This is it. Ninety-two. Ninety-three. Ninety-four. Ninety-five. - He should be here. - Harry. It's got your name on it. The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal... ...but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not. For neither can live while the other survives. Harry. Where's Sirius? You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams... ...and reality. You saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see. Now, hand me the prophecy. If you do anything to us, I'll break it. He knows how to play. Itty, bitty baby. Potter. Bellatrix Lestrange. Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad? Better, now they're about to be avenged. Now, let's everybody just calm down... ...shall we? All we want is that prophecy. Why did Voldemort need me to come and get this? You dare speak his name? You filthy half-blood! It's all right. He's just a curious lad, aren't you? Prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made. Which is lucky for you, really. Haven't you always wondered... ...the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord? Why he was unable to kill you... ...when you were just an infant? Don't you want to know the secret of your scar? All the answers are there, Potter, in your hand. All you have to do... ...is give it to me. Then I can show you everything. I've waited 14 years. I know. I guess I can wait a little longer. Now. Stupefy. Stupefy. Levicorpus. Petrificus Totalus. Well done, Neville. Stupefy. - Stupefy. - Stupefy. Stupefy. Reducto. Get back to the door. Department of Mysteries. They got that bit right, didn't they? The voices. Can you tell what they're saying? There aren't any voices, Harry. Let's get out of here. I hear them too. Harry, it's just an empty archway. Please, Harry. Get behind me. Did you actually believe... ...or were you truly naive enough to think... ...that children stood a chance against us? I'll make this simple for you, Potter. Give me the prophecy now... ...or watch your friends die. Don't give it to him, Harry. Get away from my godson. Now, listen to me. Take the others and get out of here. What? No, I'm staying with you. You've done beautifully. Now, let me take it from here. Black. Expelliarmus! Nice one, James. Avada Kedavra. No. No. I killed Sirius Black. - You coming to get me? - Crucio. You've got to mean it, Harry. She killed him. She deserves it. You know the spell, Harry. Do it. So weak. It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom. The Aurors are on their way. By which time I shall be gone, and you... ...shall be dead. You've lost, old man. Harry. So weak. So vulnerable. Look at me. Harry, it isn't how you are alike. It's how you are not. Harry? You're the weak one... ...and you'll never know love or friendship. And I feel sorry for you. You're a fool, Harry Potter. And you will lose everything. He's back. I know how you feel, Harry. No, you don't. It's my fault. No, the fault is mine. I knew it was only a matter of time... ...before Voldemort made the connection between you. I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year... ...he'd be less tempted, and therefore you might be more protected. The prophecy said: ""Neither one can live while the other one survives."" It means one of us is gonna have to kill the other, in the end. Yes. Why didn't you tell me? For the same reason you tried to save Sirius. The same reason your friends saved you. After all these years, after all you've suffered... ...I didn't want to cause you any more pain. I cared too much about you. How come you're not at the feast? Lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them. That's awful. Oh, it's all good fun. But as it's the last night, I really do need them back. Do you want any help finding them? I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry. Are you sure you don't want any help looking? That's all right. Anyway, my mum always said... ...the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding. I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me. What's that? That even though we've got a fight ahead of us... ...we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have. Yeah? Something worth fighting for., Surprise! Alex. Do not interrupt me when I'm daydreaming. When a zebra's in the zone, leave him alone. Come on, Marty. Just wanted to wish you a happy birthday. Hey, man, thanks. Hey, I got something stuck in my teeth. It's driving me crazy. Can you help me? Please? You came to the right place, my friend. Dr. Marty, D.D.S., is in the house. Please hop on top of my sterilized examination table, if you may. - I don't see anything. - It's on the left. Oh, sorry. Okay, just don't talk with your mouth full. Right here. What the heck is this doing in there? Happy birthday! Aw, hey, thanks, man. You put it in behind the tooth. You all right. These aren't even on the shelf yet. Here. Check it out. - Look at that. Ooh! Look at that. - Look at that. It's snowing. Ten years old, huh? A decade. Double digits. The big 1-0. You don't like it? - No, no, it's great. - You hate it. I should've gotten you the Alex alarm clock. That's the big seller. No, no, no. The present's great, really. It's just that another year's come and gone and I'm still doing the same old thing. ""Stand over here. Trot over there. Eat some grass. Walk back over here."" - I see your problem. - Maybe I should go to law school. You just need to break out of that boring routine. - How? - Throw out the old act. Who knows what you'll do. Make it up as you go along. Ad lib. Improvise. On the fly. Boom, boom, boom. - Really? - You know, make it fresh. Fresh, huh? Okay. I could do fresh. Works for me. Here come the people, Marty. I love the people. It's fun people fun time! Let's go, Gloria! Up and at 'em. We're open! What day is it? It's Friday. Field trip day. Yes, it's field trip day. Let's get up and go... ...in ten more minutes. Come on! Melman, Melman, Melman! Melman, Melman, Melman! Wake up! Rise and shine! It's another fabulous morning in the Big Apple. Let's go. - Not for me. I'm calling in sick. - What? I found another brown spot on my shoulder. Right here. See? Right there. You see? Melman, you know it's all in your head. Hm? Let's go! Come on! Phil! Wake up, you filthy monkey. Oh, I'm going to be fresh. Straight out the ground. Tasty fresh! Freshalicious. Ziploc fresh. Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, the Central Park Zoo proudly presents: Show them the cat. Who's the cat? The king of New York City. Alex the lion. It's showtime. Roar! Gather around, people. Big show about to start. Check out the zebra taking care of biz. That's right. Just smile and wave, boys. Smile and wave. Kowalski, progress report. We're 500 feet from the main sewer line. - And the bad news? - We've broken our last shovel. Right. Rico, you're on litter patrol. We need shovels. And find more Popsicle sticks. We don't want to risk another cave-in. And me, skipper? I want you to look cute and cuddly, private. Today we're going to blow this dump. Come here. Come here. Come on, penguin. Yeah! You don't see that on Animal Planet. Ha-ha. Well, show's over, folks. Thanks for coming. I hope you thought it was fresh. I'll be here all week. In fact, I'll be here for my whole life. Three hundred and sixty-five days a year, including Christmas, Hanukkah, Halloween, Kwanzaa. Please don't forget to never spay or neuter your pets. And tip your cabbie, because he's broke. You, quadruped. Sprechen sie Englisch? I sprechen. - What continent is this? - Manhattan. Hoover Dam! We're still in New York. Abort. Dive! Dive! Dive. Hey. You in the tux. Wait a minute. What are you guys doing? We're digging to Antarctica. Ant-who-tica? Can you keep a secret, my monochromatic friend? Do you ever see any penguins running free around New York City? Of course not. We don't belong here. It's just not natural. This is all some kind of whacked-out conspiracy. We're going to the wide-open spaces of Antarctica. To the wild. The wild? You could actually go there? That sounds great. Hey, hold up. Where is this place? Tell me where it is. You didn't see anything. Right? Yes, sir. I'm sorry. No, sir. For his final appearance of the day, the king of New York City. Alex the lion. Roar! Thank you. Thank you very much. You guys are great. You're a great crowd. Give yourselves a hand. Thank you. Oh. Thank you. Oh! Well. Thank you. Oh, that's too kind. Too kind. Underpants! Everybody get home safe. Hey! Check out my Web site. Twenty-four hour Alex Cam. Watch me sleep. This is the life. That's the spot. Oh! I'm in heaven. - Ooh, it's Marty's birthday. - Just rip it open. - What is it? - Come on. Open it up. What you got? A thermometer. Thanks. I love it, Melman. I love it. I wanted to give you something personal. That was my first rectal thermometer. - Mother... - I'll miss that bad boy. Get the cake. Melman, come on. Happy birthday to you You live in a zoo You look like a monkey And you smell like one too I say. Aw, well, now, you guys are just embarrassing me. And yourselves. What? We worked on that all week. Let's go. Let's make a wish, babycakes. - What'd you wish for? - Nope. Can't tell you that. Come on. Tell. No siree. I'm telling you, it's bad luck. You want some bad luck, I'll blab it out. But if you want to be safe, I'll keep my mouth shut. Would you just tell us? What could happen? Okay. I wished I could go to the wild! The wild?! I told you it was bad luck. The wild? Are you nuts? That is the worst idea I've ever heard. It's unsanitary. The penguins are going. So why can't I? The penguins are psychotic. Come on. Just imagine going back to nature. Back to your roots. Clean air, wide-open spaces! I hear there's wide-open spaces in Connecticut. - Connecticut? - You got to go over to Grand Central. Then you got to take the Metro-North train... north? So one could take the train? Just hypothetically. Come on. What would Connecticut have to offer us? - Lyme disease. - Thank you, Melman. No, I just want... There's none of this in the wild. This is a highly refined type of food thing that you do not find in the wild. You ever thought there might be more to life than steak, Alex? He didn't mean that, baby. No, no, no. Doesn't it bother you guys that you don't know anything about life outside this zoo? - Nuh-uh. Nope. - Mm-mm. Well, I mean, come on. That's just one subject. You got a little schmutz right there on your... Thanks, guys. Thanks for the party. It was great. Really. What's eating him? Maybe you should talk to him. Go over and give him a little pep talk. Hey, I already gave him a snow globe. I can't top that. I can see where this is going. It is getting late. I guess I'm going to... Come on. He's your best friend. All right, all right. Okay. - Night, Marty. - Night, Glo. What a day. I mean, I tell you, it just doesn't get any better than this, you know? Ooh! It just did. Even the star's out. Not going to find a star like that in the wild. Helicopter. Marty. Buddy. Listen. Everybody has days when they think the grass might be greener somewhere else. Alex. Look at me. I'm ten years old. My life is half over. And I don't even know if I'm black with white stripes... ...or white with black stripes. Marty. I'm thinking of a song. Alex. Please. Not now. Oh, yes. It's a wonderful song. I think you're familiar with it. Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't. No, no, no. I'm not listening. Start spreadin' the news I don't know you. I'm leaving today - We are a great big part of it - He's funny. Who is that? Come on. You know you know the words. Two little words. New York. New York Shut up, shut up, shut up! Hey, I'm sleeping here! We're not all nocturnal, you know! I'll knock your ""turnal"" right off, pal. Yeah, you and what army, stripes? You mess with him, you mess with me, Howard. - You're a bigmouth lion. - See? Mr. Grumpy Stripes. We make a great team, the two of us. We sure do. No doubt about it. So, what are you going to do? Go running off to the wild by yourself? - No. - Good. You and me. Let's go. - What? - The wild. Come on. You and me together. It's a straight shot down Fifth Avenue to Grand Central. We'll grab a train, we'll head north. We can be back by morning. No one will ever know. You're joking. Right? Yeah. I'm joking. Of course I'm joking. Give me a break. Like we're going to get a train. Don't do that. You really had me worried there. Oh, well. I guess I'll hit the sack. Yeah, me too. I'll need to rest my voice for tomorrow. It's Seniors' Day, you know. Have to roar extra loud. Give them a little jolt. You know? Good night, Ally Al. They forgot to turn off the ambience again. Don't worry. It's cool. You know, I got it. Much better. Come on, now, baby. My little filet. My little filet mignon with a little fat around the edges. I like that. I like a little fat on my steak. My sweet, juicy steak. You are a rare delicacy. Alex. Alex. Alex! What? What? You suck your thumb? What is it, Melman? You know how I have that bladder infection and I have to get up every two hours? I got up to pee and looked over at Marty's pen, which I usually don't do. I don't know why, but I did. And... What? What's going on? It's Marty. He's gone. Gone! What do you mean, ""gone""? How long has he been working on this? Marty! Marty! He wouldn't fit down there. Marty? Marty! Marty! This doesn't make any sense. Where would he go? - Connecticut! - He wouldn't. Oh, no! What are we going to do? I mean, we got to call somebody! Hello? Get me Missing Animals. And hurry. We've got a lost zebra probably on the way to Connecticut, and we need... - Hello? Hello? - Wait a second. - We can't call the people. - What the...? They'll be really mad. It'll get Marty transferred for good. Don't bite the hand that feeds you. Mm-hm, I know that's right. We got to go after him. He's not thinking straight. Let's stop him from making the biggest mistake of his life. He's probably out there lost and cold, confused. Poor little guy. Come on. One of us should wait here in case he comes back. Not now. This is an intervention. We all got to go. What's the fastest way to Grand Central? - You should take Lexington. - Melman! - Okay. ""We."" We should take Lexington. - What about Park? No, Park goes two ways. You can't time the lights. I heard Tom Wolfe is speaking at Lincoln Center. Well, of course we're going to throw poo at him. We should've taken Park. You sure this is the fastest way to Grand Central Station? I don't know! That's what Melman said. Hey. Hey, you, guys. That room has some nifty little sinks you can wash up in, and look! Free mints! This isn't a field trip. This is an urgent mission to save Marty from throwing his life away. Now, where's the train? Here it comes. What did Marty say to you? I asked you to talk to him. I did! I did! I don't understand. He said, ""Let's go."" I said, ""Are you crazy?"" He says, ""I'm ten years old."" And he has black-and-white stripes, and so then we sang and... What you got to do is go straight back down West 42nd. It's on your left after Vanderbilt. If you hit the Chrysler Building, you've gone too far. Thanks a lot, officer. Hey! Wait for the light. Freak. - Did you say ""zebra""? - That's right. A zebra. Right in front of me. - Can I shoot it? - Negative. Then I'm going to need some backup. - Aw! Knicks lost again. - What are you going to do. Did that say ""Grand Central Station"" or ""my aunt's constipation""? This is it. Grand Central Station. It's grand and it's central. Move aside. We have an emergency here. This is an emergency situation. Hey, hey. Just chill out. It's not that big of an emergency. Upstairs, downstairs. How do you like that? Lady! What is wrong with you? Ow! Get a grip on yourselves, people. You're a bad kitty. Dagnabbit! I missed the express. Looks like I'll have to take the Stamford local. I got him! I've got him! He's got him! He's got him! He's got him! He's got... I got something for you! I'm okay. I'm okay. Whoa! What are you guys doing here? - I am so glad we found you. - We were so worried about you. Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine. Look at me. I'm fine. You're fine? Oh, he's fine. Oh, great. You hear that? Marty's fine. That's good to know. Because I was wondering... How could you do this to us? I thought we were your friends! What's the big deal? I was coming back. Don't ever do this again. Do you hear me? - Do you hear him? - Guys, we're running out of time. Oh, Melman, you broke their clock? ...do this again! Don't you ever, ever do this again! Come here. We've been ratted out, boys. Hold your fire! Cute and cuddly, boys. Cute and cuddly. If you have any poo, fling it now. It's the Man. Good evening, officers. No. No. No. You don't talk now. Okay? You're not good with the ""putting words together and their coming out good"" thing. You keep it ""shh."" Hey! How you doing? You know what? Everything's cool. We just had a little situation here. Little internal situation. My friend went a little crazy. Happens to everybody. The city gets to us all. Went a little cuckoo in the head. Don't be calling me cuckoo in the head. Just shush! I will handle this. Oh! I got him! Go, go, go! Right here, please. Would you give a guy a break? We'll take my little friend home and forget this ever happened. All right? No harm, no foul, right? Hey, it's cool. It's me, Alex the lion. From the zoo. What's the matter with them? I feel really, really weird. I love you guys. I love you so much. Last night's dramatic incident in Grand Central is an example of what animal rights wackos have been shouting for years: Animals clearly don't belong in captivity. They are to be sent back to their natural habitat, where they will live their lives in the freedom they desire. - Hey. Little help? - He's awake! He's awake! Do something! Oh, man. Oh, my head. What the...? Wait. Where? What? I'm in a box! Oh, no. No, no! Not the box. Oh, no, they can't transfer me. Not me! Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Darkness creeping in. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Walls closing in around me. So alone. So alone. - Alex! Alex, are you there? - Marty? - Yeah! Talk to me, buddy. - Oh, Marty! You're here! - What's going on? You okay? - This doesn't look good. - Alex, Marty, is that you? - Gloria! - You're here too! - I am loving the sound of your voice. - What is going on? - We're all in crates. Oh, no! - Sleeping just knocks me out. - Melman! Is that Melman? - Are you okay? - Yeah. No, I'm fine. I often doze off while I'm getting an MRI. - You're not getting an MRI. - CAT scan? No CAT scan. It's a transfer. It's a zoo transfer. Zoo transfer?! Oh, no. No, no, I can't be transferred. I have an appointment with Dr. Goldberg at 5:00. There are prescriptions that have to be filled. No other zoo could afford my medical care. And I am not going HMO. Take it easy, Melman. It's going to be okay. - We are going to be okizay. - No, we're not going to be okizay. Now, because of you, we're ruined! Because of me? I fail to see how this is my fault. - You're kidding, right, Marty? - You. You ticked off the people. You bit the hand, Marty. You bit the hand. ""I don't know who I am. I got to go find myself in the wild."" Oh, please. I did not ask you to come after me, did I? He does have a point. I did say we should stay at the zoo, but you guys... Melman, just shut it. You suggested this idea to him in the first place. - Leave Melman out of this. - Thank you, Gloria. Besides, it's not my fault that we were transferred. Melman, shut it. Does anybody feel nauseous? - I feel nauseous. - Melman, you always feel nauseous. Progress report. It's an older code, skipper. I can't make it out. You, higher mammal. Can you read? No. Phil can read, though. Phil. Ship to Kenya. Wildlife preserve. Africa! Africa? That ain't going to fly. Rico. I was the star in the greatest city on Earth. - Guys, listen. - A king. Loved by my people. - Let's be civil. - And you've ruined everything! ""Loved""? If the people loved you, it's only because they didn't know the real you! Don't make me come up there. I'll whoop both of y'all. I thought I knew the real you! Your black-and-white stripes, they cancel each other out. You're nothing! Stop it, stop it, stop it! You're not helping the situation. Status. It's no good. I don't know the codes. Don't give me excuses. Give me results! Navigation. All right. Let me think. And shut him up! - I did it! - Let's get this tin can turned around. Guys? Oh, no.

Martin! - Hold up! - I'm going to kill you! - Come here! Don't run away from me! - Calm down! If you keep running, I'm going to just kill you more! Oh, look at us. We're all here together. Safe and sound. Yeah, here we are. Where exactly is ""here""? San Diego. San Diego? White sandy beaches, cleverly simulated natural environment, wide-open enclosures. I'm telling you, this could be the San Diego Zoo. Complete with fake rocks. Wow, that looks real. San Diego? What could be worse than San Diego? I don't know. This place is crackalacking! Oh, I could hang here. I could hang here. - I'll kill you! - Take it easy! - Strangle you! - Calm down. Then bury you, dig you up, clone you and kill your clones. - 20-second timeout. - I'll never talk to you again. Now, look. We're just going to find the people, get checked in and have this mess straightened out. Oh, great. This is just great. San Diego. Now I'll have to compete with Shamu and his smug little grin. I can't top that. Can't top it. I'm ruined! I'm done. I'm out of the business. It's your fault, Marty! You've ruined me. Come on, Alex. Do you honestly think I intended all of this to happen? You want me to say that I'm sorry? Is that what you want? Okay, I'm... He just shushed me. Marty, look, you've got to be just a little bit more und... - Don't you shush me. - Do you hear that? Don't you hear that? - I hear it now. - Where there's music, there's people. - Go to the head honcho. - A sidewalk would be nice. Yeah, what a dump. They should call it the San Di-lame-o Zoo. First they tell you, ""We got this great open plan thing. Let animals run wild."" Next thing, flowers in your hair, everybody's hugging everybody. This place kind of grows on you. This way, guys! Come on! What the...? Oh, no! Okay, let's make a good impression on the people. Smiles, everyone. Let's get it together. - Is that the best you can do? - Oh, I'm not smiling. It's gas. Well, great. Let's make gas look good. - Wow! - It's not people. It's animals. California animals. Dude. This is like a Puffy party. I like to move it, move it I like to move it, move it - Ya like to - Move it I like to move it, move it I like to move it, move it I like to move it, move it - Ya like to - Move it I like to move it, move it You like to move it, move it She like to move it, move it - He like to - Move it All girls all over the world Original King Julien 'pon yer case, man I love how all the girls that love to move their body When ya move your body, ya do Move it nice and sweet and sassy, all right What kind of zoo is this? I just saw 26 blatant health code violations. I'm loving San Diego. This place is off the chizain. Twenty-seven. Woman, physically fit, physically fit Physically, physically, physically fit Physically fit, Physically fit We should've brought chips and dip. Wait. Where's Alex? What happened to him? He was right behind us. Wasn't he? I don't know where he's at, but he's missing one heck of a party. The fossa! The fossa! The fossa are attacking! Run for your lives! - Fossa hungry. - Fossa eat. I hate spiderwebs. Yeah, thanks a lot, guys. Thanks for waiting up. Really appreciate it. Hey, hi. We just got in from New York, and we're looking for a supervisor. Because we've been sitting on that beach back there for hours, and nobody's even bothered to show up. I don't know how things are normally run around here, but there's been some sort of major screwup, which is cool. So if you could point us towards the administrative offices, we'll... Well, howdy-do. Spider! Spider! Spider on my back! Maurice, did you see that? He scared the fossa away. Come on, Gloria. Get it. Get it! Get it! Get it! - That's it! Smack it! - Get it, get it! Whip it! Whip it good! Where'd it go? King Julien, what are they? What are they?! They are aliens. Savage aliens from the savage future. They've come to kill us. And take our women. And our precious metals. Get up, Mort. Do not be near the king's feet, okay? We're hiding. Be quiet, everyone. Including me. Who's making that noise? Oh, it's me again. There it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria! - Enough! Enough with the stick. - I think she got it. Is it still on me? I hate spiders. It's okay. It's gone. They are savages. Tonight we die. The feet. I told you... I told you to... I told every... Didn't I tell him about the feet? He did tell you about the feet. - Wait. I have a plan. - Really? I have devised a cunning test to see whether these are savage killers. Hi there. You let me handle it. Alex handles it. Marty does nothing. Hi there. Oh, jeez. Sorry. - Oh, Alex, what'd you do? - Stop. Stop. It's okay. It's okay. I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion. Oh, jeez! - Aw, Alex! - Oh, you poor little baby. Did that big mean lion scare you? He did? He's a big, bad old puddy tat, isn't he? Come on. Mama'll hold you. Awww, look at you. They are so cute from a reasonable distance. Aren't you the sweetest little thing. I just want to dunk him in my coffee. They're just a bunch of pansies. I don't know. There's something about that one with the crazy hairdo that I find suspicious. Nonsense, Maurice. Come on, everybody. Let's go and meet the pansies! Presenting your royal highness, our illustrious King Julien XIII, self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs, et cetera. Hooray, everybody. He's got style. What is he, like, king of the guinea pigs? I think it's a squirrel. Welcome, giant pansies. Please feel free to bask in my glow. - Definitely a squirrel. - Yep. Squirrel. We thank you with enormous gratitude for chasing away the fossa. - The ""whossa""? - The fossa. They annoy us by trespassing, interrupting our parties - and ripping our limbs off. - Good. We're just trying to find out where the people are, so... What big teeth you have. Man! Shame on you, Maurice. Can you not see that you have insulted the freak? You must tell me, who the heck are you? I'm Alex. The Alex. And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman. And just where are you giants from? We're from New York and... All hail the New York giants! New York giants! Is this some sort of inbreeding program? I say we just got to ask these bozos where the people are. Excuse me. We bozos have the people, of course. Hey, the bozos have the people. Oh, well, great. Good. Phew. They're up there. Don't you love the people? Not a very lively bunch, though. Wow. So do you have any live people? No. Only dead ones. I mean, if we had a lot of live people here, it wouldn't be called the wild, would it? The wild? Whoa. Hold up there a second, fuzzbucket. You mean, like, the ""live in a mud hut, wipe yourself with a leaf"" type wild? - Who wipes? - Oy vey. - Oy vey! - Oy vey, everybody! Oy vey! Could you excuse me for a moment? Get me out of here! We got to get out of here! - Help! - What are you doing?! I'm swimming back to New York. I know my chances are slim, but I have to try! - You can't swim! - I said my chances are slim! Nature! It's all over me! Get it off! I can't see! I can't see! I can see! Look. There's obviously just been a little mistake. The people didn't dump us here on purpose. As soon as they realize what happened, they'll come looking for us, right? Yeah, right. I don't know the words But we're born free You know something? I bet they're already on their way. Well, boys, it's going to be ice-cold sushi for breakfast. Rico. Well, since I'm doomed to die on this forsaken island, I, Melman Mankiewicz, being of sound mind and unsound body, have divided my estate equally among the three of you. Sorry, Alex. Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman. Outdoor plumbing. No, it's not a latrine. It's a grave. You sent Melman to his grave. Are you happy? Aw, come on. This isn't the end. This is a whole new beginning. This could be the best that's happened. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. This is not the best thing that's happened to us. You abused the power of the birthday wish and brought bad luck on all of us. Why'd you tell your wish? You're not supposed to. I didn't want to tell you. Remember? - You guys made me tell you. - Oh, okay. Besides, this isn't bad luck. This is good luck. Look around. There's no fences, no schedules. This place is beautiful. Baby, we were born... Okay. Okay. I've had enough of this. This is your side of the island, and this is our side of the island. That is the bad side, where you can prance and skip like a magical pixie horse and do whatever the heck you want. This is the good side for those who love New York and care about going home. - Come on. - No, no. Back! Back! You know what? This isn't good. Okay! You all have your side, and I'll have mine. And if you need me, I'll be over here, on the fun side of the island, having a good old time. This is the fun side, where we'll have a great time surviving until we go home. - A yabbadabbado old time! - This side's the best. That side stinks! You're on the Jersey side of this cesspool! - Wilma! - Now what do we do? Don't worry. I have a plan to get us rescued. Can't wait to see the look on Marty's face when he sees this. Just look at him. He's helpless without us. Shut up, Spalding. I've been standing here for hours, man. How long do I have to pose like this? She is finito. I defy any rescue boat within a million miles to miss this baby. When the moment is right, we will ignite the beacon of liberty and be rescued from this awful nightmare! What do you think? Pretty cool, huh? - How's the liberty fire going, Melman? - Great. Idiot. I heard that. Why can't we just borrow some of Marty's fire? That's wild fire. We're not using wild fire on Lady Liberty. - Now, rub, Melman. - I've been doing... I can't. I can't. I can't do it. I ju... I can't do it! Fire. Fire. Fire! Fire! Oh, my Fire! Not yet! No, no! No! Fire! Melman, hold still! Jump! Alex, jump! Don't worry, cats always land on their... Face? Man, what kind of cat are you? You maniac! You burned it up! Darn you! Darn you all to heck! Can we go to the fun side now? Everybody, calm down. Come on. Into your chairs. Everybody, calm down. Let go of his tail. Separate those two, would you, please? You here, you there. Everyone... Calm down, people, okay? Now, presenting your royal highness, the illustrious blah, blah, blah. You know, et cetera, et cetera. Hooray. Let's go. Now, everybody, we all have great curiosity about our guests, the New York giants. - Yes, Willie? - I like them. I like them. I liked them first. Before I even met them I liked them. I liked them right away. You hate them compared to how much I like them. Oh, shut up. You're so annoying! Now, for as long as we can remember, we have been attacked and eaten by the dreaded fossa. The fossa! The fossa are attacking! It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook! Please. Maurice. Quiet! Come on, y'all. They're not attacking us this very instant. So my genius plan is this: We will make the New York giants our friends and keep them close. Then, with Mr. Alex protecting us, we will be safe and never have to worry about the dreaded fossa ever again. I thought of that. I thought of that. Yes. Me. I did. Hold on, everybody. Hold on. I'm just thinking now. I mean, does anyone wonder why the fossa were so scared of Mr. Alex? I mean, maybe we should be scared too. What if Mr. Alex is even worse than the fossa? I tell you, that dude just gives me the heebiedabajeebies. Maurice, you did not raise your hand. Therefore, your heinous comment will be stricken from the record. Does anyone else have the heebie-jeebies? No? Good. So shut up. When the New York giants wake up, we will make sure that they wake up in paradise. Now, who would like a cookie? Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria are over there having a good time. There's room on the fun side for one more. No, thanks. Look, I've been thinking. Maybe if you gave this place a chance, I don't know, you might even enjoy yourself. Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry. I just want to go home. Could you just give it a chance? Think about it. It really isn't the fun side without you. I know. And then... - It's him. - Who is it? It's the pizza man. Who the heck do you think it is? Yes? Can I help you? Can I come to the fun side? Beg your pardon? You know, I've been kind of a jerk. But I've been thinking about what you said, and I'm sorry. Welcome to Casa del Wild. Take a load off. Hey, hey, wipe your feet. - Alex! - Mi casa is su casa. Very impressive. Hey, have a drink. It's on the house. This is seawater. Oh, you don't swallow it. It's just temporary till the plumbing's done. Hey, y'all look hungry. How would you like some of nature's goodness? You have food? The Fun Side Special, coming up. Seaweed on a stick. Seaweed? On a stick. Don't love it till you try it. That's unbelievable. - So good. - Well, thanks. It does kind of hit the spot, doesn't it? Well, maybe it could use a little lemon. No, it's great. It's really great. Doesn't get any better than this. Oh, but it does. Check this out. Wow. Would you look at that. It's like billions and billions of helicopters. It's a shooting star. Make a wish. Quick! Ooh! How about a thick, juicy steak? You know what, Alex? I promise you I'm going to find you a steak tomorrow if it kills me. Thanks, Marty. It is getting late. I guess I'm going to... I think I'm going to hit the sack too. Sweet dreams, everyone. Alex. What are you doing? Twenty-seven, 28, 29. Thirty black and only 29 white. Looks like you're black with white stripes after all. Dilemma solved. Good night. You see, Maurice, Mr. Alex was grooming his friend. He is clearly a tender, loving thing. How can you have the heebie-jeebies for Mr. Alex? Look at him. He's so cute and plushy. I don't think he was grooming him. Look more like he was tasting him to me. Suit yourself, no matter. I don't care. Soon we will put my excellent plan to action. All we have to do is wait until they are deep in their sleep. How long is this going to take?! Well, this sucks! Wake up, Mr. Alex. Wake up, Mr. Alex. Rise and shining. Wakey-waking, Mr. Alex! Wake up! Alex! You suck your thumb? Where are we? What the heck is going on? Where's the beach? Take it easy. - Who built a forest? - Don't be alarmed, giant freaks. While you were asleep, we simply took you to our little corner of heaven. Welcome to Madagascar. - Mada-who-ah? - What? No, not whooha. Ascar. Marty. It's... Just like my mural back at the zoo. Oh, no, fella, that is the real deal right there. Look at that, that's not a bad view. That's the thing that you were always looking at, but it's actually there. - That's the real version of... - How about once around the park? Let's get our blood pumping, lungs breathing this fresh air. Who's with me?! Naw. I don't think I could... You're it! Hey! Want to play around? Got you there! Come here! You're it. Hey, stop that! Hey, you're crazy! Okay, Marty, I'm it. I'm it. I'm it. You win. Come on, Alex, get in the groove. I haven't eaten in two days. My blood sugar's real low. I just don't have the energy. I don't think that's your problem. First of all, that's not how you run in the wild. Let's go. Put the rubber to the road! You just have to let out that inner lion. - Now, who's the cat? - Marty, I really don't... You are, that's who. Come on! Here we go! That's it. Let's build up some steam! You the cat. - Who's the cat? - You the cat. - Who's the cat? - You the cat. Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat? I'm the cat! Surprise! You're it. You're it! Can't juke the cat. Cat's too quick. I feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye on the fly from the deli in the sky! - Let's go wild! - Now you're talking! Man! I feel different. Noogie, noogie, noogie. Noogie, noogie, noogie! Kind of charged up or something. - Like you said, baby, it's... - Crackalacking. - Ain't that right, Melman? - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm in heaven. You see, Maurice, Alex is now our friend and the fossas are nowhere to be seen. It could be said that my plan is working in a very good working kind of way. Alex. You got to try some of this. I feel good. Feel like a king again. King? You should see his act. Come on, Alex, why don't you show him some of your act. Oh. No, I really don't think I could... Okay. Ladies and gentlemen. Primates of all ages. The wild proudly presents: The king. Alex the lion! E flat, fellas. Yeah! The king is in the house! See, if he is the king, then where is his crown? I've got a crown. Got a very nice one. And it's here on my head. Look at it. Have I got it on? Do the roar, man. Do the roar. Wow. I've never heard that one before. Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on! Break out the wave! Excuse me. You're biting my butt. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. - What did you do? - You just bit me! No. I didn't. Did I? You kind of did. What the heck is wrong with you? Why'd you bite me? - Man, it's because you are his dinner. - What?! - Excuse me? - That's dumb. Come, come, Maurice. What is a simple bite on the buttocks among friends? Here, give me a nibble. The party is over, Julien. Your brilliant plan has failed. What are you talking about? Your friend here is what we call a deluxe-model hunting and eating machine. And he eats steak... ...which is you. - Get out of here. - Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it. The plan failed. All is lost! We're all doomed. The fossas will come back and gobble us with their mouths because... ...we are all steak. I'm steak! Me, me, me! Mr. Alex cannot stay here. He belongs with his own kind on the fossa side of the island. By the power vested in me, by the law of the jungle, blah, blah, blah, blah... Be gone! What? Come on, do I look like a steak to you? Yeah! See, I told you I don't look like a... Wait. What you say? Oh, yeah! - He's going savage. - Run for your lives. Marty, run! A bull's eye. Excellent shot, Maurice. Thank you. Marty? I'm so sorry, Marty. What is wrong with me? Ow. Oh, no. What have I done? It's true. I'm a monster. I got to get out of here. What have I done? This is a nightmare. And it's all my fault. Now, because of me, we've lost Alex. Well, what are we going to do? We'll find a way to help him. That's what we'll do. Okay. Come on, we are New Yorkers, right? We're tough. We're gritty. We're adaptable! And we are not going to lay down like a bunch of Melmans. No, we're not. Oh. Gloria. That was not me, okay? That was the boat. - The boat! - The boat? The boat's come back for us! Come on, guys, we got to flag it down. There it is! - Hey, over here! - Over here! Over here! Yo! Melman, give me a lift. Hurry up! Lift me up! Help! Help! Help! - Oh, my neck. My neck. You guys. - Over here! - Melman! Steady. This way! - You have no idea how much this hurts. Hey, boat! We're over here! Look! It's turning! It's coming back! It's coming back! Come on! Come on, baby! Yes! You guys. You flag down that boat. I'll get Alex. Whoa! Hold on there. You cannot go back there by yourself. Aw, come on. I know Alex. He hears we're rescued, he'll snap right out of it. The people are coming. They can help us. Melman's right. The people will know what to do. Now, we got to flag down that boat. Now, this is more like it. You?! Oh, ma... Where are the people? We killed them and ate their livers. Got you, didn't I? Just kidding, doll, the people are fine. They're on a slow lifeboat to China. Hey, I know you two. Where's that psychotic lion and our monochromatic friend? Marty? He's righ... Where did he go? He was right behind us. He went back for Alex. He's going to get himself killed! Well, boys, our monochromatic friend's in danger. Looks like we have a job to do. Captain's log: Embarking into hostile environment. Kowalski. We'll need to win the hearts and the minds of the natives. Rico. We'll need special tactical equipment. We're going to face extreme peril. Private probably won't survive. Alex! Come out, Alex! The boat's here! We can go home! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Marty? Snap out of it, Alex. The boat came back. We can get out of here. We can go back to civilization, and everything will be like it used to be. Stay back. Please. I'm a monster. Alex, you're no monster. You're my friend. We're a team. You and me, remember? I don't want to hurt you. Alex. I ain't leaving without you. Alex? I'm thinking of a song. It's a wonderful song. I'm sure you're familiar with it. Start spreadin' the news I'm leaving today We are a great big part of it Come on, you know the words. Two little words. Please don't make me sing this by myself. You really don't want to hear me sing this by myself. Uh, Alex? Could you come out here for a minute? Hey, Alex, a little help. Help me! Alex! Help! Help me! Anybody, help me! Somebody! Help! - Melman? - That's right, baby. Run! - What's the plan? - This is the plan. - Fossa hungry. - Fossa eat. This is the plan? Fossa halt. Fossa ooh. Fossa aaahh. Fossa ooh. Fossa aaahh. Come and get it. Fossa. - Take that. - Fossa ow! There's too many of them, skipper. It's been a real pleasure serving with you boys. Alex? That's my kill. Mine. Alex hungry. Alex eat. It's showtime. Thanks for not giving up on me. Man, you almost gave me a heart attack. You can't just come sneak up on me. Just because you're a lion... Let go of me. Let go of me. We're getting out of here. Guys, just go with me on this. Like I said, it's showtime. Mine. My kill. They're all mine. It's the king of the beasts! Oh, no! - Don't eat me! - He's big and scary! Fear me! Savagery beyond comprehension. - I am far too young to die! - You're a monster! A monster, I say! - And, you! - Me? Oh, you want some of this? Ooh! You better run for your lives. - Somebody call a cop! - He's psychotic! This is my territory. Understand? I never, ever want to see you on my turf again. Boo. Yeah! You the cat! Got my boy back! I did it! Give me some love! The plan worked! The plan worked! I'm very clever! I'm the one, baby! Come on. Time to robot. I am very clever king. I am super genius. I am robot king of the monkey things. - Compute, compute. - So, what's for lunch? - Close those eyes. - Why do I have to? - Do it. - They're closed. - Tighter. - Yes, sir. - No peeking. - They're closed. Rico. Hai. Open that hatch. Fire in the hole. Now chew. Chew like you mean it. Savor it. - And? - Well? Pretty good, right? There's always Plan B. This is better than steak. I love it. I love it! The kitty loves the fishy. Well, I propose a toast. Now, he may be a pain in the butt at times... And trust me, I know. But this cat proved to me without a doubt that his heart is bigger than his stomach. - To Alex. - To Alex. Enough! Stop it! What do you think? Should we head back to New York? I don't know. I mean, this is your dream. You sure you want to leave? I don't care where we are. As long as we're together, it doesn't matter to me. Well, in that case... Yo. Rico. I'll take 300 orders to go. Hai. But before you leave, I have an announcement to make. So shut up, everyone, please. Thank you. After much deep and profound brain things inside my head, I have decided to thank you for bringing peace to our home. And to make you feel good, I'm going to give you this lovely parting gift. No, I couldn't. Really, I can't take your crown. That's okay, I've got a bigger crown. It's got a gecko on it. Look at him shake. Go, Stevie, go! - Bye, little fuzzbuckets! - Thanks for everything! - Bye, little fuzzbuckets! - Thanks for everything! - So long! - Bye-bye, now. - Arrivederci. - Bye-bye. - Toodle-oo! - See you later, crocodile. Maurice, my arm is tired. Wave it for me. Faster, you naughty little monkey. By the time we get back to New York, it'll be the middle of winter. So I was just thinking, why rush? Maybe we could make a few side stops along the way. - Maybe Paris. - You just read my mind. - I was thinking Spain. - Run with the bulls. - What about Fiji? - Canada. Can we? Cheap meds. I wouldn't even mind coming back here sometime. - I could do that. - You could say that again. - Skipper? - I always wanted to go to Australia. Don't you think we should tell them that the boat's out of gas? Nah. Just smile and wave, boys. Smile and wave. Subtitles by LeapinLar, --spring training camp and he's definitely got the inside track. Word is that they're having some problems with injuries. Really? Are they looking into... ... free-agent signings last second, anything like that? Possibly, and they've got a strong farm club too. They've got some triple-A ballplayers they might bring up. Peter would certainly be able to tell us more about that. Who do you like? So far, I like what I'm seeing in New York. They've got a strong ball club, as usual. That's in the American. And in the National, I'm still liking Chicago... ... with a little bit of a twist here for Los Angeles. Okay, so we're looking at New York-Chicago World Series... - ... possible Los Angeles. Could be a dark horse. Hold him to it at the end of the season. That's gonna do it for us from the Sports Desk. - Back to the studio. Thanks, Dave. Thanks for nothing, Eddie. Thank you, guys. That's not all we're following. Here's Karen at the Health Desk. The world of medicine has seen its share of miracle cures... ...from the polio vaccine to heart transplants... ...but all past achievements may pale in comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin. Thank you for joining us this morning. - Not at all. - So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell. Well, the premise is quite simple. Take something designed by nature and reprogram it... ...to make it work for the body rather than against it. - We're talking about a virus? - Yes. In this case, the measles virus... ...which has been engineered at a genetic level to be helpful rather than harmful. Um, I'm not... I find the best way to describe it is... ...if you can imagine your body as a highway... ...and you picture the virus as a very fast car being driven by a very bad man... ...imagine the damage that that car could cause. But then if you replace that man with a cop... ...the picture changes. And that's essentially what we've done. Now, how many people have you treated so far? Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials in humans so far. - And how many are cancer-free? - Ten thousand and nine. So you have actually cured cancer? Yes, yes. Yes, we have. What you see? What you see? Damn. Let's go, Sam. Come on. Good morning, Matt. It's looking great, I'll tell you. Not only was this the biggest snowstorm in New York City history... ... it had to be one of the prettiest. Imagine waking up on Sunday... ... to 26.9 inches of snow in New York City. Here you go. Just the way you like it. Disgusting. Excuse me, excuse me. All right. Come on, relax. However, it did strand planes, trains and automobiles. There was a report, a Turkish Airlines flight skidded off the runway at JFK. No one was injured, but for the most part, Matt... There you go. I'm gonna show you, attempting the Bob Hager rule of thumb here. And I'm gonna plug my ruler in. In New York, in 30 Rock, we have 16 inches of snow, Matt. Back to you, Matt and Katie. Gosh. All right, it looks great. It'll be beautiful for the next day, at least. - And then it turns brown. If that. Anyway, Ann, thanks so much. Mm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables. Don't just push them around, eat them. I'm not playing. Good morning. This morning, all up the East Coast... Okay. You gonna eat your vegetables. We will sit down here all night. The biggest challenge is getting back to work. What are you whining about? Why didn't you just eat your vegetables? Hey. All right, here's the deal. Look. Look. You're gonna eat twice as many vegetables tomorrow night. All right? Deal? Deal? Come on. Don't worry About a thing 'Cause every little thing Gonna be all right I know that feels good. Smiled with the rising sun Three little birds Ah, Sam. Singin' sweet songs Of melody... I'm all right. I'm all right, it's all right. What's happening? I tried to reach you on your cell. I get a recording. - Cell service is down. - Where are we going? - Can't get used to the new regs. Going to Aunt Sara's. - Ma! No! Why? - Baby, just strap yourself in. Go. We're at 30 minutes, colonel. - Copy. - Thirty minutes to what? - They're sealing off the island. - Seal off the island? This island? - But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sara's. Did you bring all the money? Yeah. How much? Six hundred. Why did you say, ""You're going""? That's not enough. - Robert. You said, ""You're going,"" not, ""We're going."" When you get across, I need you to get to the ATM. Get as much cash as you can. Take Sara's car, go upstate. I'll meet you at the farm. Bring enough food for two weeks. Jesus, Robert, did it jump? Is it airborne? But we only go to Aunt Sara's in the summer. - It may be. - Oh, my God. - It's Christmas. What about my presents? - He's announcing it. Make no mistake, Americans, this virus... You left my Christmas presents in the closet. Hush now, Mar. - threatens the survival of not only our nation, but of every other nation... - Mommy, look, it's a butterfly. - Marley, enough! And so it is with great sadness, but even greater resolve... ... that tonight I have signed an executive order... ... initiating a military quarantine of New York City. God be with us. This has been a special... The window is still open. We find something in a week or two weeks... ...we can reverse the spread. I can still fix this. Please. You can do the same work outside the city. This is ground zero. This is my site. We talked about this. What are you doing? What am I doing? I'm not gonna let this happen. Let? This isn't up to you. You can't control... Ah! Daddy, it's a monster! How'd you sleep? Look out. Come on, you know better than that. Uh-uh. I'll be back. Dr. Robert Neville, September 5th, 2012, GA series, serum 391. Animal trials. Streaming video. GA series results appear typical. Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10... ...11, 14, 16, 18 did not kill the virus. Compounds 2, 5, 7... ...all killed the host. Hold on a second. Compound 6 appears to be showing decreased aggression response. Partial pigmentation return. Slight pupil constriction. GA series, serum 391, Compound 6... ...next candidate for human trials. You hang in there, number six. Yeah, that's what you want. Hey! Good morning, Marge. Good morning, Fred. What are you guys doing here so early? That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred. Don't set it down anywhere. I'll see you guys inside. What's happening, buddy? Yes. Good morning, Hank. I'm midway through the G's. Hey, who's the girl in...? Never mind. Hey, I'll see you in the morning. What am I supposed to say? ""Hello. Wanna see some infected rats?"" Okay, tomorrow. I'm gonna say hello tomorrow. Psst. Come here. Hey. Hey. Good job. You did so good. Yes. Yes. Ah. Look at that. See that? Red salmon. Wow, actual Spam. Yeah. You'll get some of that later. Let's go. Wait. My name is Robert Neville. I am a survivor living in New York City. I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies. I will be at the South Street Seaport every day at midday... ... when the sun is highest in the sky. If you are out there... If anyone is out there... I can provide food. I can provide shelter. I can provide security. If there's anybody out there... ... anybody... Please. You are not alone. Fore! Yeah. Keep your eye on this one for me. Ooh. I'm getting good. Ss-ss. Sam! No, no, no! No! No! Sam! No! No! Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? Hello, Sam? Sam? Sam? Come on. Sam. I gotta go, Sam. I gotta go. I gotta go. Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go. Sam. What are you doing? Sam, we gotta go! Sam, go! Go! Sam, get out! Get out! You gotta pay attention, okay? You gotta pay attention. Listen, uh... ...I want you to stay here on this one, okay? Because you can still get infected. And I can't. So, look, if I'm not back by dark... ...just go. Okay. Subject is female. Likely 18 to 20 years of age. Dilaudid push only sedates effectively at six times human dose. Core temperature, 106 Fahrenheit. Pulse, 200 bpm. Respiration elevated. PA 02, 300 percent of normal. Pupils fully dilated. Nonreactive to light. Extreme reaction to UV exposure. Symptoms and tissue samples confirm subject is infected with KV. Vaccine test. GA series, serum 391, Compound 6. Commencing human trials. Respiration slowing. Pulse, 190. Core temperature... ...104 and decreasing. We may have something here. GA series, serum 391, Compound 6 ineffective on humans. Test results linked to this entry saved on six redundant drives. Still no cure. Day 1001. We came in close contact with a hive today. Blood tests confirm that I remain immune to both the airborne... ...and contact strains. Canines remain immune to airborne strain only. You can't go running into the dark, dummy. Vaccine trials continue. I'm still unable to transfer my immunity to infected hosts. The Krippin Virus is... ...elegant. Just fishing in the dark, son. Mm. A behavioral note, um: An infected male exposed himself to sunlight today. Now, it's possible decreased brain function... ...or the growing scarcity of food is causing them to... ...ignore their basic survival instincts. Social de-evolution appears complete. Typical human behavior is now entirely absent. Why are we stopping? The street's closed, folks. We hoof it. - We got less than 10 minutes. - Baby, give me the dog. - Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go. Daddy! It's all right. It's all right. Come on. Keep the colonel and his family between us and don't let anyone stop you. Mommy, they have guns! It's okay. They're in the Army like Daddy. Unless you have clearance... ... you cannot pass the checkpoint. Please return to your homes. Make a hole, make a hole! Coming through! Coming through! Unless you have clearance, you cannot pass the checkpoint. Please return to your homes. You're clear. Move ahead. You're clear. All right, that's it, move up. All right, step up. You're clear. Next. Let's go. No good. Military quarantine is about to begin. Come on, step back. - Military quarantine is about to begin. - Look, look, look. I'm not infected. Clear. Good, go on. I'm not infected. Please! Please! - Please take my baby. Take my baby, please. You're gonna have to move back. - No good. Follow me, ma'am. What? No! Robert! Robert! Get your hands off my wife. Get your hands off. - Mommy! Stand down. Lieutenant... - Mommy! - Scan her again. Get your hands off of her! Get your hands off of my wife. Stand down! - Scan her again. Stand down! Stand down, soldier! Stand down! I am Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville. I am ordering you to scan her again. Scan her again! All right, scan her again. - It's clear. - It's clear. Move through. Who's next? Come on. Take my baby with you! Please! Please! - Mommy! - Please take my baby. Please! Daddy, why can't the little girl come too? Stay away from the shoreline. How long? Five minutes. We'll make it. This is Ranger 621, we're on site. Military quarantine is about to begin. I won't take my eyes off them, colonel. You got my word on it. Give me a kiss. I love you. I love you. Dear Lord, please watch over Robert... ...and keep him strong through the struggles ahead. Lord, please just bring him home safely. Amen. Daddy's gonna make the monsters go away, baby, okay? Sam, you protect Daddy. - No, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog. Sir, we gotta go! Daddy, look, it's a butterfly. It's a butterfly. All right, come on, let's go! How'd you sleep? Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look at the ongoing mutations... ... of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed miracle cure for cancer. So far, almost 5000 patients treated with her retrofitted virus... ... have begun exhibiting symptoms resembling the early onset of rabies. Twenty-five patients have already died. Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals to stockpile antiviral drugs... ... and to begin preliminary quarantine protocols. It's my birthday. We are fully confident Dr. Neville can see us through these... You gonna sing? My name is Robert Neville. I am a survivor living in New York City. I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies. I will be at the South Street Seaport every day at midday... ... when the sun is highest in the sky. If you are out there, if anyone is out there... I can provide food. I can provide shelter. I can provide security. If there's anybody out there, anybody... Please. You are not alone. Listen, uh... ...if you're planning a party or something, just tell me now. Okay? Because you know I don't like surprises. And I swear I'll act surprised. Okay? Hey! Hey! What the hell are you doing out here, Fred?! What the...? What the hell are you...? No! No! No! No. What the hell are you doing out here, Fred?! How did you get out here?! Fred, if you're real, you better tell me right now! If you're real, you better tell me right now! Damn it, Fred! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm all right, I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. Baby. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Let's go. Eh, eh! Come on. Sam, come on. Let's go! Sam! No! No! Let's go! We gotta go home, Sam. Let's go! Sam! No! Sam? Sam? It's okay. You're all right. Okay. It's okay. You're all right. You're all right. Samantha? Samantha, look at me, girl. Hey. You're okay. You're okay. Samantha. We just gotta get you home. Gotta get you... Gotta take you home. Let me take you home. All right, come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come on. Come here. Come here. I got you. I got you. It's okay. You're okay. Don't worry About a thing 'Cause every little thing Is gonna be all right Don't worry About a thing Rise up this morning Smiled with the rising sun Three little birds I promised my friend... ...that I would say hello to you today. Hello. Hello. Please say hello to me. Please say hello to me. Die! Die! Die! Come on! Stay with me! Where do you live? Hey. Hey! Stay with me. Where do you live? Where do you live? Uh... 11 Washington Square. They don't know where I live. Don't... Don't let them track us. You gotta stay out till dawn. No! Donkey? What are you doing? I would think of all people you would recognize a wall when you see one. Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it. It is. Around your half, see? That's your half, this is my half. Oh, your half? Hm. Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head. Back off! No, you back off. This is my swamp! Our swamp. - Smelly ogre. Fine! Come back, I'm not through with you! Well, I'm through with you. You know, with you it's always ""me, me, me."" Well, guess what, now it's my turn. So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me! You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do. You're always pushing me around or pushing me away. Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back? Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other! Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... ... for stabbing me in the back! You're so wrapped up in layers, you're afraid of your own feelings. Go away. See? Doing it again, just like you did to Fiona... ... and all she did was like you, maybe love you. Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of you talking. She wasn't talking about you, she was talking about somebody else. I'm afraid the eggs are powdered. Obviously you know that. They're yours. But I did find bacon, which is about the most fantastic thing in history. And some antibiotics in the bathroom. I put by your plate, because your leg is okay... ...but it won't be for very long if you don't start a course soon. Who are you? I'm Anna and that's Ethan. Don't let it get cold. It's okay. Go on. We came from Maryland. We heard your message on the radio. We were at the pier at noon. We waited all day. We're going to Vermont. To the survivors' colony. What? In Bethel. It's a safe zone. There's no survivors' colony, there's no safe zones. Nothing happened the way it was supposed to. Nothing worked the way it was supposed to. In the mountains. There's a whole colony of people there who didn't get sick. The virus couldn't survive the cold. There's a colony... Shut up! Shut up! Everybody's dead. Everybody is dead. I just need... I need a minute. Okay? Just... I just... I was saving that bacon. I was saving it. I'm just... I'm gonna go upstairs. All right? Just... I'm gonna go. Ethan, put the knife down. You there! Ogre. Aye. By the order of Lord Farquaad... ... I am authorized to place you both under arrest... ... and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. Oh, really? You and what army? Can I say something to you? You was really, really something back there. Incredible. Are you talking to... ...me? Yes, I was talking to you. You was really great back there. Those guards, they thought they was all that. You showed up, and bam! Tripping over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. That's great. Really. Man, it's good to be free. Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hm? But, uh... ...I don't have any friends. And I'm not going out there by myself. Wait a minute. I got a great idea. I'll stick with you! You a mean, green fighting machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us. I like Shrek. That was really scary. If you don't mind me saying... ... if that don't work, your breath will get the job done... ... because you definitely need some tic tacs, because your breath stinks! Man, you almost burned the hair out of my nose. Just like the time... You're not so good with people anymore, are you? Thank you for my leg. Okay. Where have you been? I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship out of Sao Paulo. Those boats weren't meant to be permanent. No, they weren't. When the Navy fell apart, we started docking to take on supplies. Someone picked it up on shore. Five of us were immune. You said five? The Darkseekers got them. You are the Robert Neville, aren't you? It's too late today. If we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can make it to Vermont in a straight shot. - So if you had... - I'm not leaving. This is ground zero. This is my site. I'm not gonna let this happen. I can still fix this. Whoa. You scared me. - Sorry. I called down twice. Oh. Oh, thank you. It's heavily sedated. Don't worry, it's safe. I've never seen one so still. They're always biting. You think that can cure her? Um... No, this will almost certainly kill it... ...but it's possible by drastically reducing the body temperature... ...I can increase the compound's effectiveness. Did all of them die? Yes. My God. God didn't do this, Anna, we did. Where can Ethan sleep? He's heavy. Can you get that? She's beautiful. What's her name? Marley. - Her name was Marley. - It's a beautiful name. Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley. - Who? - Uh, the singer. Damian? Uh, his father. His father. Nope. I shot the sheriff But I didn't shoot the deputy - Oh, that is unacceptable. - What? Best album ever made. - You don't recognize that? - Mm-mm. Wow. He had this idea, it was kind of a virologist's idea. He believed that you could cure racism and hate. Literally cure it... ...by injecting music and love into people's lives. One day, he was scheduled to perform at a peace rally. Gunmen came to his house and shot him down. Two days later... ...he walked out on that stage and sang. Somebody asked him why. He said, ""The people... ...who are trying to make this world worse are not taking a day off. How can I?"" Light up the darkness. Come with us, Neville. To the colony. There's no colony, Anna. Everything just fell apart. - There was no evacuation plan... - You're wrong. There is a colony. I know, okay? How do you know, Anna? I just know. How? I said, how do you know? How could you know? God told me. He has a plan. - God told you? - Yes. - The God? - Yes. - I know how this sounds. - It sounds crazy. But something told me to turn on the radio. Something told me to come here. My voice on the radio told you to come here, Anna. You were trying to kill yourself last night? Anna. I got here just in time to save your life. That's a coincidence? - Just stop it. Stop it. Stop. - He must have sent me here for a reason. Neville, the world is quieter now. You just have to listen. If we listen... ...we can hear God's plan. - God's plan? - Yeah. All right. Let me tell you about your God's plan. There were 6 billion people on Earth when the infection hit. KV had a 90 percent kill rate. That's 5.4 billion... ...people dead. Crashed and bled out, dead. Less than 1 percent immunity. That left 12 million healthy people like you, me and Ethan. The other 588 million... ...turned into your Darkseekers. And then they got hungry. And they killed and fed on everybody. Everybody! Every single person that you or I has ever known... ...is dead! Dead! There is no God. There is no God. What is that? Was it still dark when you brought us home last night? You were bleeding. There was light on the horizon. Turn the light off. Turn it off. They followed us home. Ethan. Shit. Anna. Anna. Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna? Anna. Come on. Come on. - Are you okay? You all right? Yeah. Are you all right? - You okay? - Oh, my God. You're bleeding. Go to the lab. Downstairs, go! Get to the lab! To the lab! Get behind the Plexi. Oh, my God. Come on. Come on, it's okay. It's okay. Oh, my God. It's working. Neville... ...it's working. No! Stop! Stop! Look, look, look, I can save you. I can sa... I can help you. You are sick and I can help you. I can... I can fix this! I can save everybody! I can fix everything! It's working. It's working! Stop! Stop! Let me save you! Let me save you! No, no! No, no! Daddy, look, it's a butterfly. Robert. - What are you doing? - The cure is in her blood. Coal chute. I think it'll be safe. Ethan, get in! - Go. - Come on, get in. - Get in. - Anna. I think this is why you're here. What are you doing? I'm listening. - Neville, there's room. Come! - No. They're not gonna stop. They're not gonna stop. Stay in till dawn. In 2009, a deadly virus burned through our civilization... ... pushing humankind to the edge of extinction. Dr. Robert Neville dedicated his life... ... to the discovery of a cure... ... and the restoration of humanity. On September 9th, 2012... ... at approximately 8:49 P.M... ... he discovered that cure. And at 8:52, he gave his life to defend it. We are his legacy. This is his legend. Light up the darkness. Subtitles extracted by LeapinLar, Why not call it the Big Chill or the Nippy era? I'm just sayin', how do we know it's an Ice age? Because of all the ice. Well, things just got a little chillier. Help. Help. Come on, kids, let's go. The traffic's movin'. But, but, but, Dad. No buts. You can play extinction later. OK. Come on, guys. So, where's Eddie? He said he was on the verge of an evolutionary breakthrough. Really? I'm flying. Some breakthrough. - Look out. - You're going the wrong way. Crazy mammoth. Do the world a favour. Move your issues off the road. If my trunk was that small, I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal. Give me a break. We've been waddlin' all day. Go ahead. Follow the crowd. It'll be quieter when you're gone. Come on. If he wants to freeze to death, let him. I'm up. I'm up. Rise and shine, everybody. Huh? Zak? Marshall? Bertie? Uncle Fungus? Where is everybody? Come on, guys, we're gonna miss the migration. They left without me. They do this every year. Why? Doesn't anyone love me? Isn't there anyone who cares about Sid the Sloth? All right, I'll just go by myself. Sick. Wide body, kerb it next time. Oh, jeez. Yuck. I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens. Frank, where did you ever...? - Go ahead. Dig in. - A dandelion. - I thought the frost wiped 'em all out. - All but one. It makes me so... I wanna... Yuck. This has definitely not been my day. You know what I'm sayin', buddy? What a mess. You rhinos have tiny brains. Did you know that? It's just a fact. No offence. You probably didn't even know what I'm talkin' about. Yummo. A dandelion. Must be the last one of the season. - Carl. - Easy, Frank. He ruined our salad. My mistake. That was my mistake. Let me... No, no, seriously, let me take care of this. What is this? Pine cones. Oh, my goodness. They're my favourite. Delicious. That's good eating. But don't let me hog them all up. Here, you have some. Tasty, isn't it? Bon apptit. Now? Now. - Just pretend that I'm not here. - I wanted to hit him at full speed. - That's OK. We'll have some fun with him. - Don't let them impale me. I wanna live. - Get off me. - Come on, you're makin' a scene. We'll just take our furry piata and go. If it's not them today, it's someone else tomorrow. Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK? We'll break your neck so you don't feel a thing. Wait a minute. I thought rhinos were vegetarians. - An excellent point. - Shut up. Who says we're gonna eat him after we kill him? I don't like animals that kill for pleasure. - Save it for a mammal that cares. - I'm a mammal that cares. OK, if either of you make it across that sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth. That's right, you losers. You take one step and you're dead. - You were bluffing, huh? - Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff. Get him. A dandelion? We did it. - You have beautiful eyes. - Get off my face. Whoa, we make a great team. What do you say we head south together? Great. Jump on my back and relax the whole way. - Wow, really? - No. Wait, aren't you going south? The change of seasons, migration instincts. - Any of this a-ringin' a bell? - I guess not. Bye. OK, then. Thanks for the help. I can take it from here. You overgrown weasel. Wait till we get down there. That south thing is way overrated. The heat, the crowds - who needs it? Isn't this great? You and me, two bachelors knockin' about in the wild. No, you just want a bodyguard so you don't become somebody's side dish. You're a very shrewd mammal. OK, lead the way, Mr Big... Didn't get the name. - Manfred. - Manfred? Yuck. How about Manny the Moody Mammoth? Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the... Stop following me. OK, so you've got issues. You won't even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip. Look at the cute little baby, Diego. - Isn't it nice he'll be joining us for breakfast? - It wouldn't be breakfast without him. Especially since his daddy wiped out half our pack and wears our skin to keep warm. An eye for an eye, don't you think? Let's show him what happens when he messes with sabres. Alert the troops. We attack at dawn. And, Diego, bring me that baby alive. If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge, I want it to be fresh. Phew. I'm wiped out. - That's your shelter? - You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood. - I'm a little guy. - You got half a stick. But with my little stick and my highly evolved brain, I shall create fire. Fascinating. We'll see if brains triumph over brawn tonight. Now, won't we? Think I saw a spark. Any chance I could squeeze in there with you, Manny, ol' pal? Isn't there someone else you can annoy? Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles? My family abandoned me. They just kinda migrated without me. You should see what they did last year. They woke up early and tied my hands and feet and they gagged me with a field mouse, covered their tracks, went through water so I'd lose their scent, and... who needs 'em, anyway? So what about you? You have family? OK, you're tired. I see. We'll talk more in the morning. Manfred? Manfred? Could you scooch over a drop? Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast. Manny. There's Diego. Fall back. - Where's the baby? - I lost it over the falls. You lost it? - I want that baby, Diego. - I'll get it. You'd better, unless you want to serve as a replacement. We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there. It had better be alive. Can we trust you with that, Diego? Let's go. She picked a hair off my shoulder and says, ""If you have an extra mating dance, at least pick a female with the same colour pelt. "" I thought ""Whoa. She's gonna go praying mantis on me. "" If you find a mate, you should be loyal. In your case, grateful. - Now get away from me. - I think mating for life is stupid. There's plenty of Sid to go around. Manny? Manny? Look at that. He's OK. She's gone. - Manny, are you forgetting something? - No. - But you just saved him. - I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved. But you can't leave him here. Look, there's smoke. That's his herd right up the hill. - We should return him. - Let's get this straight. There is no ""we"". There never was a ""we"". In fact, without me, there wouldn't even be a ""you"". - Just up the hill. - Listen very carefully: I'm not going. - Fine, be a jerk. I'll take care of him. - Yeah, that's good. You can't even take care of yourself. This, I gotta see. I'll return you. We don't need that meany-weeny mammoth, do we? No, we don't. You're an embarrassment to nature. Do you know that? This is cake. I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm gonna die. Manny. - That pink thing is mine. - No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us. ""Us""? You two are a bit of an odd couple. There is no ""us"". I see. Can't have one of your own, so you want to adopt. Look, I'm sorry to interrupt your snack, but we gotta go. The baby? Please. I was returning him to his herd. Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth. - Callin' me a liar? - I didn't say that. You were thinkin' it. I don't like this cat. He reads minds. - Name's Diego, friend. - Manfred, and I'm not your friend. Fine, Manfred. If you're lookin' for the humans, you're wastin' your time. They left. Thanks for the advice. Now beat it. I'll help you bring it to its herd, but leave me alone after that. - OK. OK, deal. What's your problem? - You are my problem. I think you're stressed, so you eat too much. It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet. I'm not fat. It's all this fur. It makes me look poofy. All right, you have fat hair. But when you're ready to talk, I'm here. What are you doin'? Just drop it on the ledge. - We should make sure they found him. - Good idea. No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't spear me. - This is a problem. - Now what? That's perfect. - I told you they were gone. - Look who it is. Don't you have some poor animal to disembowel? They couldn't be far. I mean, they went this way, or this way? You don't know much about tracking, do you? I'm a sloth. I see a tree, eat a leaf. That's my tracking. You didn't miss them by much. It's still green. They headed north two hours ago. It's still green. They headed north two hours ago. You don't need this aggravation. Give me the baby. I can track humans down a lot faster than you. And you're just a good citizen helpin' out? - I just know where the humans are going. - Glacier Pass. Everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side. Unless you know how to track, you'll never reach them before snow closes the pass. Which should be, like, tomorrow. So, you can give that baby to me, or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice. Here's your little bundle of joy. We're returning it to the humans. The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind. Poor tigey-wigey. Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way. Manny, can I talk to you for a second? No. The sooner we find the humans, the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face, and the baby, too. You won't always have Jumbo around to protect you. And when that day comes, I suggest you watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it. ber-tracker. Up front, where I can see you. Help me. You gotta make it stop. I can't take it any more. - I've eaten things that complained less. - He won't stop squirming. - Watch its head. - Put it down. Jeez, ""pick him up, put him down... "" - Its nose is dry. - That means something's wrong with it. - Someone should lick it. Just in case. - I'll do it. - He's wearing one of those baby thingies. - So? So if he poops, where does it go? - Humans are disgusting. - OK, you. Check for poop. - Why am I the poop-checker? - Returning him was your idea, you're small and insignificant, and I'll pummel you if you don't. - Why else? - Now, Sid. I mean, my goodness. Look out. Coming through. - Watch out. - Stop wavin' that thing around. I'm gonna slip. It's clean. Got ya! Will you cut it out? Do that again. He likes it. It's makin' me feel better too. Here, you hold it. Turn him towards me. Where is the baby? There he is. Where is the baby? There he is. Stop it. You're scarin' him. - I bet he's hungry. - How about some milk? - I'd love some. - Not you. The baby. I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal. - You're a little low on the food chain to... - Enough. Enough, enough, enough. Food. I don't know, but I've been told I don't know, but I've been told End of the world be mighty cold Prepare for the Ice age! Protect the dodo way of life! Survival separates the dodos from the beasts! Protect the dodo way of life! Prepare for the Ice age! - Ice age? - I've heard of these crackpots. - Intruders. - Now, don't fall in. - If you do, you will definitely... - Intruders. Intruder... .. burn and die. Can we have our melon back? Junior's hungry and... No way. This is our private stockpile for the Ice age. Sub arctic temperatures will force us underground for a billion years. So you got three melons? If you weren't smart enough to plan ahead, then doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you. - Get away from me. - Doom on you. Oh, no. No. Retrieve the melon. Tae kwon dodos, attack. - The melon. - The melon, the melon, the melon... There goes our last female. - Got it, got it, got it. - Don't got it. The last melon. Sid. Now we gotta find more food. Right, more to the right. Right, right, right. - Look at that. Dinner and a show. - Left, left, left. Now to find a meal befitting a conquering hero. What ho? A foe? Come on, come on. You want a piece of me? Spoils worthy of such a noble... Bedtime, squirt. The triumphant return. Huh? Oh, that. I'm so full. How about a good-night kiss for your big buddy, Sid? - He's asleep. - I was talking to you. Fine, I'll tuck myself in. All right, good night. Will you stop it? All right, all right. I was trying to relax. Oy. - What the...? - Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do. - I'm workin' here, you waste of fur. - Frustrated, Diego? Tracking down helpless infants too difficult for you? - What are you two doin' here? - Soto's getting tired of waiting. Yeah, he said ""Come back with the baby, or don't come back at all. "" I have a message for Soto. Tell him I'm bringing the baby. And tell him I'm bringing... a mammoth. - A mammoth? - Mammoths never travel alone. This one does, and I'm leading him to Half Peak. Look at all that meat. Let's get him. Not yet. We'll need the whole pack to bring this mammoth down. Get everyone ready. Now. - Where's the baby? - You lost it? Sid. It's so ugly. Positively adorable. Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean. - Where'd you find it? - The poor kid, all alone in the wild. Sabres were closing in on him. - So I just snatched him. - So brave. Yeah, well, he needed me, and I only wish I had one of my own, too. Really? I find that attractive in a male. Alas. Who wouldn't want a family, I always say. - Where've you been hiding? - Yeah, well, you know... Cute kid, huh? So, as I was saying, ladies... Hey. Hi, Manny. What's the matter with you? Excuse me, ladies. You just keep marinating and I'll be right back. Sexy. He's not much to look at, but it's so hard to find a family guy. Tell me about it. All the sensitive ones get eaten. No, no, no. Manny, please, I'm begging you. I need him. - A good-lookin' guy like you? - You say that, but you don't mean it. No, seriously. Look at you. Those ladies, they don't stand a chance. - You have a cruel sense of humour. - Don't let me cramp your style. - Thanks, Manny. You're a pal. - Without Pinky. Manny, I need him. So, ladies, where were we? - Carl. - Easy, Frank. Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves like a cheetah. And that tiger... Yeah, Mr Great Tracker. Can't even find a sloth. What am I? The wet nurse? What are you lookin' at, bone bag? Look at you. You're gonna grow into a great predator. I don't think so. What have you got? You got a little patch of fur. No fangs, no claws. You're folds of skin wrapped in mush. What's so threatening about you? Does this look like a petting zoo to you? Huh? OK. All right, wise guy. You just earned a time-out. You think that's funny? How about this? You'll be a little snack for the owls. You're a brave little squirt, I'll give you that. Thank goodness. Thank goodness. No. A tiger. Help. Help. - Where's the baby? - Manfred has him. Just put me in your mouth. Come on. Hurry up. He got me. Help. - Get away from me. - It went this way. Over here. Carl. The tiger beat us to him. Wait a minute. He's dead all right. Carnivores have all the fun. Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts like that. But you know how it is. All right, thanks. You can put me down now. Manny. Manny. Guys, I thought we were in a hurry. And Diego, spit that out. You don't know where it's been. Boy. For a second there, I thought you were gonna eat me. - I don't eat junk food. - Thought you were gonna... I thought you were gonna... Were you? Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on, come on. Can you wait a second, please? Fellas. Thanks for waiting. Three, two, one... Sure is faithful. - Don't make me reach back. - He started it. I don't care who started it. I'll finish it. Modern architecture. It'll never last. Hiya, Manny. Hi, Diego. Hey, Sid. - You're lost. - No. I know exactly where we are. Ask him directions. - I don't need directions. - Fine, I'll ask him. Buddy. You see any humans go by here? I love this game. I love this game. OK, OK. Three words. First word. Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp. Let me try. Pack. Good one, Manny. Pack of long teeth and claws. Pack of wolves? Pack of... Pack of bears? Pack of fleas? Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses? - Pachyderm? - Pack of lies. Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop. Pack of birds. Pack of flying fish. Great news. I found a short cut. - What do you mean, short cut? - I mean faster than the long way around. I know what a short cut is. Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass or we take the long way and miss 'em. Through there? What do you take me for? This time tomorrow, you could be a free mammoth. Or a nanny. I never get tired of peek-a-boo. Guys. Guys. Check this out. Sid, the tiger found a short cut. No, thanks. I choose life. Then I suggest you take the short cut. - Are you threatening me? - Move, sloth! Way to go, tiger. Quick. Get inside. OK, I vote short cut. Guys, stick together. It's easy to get lost in here. Guys? A fish. Will you keep up, please? Hard enough to keep track of one baby. I gotcha. Captain, iceberg ahead. Oh, no. Yeah. Who's up for round two? Tell the kid to be more careful. Look, look. Tigers. No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers are just playing tag with the antelope. - With their teeth. - Come on, Sid, let's play tag. You're it. Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloths? You never see any sloths. Have you ever noticed? - Look, Manny, a mammoth. - Somebody pinch me. Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you. And he's got a family. And he's happy. Look, he's playing with his kid. See? That's your problem. That's what mammoths are supposed to do. - Sid... - Find a she-mammoth, have baby mammoths... - Sid. - What? - Shut up. - But... Would you look at that. The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak. Next stop, Glacier Pass. - How could I ever have doubted you? - Did you hear that, little fella? You're almost home. - My feet are sweating. - Do we need a newsflash - every time your body does something? - Ignore him. Seriously. My feet are really hot. Tell me that was your stomach. I'm sure it was just thunder. From underground? Come on, keep up with me. I would if you were moving. - I wish I could jump like that. - Wish granted. - Come on, move faster. - Have you noticed the river of lava? Hold Pinky. Manny. Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK? Come on, come on, say something. Anything. What? What? I can't hear you. You're standing on my trunk. - You're OK. You're OK. - Why did you do that? You could have died, trying to save me. That's what you do in a herd. You look out for each other. Well, thanks. I don't know about you guys, but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen. I can't wait to get my claws in that mammoth. No one touches the mammoth until I get that baby. First, I'll slice its hind quarters into sections. - I'll put the white meat in one pile and... - Knock it off. I'm starving. Next, the shoulders. Occasionally tough, but extremely juicy. - I told you to knock it off. - Save your energy. Mammoths don't go down easy. There's only one way to do it. First, you have to force it into a corner. Cut off its retreat. And when you three have it trapped, I'll go for the throat. Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind. - How much further? - Three miles. I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning. - What are you doin'? - I'm putting sloths on the map. Why don't you make it realistic and draw him lying down? And make him rounder. - Perfect. - I forgot how to laugh. I'm a genius. From now on you'll have to refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame. Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire. Thank you. From now on, I'm gonna call you Diego. Lord of Touch Me and You're Dead. I'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead. Lovebirds. Look at this. I don't believe it. Come here, you little biped. Come here, you little wormy-worm. Come to Uncle Sid. No, no, no, no, no, no. This way. This way. No, no, no. No, go to him. Go to him. OK. Good job. Keep practisin'. Look at that. Our little guy is growing up. All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy. Look at that big pushover. You know, Diego, I've never had a friend who would risk his life for me. Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy. Yeah, he is. Well, good night. Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky? Let me just clean that up. That looks good. A little bit here. - You clean up nice, little fella. - I think he's starting to look like me. Diego, what do you think? - Maybe we shouldn't do this. - Why not? If we save him, he'll be a hunter. And who do you think he'll hunt? Maybe because we save him, he won't hunt us. Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and a long skinny neck and call you Mama. - What's your problem? - Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off. Diego. You frozen back there? - Get down. - What? - Get down and follow me. - What's goin' on? At the bottom of Half Peak, there's an ambush waiting for you. - What? - What do you mean, ""ambush""? - You set us up. - It was my job. - I was to get the baby, but then... - You brought us home for dinner. - That's it. You're out of the herd. - I'm sorry. No, you're not. Not yet. - Listen, I can help you. - Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out. You can't. The pack's too strong. You have to trust me. Trust you? Why in the world would we trust you? Because I'm your only chance. Hello, ladies. - Look who decided to show up. - Diego, I was beginning to worry about you. No need to worry. In about two minutes you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge. Very nice. I see the sloth. And he's got the baby. Don't give away your positions until you see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise. You want to maul something, don't you? - I wanna maul. - Then what are you waiting for? No, I said wait for the mammoth. Backscratcher. Eat my powder! Loop-de-loop. Slalom! Slalom, baby! Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite. Get him. Surprise! OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid and get outta here while we can. Come on, Diego, let's bring this mammoth down. There he is. That's right. Where's the baby? Survival of the fittest. I don't think so. Yeah. - What are you doing? - Leave the mammoth alone. Fine. I'll take you down first. We did it. We were some team, huh? Were? Come on, we're still a team. I'm sorry I set you up. You know me - I'm too lazy to hold a grudge. Knock it off, squirt. You gotta be strong. You have to take care of Manfred and Sid. Especially Sid. Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger. Look, I'll carry you. Come on, what do you say? Come on, Diego, come on. Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny. Listen, you have to leave me here. If those humans get through the pass, you'll never catch them. You didn't have to do that. That's what you do in a herd. Don't forget about us. OK? We won't forget about you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Sid... - Bye. Bye. That's right. Where's the baby? Come on, Sid, let's head south. Bye. Save your breath, Sid. You know humans can't talk. Diego? You're OK. - Nine lives, baby. - You're OK. You're OK. I could kiss ya. Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift? No thanks. I gotta save whatever dignity I've got left. You're hanging out with us. Dignity's got nothing to do with it. I'll take that lift. - Yeah, climb aboard. - Pick me up, buddy. Mush. Or not mush. Either way. This is gonna be the best migration ever. I'll show you my favourite watering holes. I turn brown when the fungus in my fur dries. - Attractive. - This whole Ice age thing is getting old. You know what I could go for? Global warming. - Keep dreamin'. - No, really... Edited by BugZ www.DarksideRG.com, Mrs. Peterson! Ramon, hey! How's it goin'? How you doin'? There it is, right there on the desk. - Where's she headed? - She's snowbound, Ramon. - See you went with the pink. - Yeah, yeah. It's kind of a pink day today. I'm gonna have another pickup for you on Thursday. - All right. We'll see you then. - All right. Thanks, Ramon. Peterson! Peterson! Peterson. - Mr. Cowboy, da? - Da. Mmm, it's pretty. Mmm. It's from my wife. Time... rules over us without mercy... not caring if we're healthy or ill, hungry or drunk... Russian, American, beings from Mars. It's like a fire. It could either destroy us or keep us warm. That's why every FedEx office has a clock. Because we live or we die by the clock. We never turn our back on it. And we never, ever allow ourselves... the sin of losing track of time! Locally, it's 1:56. That means we've got three hours and four minutes... before the end-of-the-day's package sort. That's how long we have. That's how much time we have... before this pulsating, accursed, relentless taskmaster... tries to put us out of business. Hey, Nicolai. Hey. Nicolai, good to see you. How are you, kid? Look what you did. You just delivered your very first FedEx package. That deserves something special, like a Snickers bar... and a C.D. player. And something to listen to... a C.D. There. Elvis Presley. Fifty million fans can't be wrong. You all recognize this, don't you? I took the liberty of sending this to myself. I FedEx'd it before I left Memphis. You're probably wondering what could be in here. What could it possibly be? Is it architectural plans? Maybe technical drawings? Is this the new wallpaper for the... for the bathroom? It is... a clock... which I started at absolute zero... and is now at 87 hours, 22 minutes and 17 seconds. From Memphis, America to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours. Eighty-seven hours is a shameful outrage. This is just an egg timer! What if it had been something else? Like your paycheck? Or fresh boysenberries? Or adoption papers? Eighty-seven hours is an eternity. The cosmos was created in less time! Wars have been fought and nations toppled in 87 hours! Fortunes made and squandered. What? What are you saying about me? I tell them, what do they expect? This man, when his truck broke down, he stole a boy's bicycle to do his delivery. I borrowed it! I borrowed a kid's bike. And I got my packages delivered, and that is what you people are gonna have to start doing. You have to start doing whatever it takes, because in three hours and two minutes... every one of these packages has to be on the big truck... and on its way to the airport. Fifteen minutes! - Crunch time! Crunch time! - Crunch time! Let's go! Every package on the airport truck. Go! Crunch, crunch, crunch! - We have a big problem. - What? - The truck in Red Square is stuck. - What do you mean? - It's stuck. - Stuck how? In snow? In ice? It's stuck! The most important truck... the Kremlin truck! Many packages. All right, all right, all right. Let's put the table right here. We'll just do the sort. Ah, yeah, a clamp. That would make us stuck. Let's go. Unload... Get him out of there. Right here. Two lines, two lines. One to the airport truck, one to the Moscow truck. Got it? C.D.G., F.E., M.E, Memphis on the airport truck. Everything else right there. Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock. Four minutes. - Hi, this is Kelly. - If you're calling for Chuck, press one. Otherwise leave a message after the tone. Thanks. Hello, Kelly. Are you there? Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. You're not there. You're not gonna believe this. I'm doin' the sorts in the middle of Red Square... in the shadow of Lenin's tomb. I'm outta here in two minutes and I'm pickin' up the sweep through Paris... so I should be back in Memphis about 18 hours or so. That's the good news. The bad news is... I gotta go to the dentist this week. I got something in there that's hurtin'. I love you and I'm gonna see you soon, and you know what that means. Bye-bye. Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock! I absolutely, positively have to get to Memphis tonight. Can't help you. Try U.P.S. With this extra head wind, are we gonna be able to push it and make the sort? - We'll do our best. - ""Our best,"" huh? Gwen, is there something wrong with our doctors that Jack keeps getting certified to fly? - Aren't you concerned? - I'm terrified. But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. That's the spirit. Relentless is our goal. Relentless! What do you expect from the guy who stole a crippled kid's bicycle... - when his truck broke down? - I borrowed it. But I love that the kid's now crippled. So you missed the last truck by two minutes? Two minutes. Actually, it was less than that. The plane wasn't that heavy. You could've added some fuel... picked up the speed and made up the time. It's about the trucks. Today's truck was two minutes late. Tomorrow's will be four minutes late, and then six minutes and eight minutes late. - Next thing you know, we're the U.S. Mail. - Yeah, well... All I'm sayin' is, if you'd gotten all those trucks on the plane... those Russkies would be walking on water right now. Hey, don't... Don't gimme that look. - It's just grape juice. Right, Chuck? - Yeah. It's like a 1992 full-bodied grape juice. I see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. We'd offer you some but, you know, somebody's got to fly the plane. Yeah, well, I ""just say no,"" right? Listen, Stan, I've been meaning to ask you. How's Mary? Oh. Uh, well... - we really don't know anything yet. - Mm-hmm. Uh, she went to the doctor yesterday, and, uh... it hasn't meta... metastasized... as far as they can tell right now. It's just kind of wait and see. I'm so sorry. Tell her I'm gonna come by and see her on my next layover. I want you to know, Stan, we are all thinking about her and you. - And just blessings. - Thank you, Gwen. Hi, this is Kelly. If you're calling for Chuck, press one. Otherwise, leave a message after the tone. Thanks. Stan. Listen. Uh, I heard about this... I heard about this doctor down in Emory, in Atlanta. Uh, he's supposed to be the absolute best. He worked on Frank Toretta's wife. Frank Toretta is a systems analyst. He played center field for us. You know him. In the softball tournament last Labor Day. Anyway, beside the point. Uh, what I was thinking is, is that I could get his number... the doctor... and, uh... you know, put you all together and... You know, you could get this thing fixed. You could beat it. Thanks, Chuck. So, I'll get his number. - Is Kelly Frears around? - She's copying her dissertation. - You're home. - Home indeed. I love that you're home. Just days before Santa departs on his annual gift-giving venture... he's been declared physically fit to fly. Santa got checked out by doctors at the V.A. Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. After they declared the jolly old elf in tiptop shape... Santa Claus took off into the wild blue yonder for an early start. In Sarajevo, he spent the day with children... handing out presents and even helping them decorate... the special Christmas tree. Santa and a sea of elves took over the floor... at the Hong Kong Futures Exchange. Market traders bought Santa hats, donating... The turkey's a little dry, isn't it? - No. - The turkey is perfect. - How many did you do last night? - Last night? 2.9 million. Now you've got to be in the market for more of these candied yams. Here you go. 2.9 has got to be the record. Look at those marshmallows. When I was there, we did two million. - We thought that was a big deal. - The glory days. - What'd they do the first night? - The very first night? - Twelve. - Twelve thousand? - Hell, no. Twelve. - That's right. And they did the sort right there on a card table. And Fred Smith had that card table bronzed. I've been hearing that for five years. It's in his office today. They go from that to the new hub up in Anchorage. It's state of the art... a perfect marriage... between technology and systems management. Speaking of marriage, Chuck, when are you gonna make an honest woman out of Kelly? - How long? - Fourteen minutes into the meal. - You won. I owe you $5. - So I win. - Way before the pie. - I told him on the way up. Right about the time the pie came out, the marriage... Kelly is still recovering from her failed relationship with that parolee. He was a lawyer. I knew it had something to do with raising your right hand... and swearing to tell the truth. Remember when he fell on the sidewalk and broke his shoulder at the wedding reception? He tripped on a curb holding a door open for me. - Aunt Kelly was married before? - It's not even worth remembering. So since her failed marriage to the parolee... Oh, my God. Kelly can't see being with a man who wears a pager to bed. What're you gonna attach it to, Hoss? When you wear it to bed, I hope you got one of those things... that go vibratin'. Watch it. I'm not touching that. Oh, did you hit an olive pit? - I thought I took all of them out. - No, no, it's not that. - Okay, I'll cancel Saturday. - No, don't. If I'm not here, I'm not. But if I am, well... - then I am. - It's cancelled. But you gotta be here New Year's Eve. Malaysia can't be that bad. I'll be here New Year's Eve. - When are you defending your dissertation? - January 12. I'm gonna have to switch over the South America thing. If I do that on the third or fourth... I'm gonna have to head back out on the 13th. So long as you're here New Year's Eve. I will be here New Year's Eve. I promise. What? What about our Christmas? I got a gift for you. We have to do it in the car. I'd just like a minute over here, all right? Thanks. Two minutes, okay? Two more minutes. Thanks. Hey! - Merry Christmas. - I thought you were gonna stiff me. No. - What is the ribbon? Is it a thousand-pound... - test fishing line or something? - Here's your fancy thing. Thanks. I love the wrapping. - And I love the box. - Good. Oh. Oh, my. Oh, that is terrific. My grandaddy used it on the Southern Pacific. Hey, I took this. This is my favorite picture of you. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm always gonna keep this... on Memphis time. Kelly time. Hmm. You haven't said anything about your presents. Is there a problem? I'm sorry, no! I love 'em. Look at my journal. Ah! - What about the pager? - Real leather. The pages have gold on 'em. - Did you like the pager or not? - Yes. I love it. Look at him in his little blue Russian house. - It's from Russia. - My God. - It's not one of those loud ones? - No. You can program it so it vibrates... and lights up and see it in the dark. It seems like a real nice pager. Sorry about the hand towels. You're hard to shop for. No, no. I love 'em. Every time I wash my hands, I will think of you. All right, I gotta go. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - I love you. - I love you too. Chuck! Keys! - Thank you. - That reminds me. I almost forgot. I have one more present for you. Only this isn't an ""open in the car"" kind of present... like, say, hand towels. Which were a joke, by the way. I'm terrified. Just take it and hold onto it, and you can open it... on New Year's Eve. And I love you. I'll be right back. Hey, Al, where are we? Somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. Ha, ha, ha!

""Albert R. Miller."" Not Alan. Albert. So, that's it. Hey! A ship! Hey! Hey! A ship! Over here! Hey! Hey! Over here! Over here! Over here! Over here! Over here! Help me! Help! Right here! Right here! Help! Look here! Look, look, look! S... O... S! Please! Help! Come on! Help! ""Happy birthday."" ""The most beautiful thing in the world is, of course, the world itself. Johnny, have the happiest birthday ever. Score. Your Grandpa."" Ew. Come on. Come on. Come on. You wouldn't have a match... by any chance, would you? Oh, oh, oh! The air got to it. The air got to it! Come on, come on. Come on. I did it. I did it. Fire! There you go! Light it up! Come on! Ouch! Here you go! Here you go! It's a signal fire! And it spells out S.O.S! Whoa! It's a meteor shower! Fireflies! Go! Run! You're free! You're free! Ouch! Ouch! Yeah! Yes! Look what I have created! I have made fire! I... have made fire! Mmm! You gotta love crab. In the nick of time too. I couldn't take much more of those coconuts. Coconut milk's a natural laxative. Things that Gilligan never told us. Oh. Pretty well-made fire, huh, Wilson? So... Wilson. We were en route... from Memphis for 11 and a half hours. About 475 miles an hour. So they think that we are right here. But... we went out of radio contact... and flew around that storm for about an hour. So that's a distance of what, 400 miles? Four hundred miles squared. That's 160,000... times pi... 3.14. Five hundred and two thousand, four... That's a search area of 500,000 square miles. That's twice the size of Texas. They may never find us. This tooth is just killing me. It started out just hurting when I bit down... but now it just hurts all the time. All the time. It's-It's a good thing there's not much to eat around here... because I don't think I could chew it. Just keep sucking on all that coconut and all that crab. And just think... I used to avoid going to the dentist... like the plague. I put it off every single chance I got. But now... oh, what I wouldn't give... to have a-a dentist right here in this cave. In fact, I wish you were a dentist. Yeah. Dr. Wilson. You wanna hear something funny? Back home in Memphis... my dentist's name is Dr. James Spaulding. She's much prettier in real life. Shut up! ""Bakersfield""? Bakersfield! This could work. This could work. Twenty-two... Forty-four lashings. Forty-four lashings. So... We have to make rope again. Wilson, we're gonna have to make a hell of a lot of rope. Eight lashings of these structurals. That's 24 apiece. That'll be 100... 160. Here we are today. That gives us another month and a half until we're into March and April... which is our best chances for the high tides and the offshore breezes. We need... We need 424 feet... of good rope, plus another 50 feet, say, for miscellaneous. Round that off to 475 feet of good rope. Now, if we average 15 feet a day... Plus, we have to build it... we have to stock it, we have to launch it. That's gonna be tight. That is not much time. But we... We live and we die by time, don't we? Now, let's not commit the sin of turning our back on time. I know. This is it. That's all that's left. I checked over the whole island, and that is all that's left. So we're gonna be short. Short. We'll just have to make some more out of the videotape. Yes. No, we have time. We do. We have time. Look! The wind's still blowing in from the west. I know! Yeah, I know... I know where there's 30 feet of extra rope! But... But I'm not going back up there. There, there. There, you see? Huh? There. Are you happy? Do you have to keep bringing that up? Can't you just forget it? Huh? You were right. You were right. It was a good thing that we did a test... 'cause it wasn't gonna be just a quick little snap. I would have landed on the rocks. Broken my leg or my back or my neck. Bled to death. But it was the only option I had at the time though, okay? It was what, a year ago? So let's just forget it. And what is your point? Well... we might just make it. Did that thought ever cross your brain? Well, regardless, I would rather take my chance out there on the ocean... than to stay here and die on this shithole island... spending the rest of my life talking to a goddamn volleyball! Shut you up. Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! Wilson. Wilson! Oh, God! Wilson! Wilson! Oh! Oh! Never again. Never again, never again. You're okay. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I know you. I know you. I know you. So, we okay? Okay? Okay. You still awake? Me too. You scared? Me too. Okay. Here we go, Wilson. You don't have to worry about anything. I'll do all the paddling. You just hang on. Not yet! Hold on! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Stand by, Wilson! Hold on! Hold on, Wilson! I think we did it! I think we did it! Wilson! I think we did it! Oh! They're gone! I don't know why! Where's Wilson? Where's Wilson? Wilson, where are you? Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! I'm comin'! Wilson! Wilson! Wilson... Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Wilson! Wilson, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Wilson! I can't! Wilson! Wilson! I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Kelly. Kelly. Kelly. Hello? Oh, how are you? Okay. Forty-five minutes. One Dr. Pepper. Two cups of ice. I like ice. Well, here's the drill. Um, plane pulls in, we get off... and there's a little ceremony right there in the hangar. Fred Smith will say a few words. All you have to do is smile and say ""thank you."" Then we'll take you over to see Kelly. She's actually gonna be there, huh? Well, that's what we have arranged. I mean, if you're sure you wanna do that. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes. I don't know what I'm gonna say to her. What in the world am I gonna say to her? Chuck, Kelly had to let you go. You know? She thought you were dead. And we buried you. We had a funeral and a coffin and a gravestone. The whole thing. You had a coffin? What was in it? Well, everybody put something in. You know, just a cell phone or a beeper, some pictures. I put in some Elvis CDs. So you had my funeral... and then you had Mary's funeral. Stan, I'm so sorry I wasn't around when Mary died. I should've been there for you, and I wasn't. I'm so sorry. Four years ago... the FedEx family lost five of our sons. That was a terrible and tragic day. But today, one of those sons... Chuck Noland, has been returned to us. Chuck, welcome home. Just moments ago, Fred Smith welcomed home Chuck Noland. How about it, Michelle? It's such an incredible and amazing story... to come back from the dead. Well, it's so amazing that Smith himself welcomed him back. And Fred acknowledged that, ""While time waits for no man... we take time to pause to honor one of our own."" Now, that's an expensive pause. I'm-I'm sorry. I must be in the wrong place. No, you're in the right place. You probably don't remember me. I actually did root canal on you about five years ago. Jim Spaulding referred you. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Kelly's husband. Jerry Lovett. Kelly wanted... Kelly wanted to be here... Look, this is very hard for everyone. I can't even imagine how hard it is for you. Kelly, uh... She's had it rough. First when she thought she lost you... and now dealing with all of this. It's-It's confusing. It's very emotional for her. She's... She's... sort of lost. Maybe you could just give her a little more time. Anyway, uh... I'm sorry that... Okay, people, let's go. Party's over. Let's go home. Let's go home. You're definitely gonna have to go down to the DMV. Okay, Maynard, let's go. Chuck's had a big day. I have to brief this man on his meetings tomorrow... I know. With the accountants and the attorneys, all right? I will see you bright and early in the morning. - Hey, Chuck, welcome home. We love you. - Becca, I need to speak to you. You know, Chuck, we gotta catch up on some of that fishin', now. Take care. - Good night. - Good night. You got everything you need? Okay. Well, if you need anything, just sign for it... and I'll see you in the morning. Get some sleep, okay? We got another big day tomorrow. It takes a lot of paperwork to bring back a man. - Bring you back to life, man. - Bye, Chuck. - Take care, now. - Tomorrow. Tomorrow we're gonna bring you back to life. How long are you gonna be, man? Well... - how long will that buy me? - About ten minutes. I'm awake. I saw your taxi drive up. Get in here out of the rain. I saw you down at the hub today... so I know you were down there. Let me get you a towel. They're sleeping. If you come in, I'll make you some coffee. It's a nice house. Yeah, we got a nice mortgage too. What's your daughter's name? Katie. - She's a beautiful little girl. - She's a handful. Just let me get one thing straight here. We have a pro football team now, but they're in Nashville? Um, yeah. Oh, my God. Okay. They used to be in Houston. First they were the Oilers, and now they're the Titans. The Houston Oilers are the Tennessee Titans? Yeah. But that's not all. They went to the Super Bowl last year. - And I missed that. - You would've died. It was so exciting. They almost won by one yard. One lousy yard right at the end. I got whole milk, 2% and nonfat. I don't have any half-and-half, and that's what you like. That'll do fine. What happened to you becoming a professor? You're not Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett? When you, um... When your plane went down... everything just sort of got put on hold. I think about taking it up again, though. I came out here to give you this. Oh, my God. I'm sorry it doesn't work. And I, uh, I kept the picture. It was all faded anyway. I want you to have it. I gave it to you. That's a family heirloom, and it should stay in your family. That's everything I have from when you went down to now. They said they never figured out what caused the crash. Probably some mislabeled hazardous material caught fire. So here's where that ship found you. You drifted about 500 miles. This is where your island was... about 600 miles south of the Cook Islands. And these are the search grids. Ships went back and forth for weeks looking for you. I never should've gotten on that plane. I never should've gotten out of the car. I wanna show you something. Come here. This is... This is our car. You kept our car. All right, now, this is weird. It's a good car. Had a lot of memories in this car. Two very nice memories. Oh, that trip down to the Gulf, yeah. So, can I drive it? It's your car. That's good, 'cause my... my taxi's gone. Um... Let me get some stuff out of the back. You think you're gonna have more kids? I don't know. It's kind of confusing right now. Well, you should. I mean, really, you should. I would. So, what now? I don't know. I really don't know. You said you'd be right back. I'm so sorry. Me too. Chuck! Chuck! I always knew you were alive. I knew it. But everybody said I had to stop saying that... that I had to let you go. I love you. You're the love of my life. I love you too, Kelly. More than you'll ever know. Chuck? You have to go home. We both had done the math, and... Kelly added it all up. She knew she had to let me go. I added it up, knew that I'd... I'd lost her. 'Cause I was never gonna get off that island. I was gonna die there... totally alone. I mean, I was gonna get sick or I was gonna get injured or something. The only choice I had... the only thing I could control... was when and how... and where that was gonna happen. So... I made a rope. And I went up to the summit to hang myself. But I had to test it, you know? Of course. You know me. And the weight of the log... snapped the limb of the tree. So I-I... I couldn't even kill myself the way I wanted to. I had power over nothing. And that's when this feeling came over me like a warm blanket. I knew... somehow... that I had to stay alive. Somehow. I had to keep breathing... even though there was no reason to hope. And all my logic said that I would never see this place again. So that's what I did. I stayed alive. I kept breathing. And then one day that logic was proven all wrong... because the tide... came in, gave me a sail. And now, here I am. I'm back... in Memphis, talking to you. I have ice in my glass. And I've lost her all over again. I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly. But I'm so grateful that she was with me on that island. And I know what I have to do now. I gotta keep breathing. Because tomorrow, the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring? Hello! Hello! FedEx! - You look lost. - I do? Where are you headed? Well, I was just about to figure that out. Well, that's 83 South. And this road here will hook you up with I-40 East. If you turn right... that'll take you to Amarillo, Flagstaff... California. And if you head back that direction... you'll find a whole lotta nothin' all the way to Canada. I got it. All right, then. Good luck, cowboy. Thank you., It's happening! Wait up guys! - It's coming! it's coming! I'm having a baby. - code blue, code blue,  - or a pig if it's a girl - Having a baby! having a baby! I'm coming, Ellie! - Ellie?

Too bad, you'd make a wonderful mother. Manny I know your excited, I am too, but your getting a little carried away. Okay. Okay. boy, your starting to sound like Diego. Wait a second... Where is Diego? My hooves are burning baby, they are burning! Look at this, I can tip-toe! Eat my dust, Diego! - Now, can I look now? - Easy don't freak out the baby. The baby is fine. It's the freaked out daddy I'm worried about. Ah-uh-uh, No peeking. - A playground for junior. - Ohh wow! It's amazing. - Ohh Manny... - I made it myself, our family. Hey why aren't I up there? - You can be on ours. - you'd fit right in. Ofcourse it's still work in progress. few rough edges, here and there. - I don't believe it, your trying to baby proof nature. - baby proof nature? get outta here. That's ridiculous.

Come on, Sid. I don't want you touching anything. This place is for kids. Are you a kid? Don't answer that. Diego, there you are. You missed the big surprise. - I'l check it out later. - Okay, See ya. - You know, I think there's something bothering, Diego. - No, I'm sure everything's fine. - You should talk to him. - Guys don't talk to guys, about guys problems. - We just punch each other on the shoulders. - That's stupid! To a girl, but for a guy, that's like six months of therapy. Okay, Okay I'm going. - Hey. - Oww! - Why'd you do that? - I don't know. So listen, Ellie thinks theres something bothering you... Actually, I've been thinking, that soon, it might be time for me to head out. Okay, so I'l just tell her that your fine. It was nothing. Look who we kidding, Manny? I'm losing my edge. I'm not really built to chaperoning play dates. Having a family, that's huge. And I'm happy for you, but... - ...It's your adventure, not mine. - So you don't want to be around my kid? No, no, no. your taking this the wrong way. No go, go find some adventure. Mr adventure guy! Don't let my boring domestic life hit you on the bottom, on your way out. Isn't Ellie supposed to be the one with the hormonal imbalance? Manny, wait! Nobody has to leave. - So? - That's why guys don't talk to guys. - Why what happened. - Diego's leaving. Whoa, whoa, this should be the best time of our lives. we're having a baby. - No, Sid. They're havin a baby - Yeah but, we're a herd. We're a family Look things have changed. Manny has other priority's now. Face  it, Sid. We had a great run, but... now it's time to move on. - So it's just the two of us. - No, Sid. It's not the two of us.

Sid, whatever you're doing. it's a bad idea! - My kids'll, hear you. - They're not your kids, Sid. Take them back. - Your not meant to be a parent. - Why not? - First sign, stealing someone else's egg. Second sign, one of them almost became an omelet. - Someone must be worried sick looking for them. - No, they were underground, in ice. If it wasn't for me they'd be...  Egg sickles. Sid, I know what your going through. Your going to have a family to someday. Your gonna meet a nice girl, with low standards, no real options, or sense of smell. - What Manny means to say is... - I get it. I'll take them back. You have your family and I'm better off alone. By myself. a fortress of solitude. In the ice, for ever! Alone, lonely loner.. - That's alot of aloners. - Precisely! - Sid, wait. - No, no, it's ok. He'll bounce back, it's one of the advantages of being, Sid. Why sould I take you back. I love kids. I'm responsible, loving, nurturing.  What do you think? I knew you would agree. Oh oh, don't cry!

And, and those three... and her. I told you to take them back, and you kept them! Now look what they've done. - Okay granted, we do have some discipline issues. - Eating kids is not a discipline issue. - But he spit them out! - Well that's super, lets give him a gold star! They don't belong here, Sid. Whatever they are wherever you found them, take them back. Manny, I'm not getting rid of my kids! Earthquake! It's Okay, It's okay, mamma's here! Do earthquakes, shriek? - I thought those guys were extinct. - Well that is one angry fossil. Sid! Come on, inside, inside, inside. Nobody move a muscle! No, no, no, don't cry. We are poor little lambs who have lost our way. Baah, baaah! Ahhhh!!! - Sid! give them to her. She's their mother. - How do I know, she's their mother? - What do you want a birth certificate?

Not good.  Ellie! Ellie! Wait up! Okay look, if you feel anything, even if it's nothing. You gotta tell me. And we're outta here. We need a code word: ""yeah, something that says, the babies coming."" How bout, Ahh, the babies coming. How's that? Too long. We need something short and punchy. Like a... Peaches. - Peaches? - I love peaches, they sweet and round and fuzzy. - Just like you. - You think I'm round? Round is good. Round is, foxy! Stay close. - Are you guys havin the same dream I am? - We've been living above an entire world. And we didn't even know it. Run for it! Hurry. - Diego, what are you doing here? - Sight seeing. Looking for Sid, same as you! - Well aren't you noble. - This is not the time guys. We need all the help we can get! Never mind! Here, boy. Here, come on! - Are you nuts! we're not getting on that thing! - It's either this dinosaur, or that one! Pregnant lady, wants a lift. Yabba, dabba, Do! Don't ever, yabba, dabba, do that again! - I feel so... puny. - How do you think I feel? Ouch! Take cover! Dude, your awesome! Your like the brother I never had. Me too. Can we keep him? Buck. The name's Buck. Short for, Buck-meister. Long for, buh! A little dull. - What are you doing here? - A friend was taken by a dinosaur. Well his dead. Welcome to my world. Now, uh, go home. - Off you pop! - Not without, Sid. - Ellie wait, maybe the deranged hermit has a point - Manny! We came this far, we're gonna find him. - I got tracks. Let's go. If you go in there, you'll find your friend... in the after-life! How do you know? Oh great and wisely, weasely one. Mummy dinosaur carrying three babies, and some sloppy green thing? - Yeah, we're friends with the floppy green thing. - You got all that from the tracks? No, not really. I saw them come through here earlier. She's headed for Lava Falls. That's where they care, for the newborns. To get there! you got to go through the jungle of misery. Across the chasm of death. - To the plates of wow. - Whoa!!! Okay! Good luck with the slow decadence to madness, we're gonna go now. Do you think this is some tropical get-away? You can't protect your mate! mate!. What are you gonna do with those flimsy tusks..? when you run into the beast. I call him ""Rudy"". Oh good. Good. I was worried it was something intimidating, like, Sheldon or Tim. - Wait! You mean there's something bigger than mummy dinosaur..? - Aye! - Aye? - Aye! Aye! - His the one that gave me this? - Wow, he gave you that patch. - For free? That's so cool. - Yeah, maybe he'll give us one too. Welcome to my world. - Abandon all hope, he who enters there! - Alright we get it. Doom and despair. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Sounds like a jungle of misery to me. - Hold on. - Why, what's wrong? Peaches? - No, it's just I got a funny feeling. - You're hungry. Low blood sugar! - There's some fruit. - No, Manny! - I wouldn't do that, if I were you. - This isn't exactly your playground. - Like I'm going to be afraid of a pretty flower. - Bet you didn't see that coming? - Manny? Fot the record, I blame you for this. Stop eating our friends, plant! - That's it, I'm tearing it up, from the roots. - Do that and it'll clamp-shut forever. Alright, preggers. Don't get your trunk in a knot.  I'll have them out of there before they're digested. They'll be nothing but bones in 3 minutes.  Well maybe 5 for the fat one! - I'm not fat! - I feel tingly. - Don't say that, when your pressed up against me.  - Not that kind of tingly. - I can feel it too. - Help, someone help us!  - Hurry! It's time to get... Buck wild. Who's fat now? No! - Tourists. - Puked on by a plant. Awesome! - Say something. - Thank's for saving us. - Will you help us find the floppy green thing? - That's not necessary. - Yes it is. Alright I'l help ya. But I got rules. Rule number one: Always listen to Buck. Rule number two: Stay in the middle of the trail. Rule number three: He who has gas, travels at the back of the pack. - Come on then, chop, chop! - We should all have our heads examined. That's rule number four. Now, let's go find your friend. Oh it's okay, it's okay. Don't worry, we're gonna be fine. Please swing a little more to...? See, she's putting us down... No! I'm too young to be eaten. Wow! Nice mucus. And I don't care for, everyone. Listen these things get complicated.  Maybe we can work something out. I can have them on Sundays to Tuesdays? Wednesdays to Fridays? Weekends! It's Okay, mommas okay! If you eat me, it will send a bad message. Ha! Score one for the sloth! And the scores all tied up. - Do you think the beast will find, Sid? - Or more importantly, us? Rudy? Are you joking? He's relentless. He knows all, sees all eats all. So that's a, yes. Hey, get off my lawn! Go on shoo!! I knew that guy when he was a, caterpillar. You know, before he came out. So your just living down here by your wits!  All on your own, no responsibilities? Not one! It's incredible. No dependence, no limits, the greatest life a single guy can have. Did you hear that? This is my kind'a place. Hello? No, I can't talk right now. I'm trying to recover a dead sloth. They following me. I know! They think I'm crazy. We're going into the chasm of death. I'm gonna lose you. I love you too. - Alright, goddbye. Bye, bye. - Okay, follow me! That's you in three weeks. - So, why do they call it the chasm of death? - Well we tried, 'big smelly crack', - but uh, it just made everybody giggle. - Well now what? - Madam. - She is not doing that. Rule number one. Come on, mammoth. Your supposed to have a good memory. Always listen to, Buck. Now! Eyes forward. Back straight... and uh, yes, - Breathe in the toxic fumes and you'll probably die. - Toxic fumes. - Just another day in paradise. - Wait! Geronimo! - Ellie! you okay? - You have to try this.  - Alright now pile on everyone, couldn't be easier. Don't panic! Just some, technical difficulties. Keep holding it in boys. - I can't take it anymore. - He breathe it. And now I'm breathing it. - Hey we're not dead. - You sound ridiculous. Me? You should hear you. Alright. And, One, and two...  - Christmas, Christmas time is here...</ i> - Are you crazy? It's not poison. It's so disturbing. - Stop laughing, all of you! - ""Stop laughing, all of you!"" What's rule number one? - They're just laughing, what's so bad about that? - They died laughing. - Stop laughing! - Do you know what's funny though? We're trying to save, Sid and now we're all gonna die! - And I don't even like, Sid. - Who does? He's an idiot. Thank's for getting me into this mess. It's the most fun I've had in years. Thank you, for deserting the herd. That was totally super. Stop that! don't you see? We're all gonna die. We gotta do everything, huh? - Sometimes I wet my bed. - That's alright. Sometimes I wet your bed. - I'm not sure how much of that you could hear? - Oh I heard all of it. - You wet my bed? - That was, gas talk dude!. - Well, we better get moving. - Aren't we forgetting something? I'm so lonely. Okay. Here you go guys... Muncher, muncher. What! your not gonna eat your vegetables? How you going to become big and strong, dinosaurs? No... I raised them vegetarian. It's a healthier lifestyle I mean look at me. Excuse me. I'm trying to have a conversation here. No, no, no! That's not for us kids.  Way to feathery and fleshy and. ...and alive! No, no, no, we do not eat live animals, period. Now go, fly. Be free. Little, flightless bird. - My bad. - Hey, where you going? This is how you resolve a conflict? No wonder your single. Oh come on. Am I talking to myself here? I say they're vegetarian, you say, 'Grrrr' . I say can we talk about this? you say,  Grrrr. I don't call that communication. See, that's your answer to everything. What are you afraid of? You're the biggest thing on, Earth. Aren't you? - They'll never survive, it's dangerous by day! - But it's even worse at night. - Plus the guide is a lunatic! What you mean, Buck? Oh his whack-o. I am not. Totally bonkers! and his feet smell. Shut up! You shut up! Oh you little... - He's strangling his own foot. - Shouldn't we get moving? - And give, Rudy a midnight snack? Not likely. - The skulls right, take a load of mammals. We'll camp here. Now, who's hungry?  I am. You don't need the calories! There I was... My back against the wall. No way out. Perched on a razor's edge of oblivion. Staring into the eye, of the great white beast. - Were you killed? - Sadly, yes. But I lived. Never had I felt so alive, than when I was so close... To death. Just before, Rudy could suck me down his gullet. I grabbed hold of that, roast pink fleshy thing that dangles at the back of the throat. I hung on to that sucker, and I swung back and forth, back and forth. Back... and forth and back. And finally I let go and shot right out of his mouth.  I may have lost an eye that day. But I got this. Rudy's tooth... It's like the old saying: ""An eye for a tooth"". A nose for a chin. A butt for a""... - It's an old saying. But uh, it's not a very good one. - You are super weasel. - Ultra weasel. - Diesel weasel. What? He is. Now let me tell you about the time I used to sharpen, clam-shell to turn a T-Rex, - Into a T-Rex'ual. - Yes master. - That's enough fairy-tales for one night. - Come on, Ellie. You should rest now... - Alright, you guys get some shut-eye, I'll keep watch. - Don't worry, Buck, we got this.  - Night time is possum time.  - Yeah, we own the night baby. Good night, Rudy. Wait, wait. What about me? Sleep well, kids. We have a busy day tomorrow. Forging, Hunting... Missing my friends.  Probably are not missing me. What..? Your a real softie. You know that? Manny? Crash? Eddie? Manny? What's going on? Are you okay? I'm sorry. I just wanted to keep you safe, and now you're in the most dangerous place in the world. This isn't your fault. It's bigger than both of us. We have to get, Sid. Yeah, but If I had been a better friend to him... we wouldn't be here. Better friend? are you plucking my whiskers? You risked your life, your mate and your baby to save your buddy! Not the best husband or father, but... a damn good friend. Everybody stop! I smell something. It smells like a buzzard's butt fell off. And then  - got sprayed on by a bunch of, skunks. - That's, Sid. Mammal's, we have ourselves a crime scene. Half eaten carcass! hunk of...oh, no!  Broccoli! Here's what I think happened: Dinosaur attacked Sid, Sid, fights back with piece of broccoli. - Leaving dinosaur, a vegetable. - Are you nuts? Sid's not violent. Or co-ordinated. - Yeah and where's the dinosaur? - Alright, alright. Good point. Theory two: Sid's eating broccoli. Dinosaur eats Sid. Dinosaur steps on broccoli.  - Leaving broccoli, a vegetable. - Look, when exactly did you lose your mind? Three months ago. I woke up one morning married to a pineapple. An ugly pineapple. - But I loved her. - Uh, Buck! I think you missed a little clue over here. Your friend might be alive. But not for long. Rudy's closing in. You got it. The plates of, wow. Or whatever's left of them. Single file everyone.  Head for, Lava Falls. - What's that sound? - It's the wind. It's speaking to us. - What's it saying? - I don't know. I don't speak wind. - Ellie? - I'm fine, don't worry about me. I'm just taking my... Ellie! Whoa! - Manny! - Get to the ledge! - Ellie! - Ellie, where are you? - It's okay, I'm up here.  - Hang on, Ellie. We'll be right there. Wait! Sloth down! Wait... Time out. Hold up. Jeez, you guys are getting fast. It's not so bad down here. Nice weather, friendly neighbours. Hi, neighbour. - Rudy... - Rudy! - Never heard that kind of dino, before. - That's, Sid. - We'll have to move fast. - Manny. Pineapples.  - Pineapples. - She gets cravings. - Pomegranates, grapefruits, nectarines. - She's ordering a fruit cocktail. - Come on, think. Peaches! - Peaches...? Peaches! - The baby! What, what, what now...! - This not good. - The babies coming. - Can you try to hold it in! - Can somebody slap him for me?  - Just sit tight, we're coming! - There's only one thing to do. Possums, your with me. Manny you take care of, Ellie until we get back. What? No you can't leave now.  She's off the trail. What about rule number 2? Rule number 5 says, you can ignore rule number 2, if there's a female involved. - Or possibly a cute dog. I just make up these rules as I go along. - Yeah, but, but, but... she's... you have to. - Manny, it's alright. I got your back. - Now your talking. Come on, lads. - Take care of our sister. Mr. - No pressure. What does that mean, ""I've got your back?"". I'd rather they cover the front.  - That's where al the good stuff is.  - We gotta move. Okay! Alright. It's okay.  Daddy's, daddy's coming. I gotta say sweet heart, you really got timing... Go away! Go away! Shoo! Afraid of danger! Afraid of danger! Don't worry, it's just lava. Deadly, violent lava! - Boys! Are you ready for adventure? - Yes, sir! - For danger? - Yes, sir! - For death! - Er, can you repeat the question? That's right, come on! - Have you ever flown one of these before? - No, first time actually. - There she is. - Ellie! - Manny! - I need to get to her. - Listen, I'l protect, Ellie. You stop those guys. Manny, if they reach her, it'll be to late. You have to trust me. Alright, let's do it. My paws are burning baby. They burning, I gotta, tip-toe. Tip-toe, Tip-toe. - Excuse me, twinkle toes. Giving birth here. - Oh right, sorry. You okay. - Am I okay? Do you know anything about, child birth? - No, not really, but Manny's coming.. - Deigo, I'm scared? Can I hold your paw. - Yeah, of course... Just go with the pain. It's just a contraction. - Look! He's right there. - Roger. - No, Sid. - I know, Roger! How bout we get, Sid first. And then go back for, Roger. - Oh, never mind. Oh, Buck. - Wait! Wait, Sid's that way! - Tell that to them. Bring it on, you chicken headed freaks! Don't worry about a thing. You're doing fine. It's going great. Ah, excuse me. - Just keep breathing. - Diego! Just breathe, that's the important thing. Grab that ammo. - Bogey at 3'o clock. - Fire! This is awesome! Light it up! - Yeah! - Hasta la vista, birdie. Let's get our... Mayday! Mayday! We're losing altitude! Hold these. - That tastes like fish. - Okay. That's just weird. - I love you, bro! - I know! - Snap out of it, come on! Pull! - This is the end of, Sid the sloth. - Help! - No, Sid. It's me. - And me! I don't want to panic anybody, but who's flying this thing? No, no, wait, my kids! I never even got to say goodbye. - You can do it. Push! Push! - I can't do it. - Just one more big push. You have no idea what I'm going through. Okay forget I said that. Let's do this together. - I liked you guys better, when you were extinct. - Oh, I'm getting dizzy. Manny. Come on buddy. I think we're getting close. She's perfect. I think we should call her, Ellie. - Little, Ellie... - I've got a better name... Peaches. - Peaches? Why not? She's sweet, and round, and covered with furs. I love it. - I saw that, tuff guy. - No, no, that last dino caught my eye with a claw and... - Alright, so I'm not made of stone. - Incoming! It's Sid! - Oh, It's a boy! - That's it's tail. - It's a girl. Hi, sweetheart. It's uncle, Sid. Oh you're so beautiful. She looks just like her mother. Thank goodness. Oh, no offence, Manny. You're beautiful on the inside. - It's good to have you back, Sid. I never thought I would say this, but... I missed you buddy. Now I wish my kids were here. You could have been friends. Ellie! - I promised myself I wouldn't cry. - I didn't. I forgot what it was like to be part of a family. What about you? ever thought about having kids? Alright, mammal's. Let's get you home. This is it, mammal's. Right where you started. This was fun. - We could make it a regular thing. - I don't know about that. Right, Right. Yes cos' of all the uh, mortal peril. Of-course. - Oh, well, the Buck stops here. - We couldn't have done it without you. Well obviously. But, good times just the same... We're not alone, are we? Hello, Rudy. Run!

Momma... ...take good care of our kids. - You were a good parent, Sid. - Thank's. - Can I baby-sit for you. - Not a chance. - Oh come on, I work cheap. - Alright, I'll think about it.  - Yes!  - Never happened.  - He's gone. What am I supposed to do now? - That's easy. - Come with us. - You mean... up there? I never thought of going back. I've been down here so long, it feels like up to me. - I'm not sure I can fit-in up there anymore. - So look at us. We look like a normal herd to you? Ouch! So long, big guy. That's our queue. Come on peaches. He's alive. Buck...? - I... I gotta... - Yeah... Besides this world should really stay down here. - Take care of 'em, tiger. - ""Always listen to, Buck."" We're almost out. - Is everybody, okay? - Where's Buck? Don't worry. He's where he wants to be. - Is he going to be okay? - Are you kidding? Nothing can kill that weasel. It's, Rudy I'm worried about. I know this baby thing isn't for you. But whatever you decide to do... I'm not leaving, buddy. Life of adventure... It's right here. Well, I got a whole speech here. I've been working on it. how can I show you that I'm strong and... sensitive? Noble, yet caring? Thank's. Ah, they grow so fast, huh?  Look at my kids. - Seems they were born one day and then gone the next. - They were, Sid. - Yeah, it was alot of work. It's right, sweetheart. Welcome to the Ice Age. Edited by Scooby, Text: SSG - Resync: Alf Reinhart, It's me, Peter Parker. Your friendly neighborhood... you know. I've come a long way from being the boy who was bit by a spider. Back then, nothing seemed to go right for me. Now... Wow, look, it's Spider-Man! - Super cool! - Spider-man! People really like me. Hey, stick around. It's gonna start again in a couple minutes. - Nah. - That's okay. The city is safe and sound. I guess I've had something to do with that. My Uncle Ben would be proud. I still get to school. Top of my class. Now, the Hamiltonian shows us that the energy levels are perturbed by the electric field. From the form of this matrix, we can see...? Miss Stacy? That only the ""m equals zero quantum states"" are affected. Correct. Good work, Miss Stacy. Parker? You got something to add? No, sir. And I'm in love with the girl of my dreams. Hi. Miss Watson left a ticket for me. Peter Parker. Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you. Sorry. Oh. I'm so nervous. That's my girlfriend. - I thought she was good. - Yeah. Harry? Harry! I need to talk to you. Explain things. Tell it to my father. Raise him from the dead. I'm your friend, Harry. I cared about your father. M.J.! - Peter! - Congrats! - Was I good? - Good? You were great. - You were... - You said great. I love my flowers, they're beautiful. And those are from Harry. - Was he here tonight? - Yeah, I ran into him outside. - What's with you guys anyway? - It's complicated. Tell me again. Was I really good? I was so nervous. My knees were shaking. - Your knees were fine. - The applause wasn't very loud. Yes, it was. Well, it's the acoustics. It's all about diffusion. It keeps the sound waves from grouping. You see, when the sound waves, they propagate, then it's like an... You are such a nerd. - Wow. - Ooh. Did you see that one? - You know what? - Mm. I'd like to sing on-stage for the rest of my life with you in the first row. I'll be there. Tell me you love me. I love you. I love you so much. I always have. - Ready? - Yep. You can't hide here, Flint. - I'm just here to see my daughter. - You are an escaped convict. The cops are looking for you. You're not getting near her. You're nothing but a common thief. - You maybe even killed a man? - It wasn't like that. It wasn't. I had good reason for what I was doing. And that's the truth. You and the truth, sitting in prison, having three meals a day together. I live in the presence of great truth, and that is the truth that you left behind right there in that bedroom. Penny. I missed you. I miss you too, Daddy. I promise I'll make you healthy again. Whatever it takes, I'll get the money. You get out of here. Now. I'm not a bad person. Just had bad luck. Peter, what is it? It's M.J. - I'm gonna ask her to marry me. - Oh, Peter. Uh! The day your Uncle Ben asked me to marry him, we were so scared. And excited. And very young. And I loved him so fiercely. - And you said yes, right? - No. I wanted to say yes, but I said no. I wasn't ready. Neither was he. So we took our time. Looked forward to it. Didn't want to run into something with nothing to count on but love. A man has to be understanding and put his wife before himself. Can you do that, Peter? Yeah, I think I can. Then you have my blessing. Oh. I hope you've considered a proper proposal. Your uncle had it all planned. He took me to the beach one Sunday. Oh, he was a knockout in his bathing suit. And I didn't look too bad myself. We were very good swimmers. And it was a beautiful day and he said, ""Let's swim to the island."" And at the island, we found a perfect spot by an old tree and we lay down and looked up at the sky. And then he said, ""Close your eyes, May."" And I did. And then he said, ""Open them."" And I did. And he was holding this ring. Dazzling, in front of me. I thought it was the sun. We'd be married 50 years... come August, if... So... I hope you'll make it very special for Mary Jane. Do something she'll never forget. Give her this. Go on. Take it. - Harry. - You knew this was coming, Pete. Listen to me. I didn't kill your father. He was trying to kill me. He killed himself. Shut up! I'm still here, Peter. Hate those things. Oh! Harry? Harry. Harry! Oh, my God. Harry! Come on! God. - Defib. - Two hundred. And clear. No response. - Recharge, let's go again. - Go ahead. - Charging. - And clear. No response. Let's recharge and do it one more time. And clear. Captain Stacy. - What's this? - Flint Marko. The guy we tied to the Ben Parker homicide. - What about him? - He just broke out of Rikers. - And? - He's on the run. He's in the marshlands. I think we got him. There he is. You two, take the west side. Tommy, take the east. Where did he go? - Capacitors charged. - Right. Donnie, we got a little fluctuation on one. There's a change in the silicon mass. Yeah, it's probably a bird. It'll fly away when we fire it up. Initiating demolecularization. - How is he? - He's gonna be okay. But there's been some memory impairment. Particularly his short-term memory. Right now he can't remember the accident or anything that happened to him recently. Is it permanent? It could be. Only time will tell. He's awake if you wanna see him. Oh. Maybe I should wait. No, it's fine. Just keep it brief. I want him to rest. Hey, buddy. Hey. Hit my head. Yeah. Doctor said I was in an accident. Hit-and-run. I don't remember much of anything. My father... he died, right? This is all so weird. Hi. I got here as fast as I could. I know that face. How you doing? I don't know. Last thing I remember, I was fine. Somewhere. You're still fine. We love you, Harry. It feels like... somehow I've been gone for a really long time. And now I'm back home. It's good to have you back. I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you guys to scoot, okay? - Okay. - All right. Thank you. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Great. Get some sleep. - I think he's gonna be fine. - I think so. - And you guys seem great. - Yeah. You have lovely friends. My best friends. I'd give my life for them. - Yeah? - It's me. On! Hey. Peter, you know I can't open the door. It's stuck again? Just come on and help me. I'm coming. - Hey. - The review. Uh! - They hated it. They hated me. - Well, they can't hate you. ""The young Miss Watson is a pretty girl, easy on the eyes, but not on the ears. Her small voice didn't carry past the first row."" That's ridiculous, I was right there. You were in the first row. Yeah, this... Listen, you were great. That's a critic. This is something you're gonna have to get used to. Believe me, I know. Spider-Man gets attacked all the time. This isn't about you. This is about me. It's about my career. I know, and I'm just saying you can't let it bring you down. You just gotta believe in yourself and you pull yourself together. You get right back on the horse and... Don't give me the horse thing. Try and understand how I feel. It's just... I look at these words... and it's like my father wrote them. All cars-All cars in the vicinity of 54th and Sixth Avenue, please report. Crane out of control, approach with caution. ""Go get them, tiger""? I'm sorry. Oh, my God. 7-Adam to Central. That crane job you sent us on? It's bigger than we thought. We're gonna need a major mobilization right away. Shut it down at the generator. Now! Okay, Gwen, I've got a secret: It's my copier. What is that thing doing in my background? Captain Stacy, they got some kind of short up there. They can't shut down the crane. Get Edison on the phone. Have them kill the power to the whole block. Are you all right? It's coming back. Oh, no. - Oh, my God. That's Gwen. - What? What's she doing up there? I don't know, I just saw her last night. She said she had a modelling gig. - Who are you? - It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr. And I work at the Daily Bugle. And I'm dating your daughter. You Okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. Hey, Spidey, hold on. Bugle needs a photo. - Thank God you're okay. - Daddy. Hey. I'm the new guy. New Guy? You Okay? From now on, I am gonna be taking shots of you for the Bugle. So smile. Are you smiling? Just kidding. - They got a guy. - Who, Parker? Um, yeah, look, just between you and me, guy's kind of an amateur. Have you noticed his stuff makes you look a little bloated? Just... Yeah, a little chunky. Okay- But you don't have to worry about that anymore, buddy. Dazzle me. Pow. Zap. Just a little something the boys in the Ad Department and I whipped up. As you know, circulation at the Bugle's been pretty good. Though not as good as The New York Times. Or the Daily News, or the Post, or several other smaller... Get on with it, you moron...! What? Your blood pressure, Mr. Jameson. Your wife told me to tell you to watch the anger. You tell my wife... Thank you. So I propose this campaign. ""Daily Bugle."" That's obvious. ""It's hip, it's now."" I came up with that one. ""It's wow."" That's actually Erickson. He goes crazy. We gave him a couple lattes, it's like, phew! ""And how."" That's me again. Time to take your pill. Not that one. Not that one. Drink plenty of water. Thank you. Continue. - He's busy. - Oh, no. - I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful. - What's that smell? That's a little something called Nice and Easy. What's on you? It's called Go Away. Get out! That is the dumbest idea you've ever had, - and you have had some doozies. - Blood pressure. Hey, where are you going? - Who are you? - You hired him last week. Freelance. - I did? What's that smell? - It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr. - Who? What...? - Can I just say I really like that shirt? Here, it's the crane accident. - Check out the light source. - He likes my shirt. - Hey, Betty. - Hey, Pete. You better get in there. New guy. He's trying to sell some Spidey photos. Oh. Thanks. Parker. You're late, maybe too late. Bruckner here beat you to it. It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr. - But I got you this. - But he got me this. Wait, how'd you get that? I didn't see you there. How'd you get that high? - Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole. - A flagpole? - Which one do we use? - I like Bernstein's. - It's better. - Cheaper too. Congratulations, son, we'll use your shot. I'll pay you 50 bucks. All right, J.J., I'm your man. I know more about what makes a good picture than any photographer in this town. See, photography, it's not just about, no offense, flagpoles or whatever. It's about lighting. Composition. Drama. I want a staff job, sir. I have a girl that I intend to marry and I guess, I don't know, I have this stupid little dream of working with one of the greatest newspaper editors of our time. J. Jonah Jameson. Well, we do have an opening. Johnson quit, remember? - You fired him. - Whatever. Wait a minute. I know what makes a good picture and I've been here a long time. If there's a staff job, Mr. Jameson, I think I deserve it. He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us for years. He's done a great job. You want a staff job, and you want a staff job. - Anybody care about what I want? - I do. Shut up. Get out. I want the public to see Spider-Man for the two-bit criminal he really is. He's a fake, he's full of stickum. Catch him in the act. Spider-Man with his hand in a cookie jar. Whoever brings me that photo gets a job. What are you waiting for, Chinese New Year? Go, go, go. I'm on it, boss. You'll never get that shot. Oh, we'll see. You know, I guess one person can make a difference. Enough said. Welcome home, Harry. - Thank God you're all right. - Thanks, Bernard. - Bernard. - Sir. Got you a little homecoming present. - It's your old ball. - Yeah. Thanks, buddy. Hey, we were pretty good in the back yard, weren't we? We were terrible. And we tried out for the varsity team. - For the cheerleaders. - Right. - Hey, do I have any girlfriends? - I don't know. You don't? Hey, Bernard. Do I have any girlfriends? Not that I know of, sir. It's a pretty cool pad, huh? It's okay. - Looks like I'm not hurting for money. - No. Well, maybe I can turn this no-girlfriend thing around. You know, he always appreciated how you helped me through high school. Just wish I could remember more about him. Well, he loved you. That's the main thing. Hey, let's watch a game in the kitchen. Get something to eat. Okay. Whoa, heads up. Did you see that? - Still got the moves. - Yeah. Why are we stopping? What is she doing here? Well, Gary was supposed to call her agent. Hi, honey. We tried to reach you. I'm sorry. One critic? No, all the papers, dear. Mary Jane, honey, sit down. Let us explain it to you. Listen, if you'd like, we could say you became ill. That was so poorly handled. Yeah. Let's just rehearse. All right, Spidey. Spidey! Spidey! Spidey! Excuse me, miss? Could I please see that gorgeous smile? Hi, Eddie. You're so beautiful. This is front-page stuff. Okay, I've gotta practice. I'll see you later, okay? - How about tonight? - Not tonight. Why not? What about that amazing, amazing night that we had? We had coffee, Eddie. Hey, beautiful. One more. - Everything okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You're not still mad at me, are you? - No, Peter, I'm proud of you. Hey, I'm gonna be swinging in from over there. - Oh, yeah? - So you know where to look. Give them a good show. Don't worry about that review. We're gonna be laughing about it tomorrow night, I promise. Yeah. Isn't that that guy from that prison break? He fits. Hey, you. Halt. Cover the back. Hon, be careful. He's in the truck. Round the front. Fire. People of the city of New York, I am here today because I fell 62 stories and someone caught me. Someone who never asks for anything in return. Someone who doesn't even want us to know who he is. Hey, M.J. - Harry. - Hey. - Where's Pete? - Um... - Taking somebody's picture, I guess. - Right. I'm so happy to see you. You look so good, Harry. I've never felt better. It's a weird feeling not knowing who you are. Bump on the head, I'm as free as a bird. - Will you bump me on the head? - Bop. Hey, Pete said you're in a play. You came. You sent me flowers. I did? I'll come again tonight. You can't. I was let go. What happened? I wasn't very good. You know, this is embarrassing, but I once wrote you a play in high school. - You wrote me a play? - Yeah. Harry, that's the sweetest thing. So I ask you: When you're dropping without a parachute or your store's being robbed or your house is on fire, who is it that breaks your fall, puts out the flames and saves your children? Spider-Man! They love me. Then let's hear it for your one and only - friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. - Spider-man! Hey. What's up? All right. How you doing? Shazam! Woo-hoo! Hey, guys. Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Hey there. Hi. - Kiss him. - Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him. Go ahead, lay one on me. - Really? - Yeah, they'll love it. - Kiss her. - Kiss him. No, Spider-Man, no. All right. Hope Pete's getting a shot of this. Ack! Hey, hey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, man, we got something on the roof. Oh! Jig's up, pal. I don't wanna hurt you. Leave now. I guess you haven't heard. I'm the sheriff around these parts. Okay- Uh-oh. Help! Where do all these guys come from? I'm sorry, I don't speak... But this is a French restaurant, non? - Oui? - Ha, ha! - Name, please? - Parker, Peter. Ah. Here we are. Table for two. Parker. - Parker. - That is what I said: Parker. Um, I have a request. My girlfriend will be coming and I have this ring. Ah! Hello. Oh, so you want to pop the question tonight, huh? Yes, and I wanna do something very special. I love it. Romance. I am French. When I signal you, if you'd bring some champagne with the ring... - In the bottom of her glass? - Perfect. Also, I thought at the same time if the musicians would play this song... Their favorite. And take good care of the ring. Oui, with my life, monsieur. I like you. Thank you. Oh. Okay, so... Oh, would you like some champagne? How'd that get in there? Oh, don't cry. Hi. Look at you. Wow, beautiful. Thanks. This place in your budget? Oh, well, it's a special occasion. You're on Broadway. I don't feel like much of a star tonight. Well, you are a star. And you've earned it. Peter... you have no idea how I feel right now. Oh, no, I know exactly how you feel. Listen, I have been through this. It happens to me all the time. I see Spider-Man posters in the window, kids running around with me on their sweaters... Big Halloween item. I don't know, I guess I've become something of an icon. Like yesterday, they kept screaming, ""Spider-Man, Spider-Man."" I don't know, you know, I mean, I'm thinking to myself, ""I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens. Do I deserve this?"" Hi, Pete. Hi. Hi, my parents and I were just having dinner here. - Hello. I'm Gwen Stacy. - Hi. This is Mary Jane Watson. Oh! Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you. Pete talks about you all the time. Oh? Gwen is my lab partner in Dr. Connors' class. Pete's something of a genius. I'd be completely lost without him. Which actually reminds me, Pete, if you've got a picture of my kiss with Spider-Man, could you bring it to class? I'd really love it. For my portfolio. After all, who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right? I can't imagine. Well, it was lovely to meet you. - Good night. - Good night. Oh, she's in my science class. It's not her best subject. What? How come you never mentioned her? She's your lab partner? You saved her life? She thinks you're a genius and she had her polished fingernails all over you? Or didn't you notice? And she gave Spider-Man the key to the city. I'll never forget that. She's just a girl in my class. Let me ask you something. When you kissed her, who was kissing her? Spider-Man or Peter? - What do you mean? - You know exactly what I mean. That was our kiss. Why would you do that? You must have known how it'd make me feel. - Do you wanna push me away? - Push you away? Why would I wanna push you away? I love you. You're my girlfriend. She's a girl in my class, M.J. I don't feel very well. I'm sorry, I have to go. No, w... - Where are you going? - Please, don't follow me. Here we are. - Hi, it's M. J. - Sing your song at the beep. Beep. Hello. Uh... I wish you'd pick up the phone. I don't know what's going on or... I don't know if you got the messages or what. But, uh... I just wanna talk to you. Okay, call me. Bye. - Hello? - Mr. Parker? Yeah? This is Detective Neil Garrett from the 32nd Precinct. I'm calling on behalf of Captain Stacy. He would like you to come down to the station to speak with him. Originally, we thought that this man, Dennis Carradine, was your husband's killer. We were wrong. What? Turns out Mr. Carradine was only an accomplice. The actual killer is still at large. What are you talking about? This is the man who killed your husband. His name is Flint Marko. He's a small-time crook who's been in and out of prison. You got this wrong. Two days ago he escaped. Evidently, he confessed his guilt to a cellmate, and we have a couple of witnesses who will corroborate the story. No, wait, son. You don't wanna do this. No! Hey, get in! What are you doing? Would you put these photos away, please? I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker. I know this isn't easy, but, please, be patient with us. We're doing ourjob. We will catch him. No, you're not doing your job. I watched my uncle die, and we chased clown the wrong man. Now you're telling me you had suspicions for two years? Witnesses? - Why weren't we told about this? - Settle down. I have no intention of settling down. This man killed my uncle, and he's still out there! L-20 Parkway. All officers in the vicinity, please report. We have an abandoned vehicle and an elderly man in the middle of the street. Sorry, Wabash Avenue. Peter, it's M.J. I'm not here about what happened at dinner. Just please open up. Aunt May called me. She told me about what happened. She's worried about you. I'm worried about you. Don't be. I'm fine. I don't want you to do something stupid. Like try to find my uncle's killer? And do something you'll regret. Like with that other guy. He had a gun on me. I made a move and he fell. I told you that. I'm not accusing you of anything. 10-22, auto at 556... - Will you turn that thing off? - Crossing 5-6 to 5-7. Yeah, Central, this is Car 3-9 responding to your Sixth Avenue call. Peter, I'm here because I care about you. And I know that you made a mistake and that you feel guilty, but I wanna be here for you. Okay. I get it. Thank you. But I'm fine. I... I don't need your help. Everybody needs help sometimes, Peter. Even Spider-Man. Ninety X-ray, 98. Two-four King, respond to 1031 at 642 Madison Ave. One-three Thomas, respond to 1020 at 540 East 107. Male complainant inside apartment. May be on first floor. Three Henry 10-11, I have a residence. 73818... Don't hurt me. Just give me a chance! - What about my uncle? - Did you give him a chance? Did you? Where am I? What is this? I feel... Wow. This feels good. Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! This is something else. What do you think? I've never seen anything like it. I'm a physicist, not a biologist, but let me look at it in the morning. Run some tests. Can we do that now? It seems to like you. - Don't let any of that get on you. - Why not? It has the characteristics of a symbiote, which needs to bond to a host to survive. And sometimes these things in nature, when they bind, they can be hard to unbind. Bank robbery in progress, First Eastern Bank at 202 Bismark. Another sandstorm is reported in the vicinity. All cars proceed with caution. Marko. Whoa. Buddy, love the new outfit. This is exactly what I need to scoop Parker. Give some of that web action. See you, chump. What the hell? Flint Marko. - What do you want from me? - Remember Ben Parker? The old man you shot down in cold blood? What does it matter to you, anyway? Everything! It's time to pay, Marko! Good riddance. - Rent. - Not now. Listen, it's a free country. It's not rent-free country. - Leave me alone. - Give me rent. You'll get your rent when you fix this damn door! That wasn't cool. He is a good boy. He must be in some kind of trouble. Flint Marko, the man who killed Uncle Ben, he was killed last night. Oh, my. What happened? Spider-Man killed him. Spider-Man? I don't understand. Spider-Man doesn't kill people. What happened? I, uh... He... He was... I thought that you'd feel... He deserved it, didn't he? I don't think it's for us to say whether a person deserves to live or die. But, Aunt May, he killed Uncle Ben. Uncle Ben meant the world to us. But he wouldn't want us living one second with revenge in our hearts. It's like a poison. It can... It can take you over. Before you know it, turn us into something ugly. - He said it was a good idea. - Yeah. Hello? Hey, Harry, it's M.J. Hi. I need some company. Are you doing anything? Can I stop by? Yeah, sure, come on over. Okay. Are you sure it's okay? No, I'm not doing anything. Please, come over. - Okay, I'll see you soon. - Great. Bye. - Bernard. - Yes, Mr. Osborn? We're having a guest. Can you get some food? - A guest? - Yeah, a guest. - A ""guest"" guest? - Will you just get some food? Right away, sir. Hey, Mr. Ditkovitch. - An orange? - No, thanks. Listen, I'm really sorry for what happened earlier. I shouldn't have yelled about that door. It was nothing to be angry about. It's no big deal. But if you feel that bad about it, you can buy me pizza sometime. - Today's good. - Okay. - Have problem with the phone? - No, no. I was just... Well, I was trying to figure out what to say. If it's a woman you're calling, then you say, ""You're a good woman. I am good man."" Hm? - Hi, Pete. - Hi. He's calling a woman. Are you calling Mary Jane? I think that would be so good... This is none of your business. Go. Go. Call. - You should call. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Hi. - You hungry? - Yeah. Come on. - I hope you like peppers. - I love them. No. Please. Oh, the butter. Beautiful. Check this out. Oh! - Well, we can use that part. - Um, right. You've been dreaming. Nothing like a little self-deception to get you through the night. - All right. - When did you write that? - Twelfth grade. - It's intense. - So you want the part? - I'd love to be in your play. It's yours. You know, there's not even a scar. Barely. - Sorry. - Me too. - I didn't mean to do that. - No, it's okay. Please, forgive me. Mary Jane. Mary Jane. - Mary Jane, please. - I'm sorry. Just... You've taken your eye off the ball. Harry. What have you done? Avenge me! - My father, he died, right? - Yeah. Just wish I could remember more about him. Well, he loved you. That's the main thing. I swear on my father's grave, Spider-Man will pay. Harry. Remember me? Yes, Father. I remember. I was right about her. About Peter. About everything. You know what you must do. Make him suffer. Make him wish he were dead. First, we attack his heart. Hi, it's me. Sing your song at the beep. Hey, M.J. It's Peter. Uh... I wanna talk to you about last night. I don't know what I was thinking. I know you were just there to help and I... I don't know. I wanna see you. If you want Peter to live, you're gonna do something for me. - Yeah? - It's Ursula. Come in. - Hi, Pete. - Hi. There's a phone call for you. It's Mary Jane, she called back. - Really? - Yeah. I put the phone on top of the thing. Thanks. Okay. - Hey. - Hi. Oh, I'm so glad you called. I've been trying to... - Can you meet me? - You bet. - Now? - Okay. Where? At the bridge in the park. - On my Way. - Okay. Okay. Hey. I love you. You look beautiful. Peonies. - You okay? - No. There's something I have to tell you, Pete. Okay. It's not working. You and me. What? I don't wanna see you anymore. What are you talking about? I don't know. I'm lonely. You aren't there for me. I can't do this. - It's over. - No. Please. Please don't say that. I know I've been selfish, but I can do better. I can change. - It's not that simple. - We love each other. I love you. We have problems. When people have problems they work it out. They talk to each other. Look, you see? You know what this is? - You know what I want for us? - There's someone else. I've fallen in love with someone else. Bravo. She says that she's lonely, that I'm not there for her. There's another guy. Well, how you holding up? Not good. Harry, I was gonna propose to her. Really? Well, she's been going through a tough time lately. Career. I mean, a singing waitress at a jazz club? It's not exactly what she had in mind for herself. Singing waitress? What are you...? What are you talking about? Well, she was fired from the show. Didn't she tell you? She was fired? She was fired and she told you? She didn't tell me? Well, that's why I asked you here, Pete. I'm the other guy. What? Look, she came to me one afternoon, troubled. She needed someone and I was there for her. I've always loved her, Pete. You know that. It just... started. I don't believe this. I don't... I don't believe you. Look, I'm really sorry. I just thought you should know. - Can I warm you up? - Yes, please. How's the pie? So good. Would you like a drink? I'm sorry. What was I thinking? Bad for the public image, right, Mr. Key-to-the-City? What did you do to her? I did what you failed to do. I was there for her. Mary Jane and I, we understand each other. - She doesn't know what you are. - Peter, she knows me very well. And when she kissed me, it was just like she used to kiss me. That taste... Strawberries. How'd you like that, Spidey? That all you got? - Stings, doesn't it? - I protected you in high school. - Now I'm gonna kick your little ass. - Ooh! Gonna kill me like you killed my father? I'm done trying to convince you. You took him from me. He loved me. No. He despised you. You were an embarrassment to him. Oh. Look at little Goblin Junior. Gonna cry? Spider-Man used to make me feel safe. Now I'm afraid to walk home from work. My son thought the world of this guy. I have a 9-year-old daughter, loves Spider-Man. Who's she supposed to look up to? This is the guy they gave the key to the city to? I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye. Cheers to the new staff photographer. Hey, I just got lucky. This is so wonderful for you. Well, you might wanna tell J.J. to make a little more wall space. Wow, good morning. It's a beautiful day, huh? What was it you said? I'll never get that picture? - There's your hero. - Huh. - I never thought he'd really do that. - See? Right there. You made a judgment call. You gotta see it as it is. It's funny you should say that, because I was looking through some old photos and it looks very, uh, similar. Okay. Well, I gotta get back to work. - You're trash, Brock. - Excuse me? Your picture's a fake. Oh, Parker, you are such a boy scout. When are you gonna give a guy a break? You want forgiveness? Get religion. - What's going on here? - Are you guys all right? Yeah. No, we... We're just horsing around. Look, I'm begging you. If you do this, I will lose everything. There's not a paper in town that will hire me. You should've thought of that earlier. What are you doing, Peter? Show this to your editor. Tell him to check his source next time. It's a fake. Empire State Photographic Department confirms it. Pack your things. Get out of my building. - I was just trying... - You're fired. You know we're gonna have to print a retraction now. I haven't printed a retraction in 20 years. Hello. Mr. Parker, Dr. Connors here. Oh, Dr. Connors. How are you? Quite a specimen you left me, Parker. Its chemistry is not unlike the chondritic meteorites of the '70s. Thanks. - Mmm. That's good. - You know what, Parker? - Parker? - Get me some milk. It amplifies characteristics of its host. - Hey, give me another cookie. - Especially aggression. This could be dangerous. Peter, you didn't keep any, did you? You got any with nuts? I have some nuts. I could make some. - Go make me some. - Peter? No, no, no. Course not. These shots are so good. I'd love to shoot you sometime. Peter Parker. Peter. Parker. Miss Brant, that's not the position I hired you for. Black-suit Spider-Man. Peter, these are incredible. - We gotta have these, Jonah. - I'll pay you the usual rate. If you want the shots, I'll take the staff job, double the money. Penny. You are really gonna dig this joint. Do you think I'm...? I'm dressed all right? Too fancy or too...? Are you kidding me? You're looking fine, babe. Thank you. Love that little giggle. Hey, keep it open there, pops. Oh, this is so cool. I have never been to a jazz club before. Oh, I hope we can get a table. Find us some shade. Thanks, hot legs. Right this way, sir. Oh, why, thank you. - I am so loving this. - Oh, me too. - Isn't that your old girlfriend? - Yeah. - Do you wanna go some place else? - Oh, no, no. I'll... I'll be okay. - Mary Jane, show us what you got. - I'll take that. - I'll be right back. - All right. Peter? This is for you. Double-time. Thanks. Now dig on this. That is hot. Ooh. That was all for her? I'm so sorry. - You all right, Mary Jane? - I'm fine. Okay- Hey. What's wrong with you? You. - Can I help you, sir? - No. Is everything okay here, Paul? Yeah, is everything okay here, Paul? - Take him out of here. - Let's go, sir. - Take your hand off of me. - Now. - Okay. - Hey, get off. Let go. Peter, stop it! Who are you? I don't know. It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr. I come before you today... humbled... and humiliated... to ask you for one thing. I want you to kill Peter Parker. Parker. - Hi, Peter. - Hi. Hmm. You don't seem to have changed the room around very much. Of course, there's not much you could do, is there? When we spoke on the phone, I sensed that something was bothering you, so I thought I'd just come by. How's Mary Jane? I don't know. I never heard from you. Did you ever propose? You said... a husband's gotta put a wife before himself. I'm not ready. But what happened? You seemed so sure. Yeah. I, uh... I hurt her, Aunt May. I don't know what to do. Well, you start by doing the hardest thing: You forgive yourself. I believe in you, Peter. You're a good person. And I know you will find a way to put it right. In time. End of the line, Spider-Man. I want him dead too, Flint. That's why I've been looking for you. Oh, yeah. I know all about you. Like the fact that Spider-Man won't let you help your poor daughter. It's just... That doesn't seem right to me. Look, I wanna kill the spider, you wanna kill the spider. Together, he doesn't stand a chance. Interested? Yeah. So... where to? All New York is holding its breath All New York is holding its breath as the hostage crisis continues to unfold. Just 30 minutes ago, police came across this startling sight: A young woman, held hostage in a taxi suspended 80 stories above the ground in what appears to be a giant web. Every attempt by the police to rescue the hostage has been thwarted by the Sandman. Compounding the danger is the appearance of a strange black-suited figure. Early reports had believed him to be the black-suited Spider-Man, but he has now been identified as something entirely different. The hostage has been identified as Mary Jane Watson, an actress recently seen in a brief stint on Broadway. We're now going to take you live to the scene, with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer? We're only about a hundred feet away now, Hal, and... Wait. There seems to be some kind of activity in the web. They seem to be creating some kind of gigantic lettering. Apparently, Spider-Man's being challenged to some sort of confrontation. And that raises serious questions about what kind of chance he'd stand against such overwhelming... Harry? I need your help. I can't take them both, not by myself. You don't deserve my help. Harry... she needs us. Get out. If I may, sir? I've seen things in this house I've never spoken of. What are you trying to tell me? The night your father died I cleaned his wound. The blade that pierced his body came from his glider. I know you're trying to defend your father's honor, but there's no question that he died by his own hand. I loved your father... as I have loved you, Harry. As your friends love you. Look. Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man! He seems to have come out of nowhere to answer the prayers of the city, just when all hope seemed to be lost. Peter. They're gonna kill us both. - I'm gonna get you out of this. - Watch out. Hey, Parker. My God. Eddie. Ooh, my spider-sense is tingling, if you know what I'm talking about. We can find a way to settle this. You're so right. I'm thinking humiliation. Kind of like how you humiliated me. Do you remember? Do you remember what you did to me? You made me lose my girl. Now I'm gonna make you lose yours. How's that sound, tiger? Hold on, Mary Jane! Mary Jane! It's hard to believe what's happening. The brutality of it. I don't know how he can take any more. This could be a tragic day for the people of New York. It could be the end of Spider-Man. Hm? - Awesome. - Wicked cool. You came. Looks like just in the nick of time. A couple minutes ago wouldn't have been so bad either. What are you gonna do? I may need some help over here. I'm a little busy right now. Give me your hand. Parker! Parker, where...? I need a photographer. Hey, kid, you want a job? Why would I want a job? I'm just a kid. - All right, how much for the camera? - One hundred bucks. A hundred bucks? All right, you little crook. Here. What the...? Film's extra. Gotcha. Pete, up top. Mary Jane. - This thing got any more? - Hang on. To what? - Go, buddy. - Got her. You Okay? Yeah. - Good. - Hey, Pete. Am I interrupting? Never wound... what you can't kill. Eddie, the suit, you gotta take it off. Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? I know what it feels like. It feels good. The power. Everything. But you'll lose yourself. Let it go. I like being bad. It makes me happy. Harry! Peter. What are you doing? No! Eddie! - Harry. - Mary Jane. - I'm gonna get help. - No. Stay. I didn't want this. But I had no choice. We always have a choice. You had a choice when you killed my uncle. My daughter was dying. I needed money. I was scared. I told your uncle all I wanted was the car. - What is it? - I need your car. He said to me, ""Why don't you just put down the gun and go home?"" I realize now he was just trying to help me. Then I saw my partner running over with the cash. And the gun was in my hand. Get in. Did a terrible thing to you... and I spent a lot of nights wishing I could take it back. I'm not asking you to forgive me. I just want you to understand. I've done terrible things too. I didn't choose to be this. The only thing left of me now... is my daughter. I forgive you. Hey, Pal. How you doing? Been better. We'll get you through this. No. I should never have hurt you... said those things. None of that matters, Peter. You're my friend. Best friend. Harry. Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice. My friend Harry taught me that. He chose to be the best of himself. It's the choices that make us who we are, and we can always choose to do what's right., Yes, Marlin. No, I see it. It's beautiful. So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view... you didn't think you'd get the whole ocean, did you? Oh, yeah. A fish can breathe out here. Did your man deliver, or did he deliver? - My man delivered. - And it wasn't so easy. Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place. You better believe they did... every single one of them. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome. So, you do like it, don't you? No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But, Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable... with the great schools and the amazing view... but do we really need so much space? Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look, look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out... and they see a whale! Right by their bedroom window. You'll wake the kids. Oh, right, right. Aw, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them. You want to name all of them right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Junior... and this half Coral Junior. - OK, we're done. - I like Nemo. Nemo. We'll name one Nemo... but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Junior. Just think, in a couple of days... - we're going to be parents. - Yeah. What if they don't like me? - Marlin. - No, really. There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one will like you. What? - You remember how we met? - I try not to. Well, I remember. ""Excuse me, miss..."" ""can you check and see if I have a hook in my lip?"" You got a little closer because it was wiggling. - Get away, get away! - Here he is. Cutie's here. Where did everybody go? Coral, get inside the house. No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine. Just get inside... You, right now. No! Coral! Coral? Coral? Coral? Coral? Coral? There, there, there. It's OK. Daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will never let anything happen to you... Nemo. First day of school! Wake up, wake up! First day of school. I don't want to go to school... five more minutes. Not you, Dad, me. - OK? - Get up, get up. It's time for school, time for school. All right, I'm up. - Nemo! - First day of school! Nemo, don't move. You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. - You feel a break? - No. Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid rushes to the area. - Are you woozy? - No. - How many stripes do I have? - I'm fine. - Answer the stripe question. - Three. No! See? Something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three... That's all I have? You're OK. How's the lucky fin? - Lucky. - Let's see. Are you sure you want to go to school this year? There's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years. Come on, Dad, it's time for school. Forgot to brush. Do you want this anemone to sting you? - Yes. - Brush. - OK, I'm done. - You missed a spot. - Where? - There. Right there. And here and here. All right, we're excited. The first day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. What's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean? - It's not safe. - That's my boy. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out... and back in. And then we go out... and back in. And then one more time... out and back in. And sometimes, if you want to do it four times... - Dad... - All right, come on, boy. Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark. - I highly doubt that. - Have you ever met a shark? No, and I don't plan to. - How old are sea turtles? - I don't know. Sandy Plankton from next door... he says that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old. He says that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old. If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking to the shark, OK? Hold on. Wait to cross. Hold my fin. Dad, you're not going to freak out... like you did at the petting zoo, are you? That snail was about to charge. I wonder where we're supposed to go. Bye, Mom! I'll pick you up after school. Come on, you guys, stop it! Give it back! Come on, we'll try over there. Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher? Well, look who's out of the anemone. Yes. Shocking, I know. - Marty, right? - Marlin. - Bob. - Ted. Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Tell us a joke. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish. - Come on, clownie. - Do something funny. All right, I know one joke. There's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea... He doesn't walk up, he swims up. Actually, the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place, and then the sea cucumber... Well, they... I'm mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber. None of them were walking, so forget that I... Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johannsen's yard now! All right, you kids! Where'd you go? Dad, can I go play, too? Can I? I would feel better if you'd play on the sponge beds. That's where I would play. - What's wrong with his fin? - He looks funny. Hey, what'd I do? Be nice. It's his first time at school. He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin. - Dad... - See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles... but you can't really tell. Especially when I twirl them like this. I'm H-2-O intolerant. I'm obnoxious. Let's name the zones, the zones, the zones Let's name the zones of the open sea Mr. Ray! - Come on, Nemo. - You better stay with me. Mesopelagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic All the rest are too deep for you and me to see I wonder where my class has gone? We're under here! Oh, there you are. Climb aboard, explorers. Oh, knowledge exploring is, oh, so lyrical When you think thoughts that are empirical Dad, you can go now. - Hello. Who is this? - I'm Nemo. Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question. - OK. - You live in what kind of home? An anemon-none. A nemenem-menome. OK, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers. Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming... I let him take a break, 10, 15 minutes. Dad, it's time for you to go now. Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. OK, class, optical orbits up front. And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion... to ourselves. That means you, Jimmy. Aw, man! Bye, Nemo! Bye, Dad! Bye, son! Be safe. You're doing pretty well for a first-timer. You can't hold on to them forever, can you? I had a tough time with my oldest out at the drop off. They got to grow up... The drop off? They're going to the drop off? What are you, insane? Why don't we fry them up now and serve them with chips? Hey, Marty, calm down. Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy. Pony boy? For a clownfish, he really isn't that funny. Pity. Let's name the species, the species, the species Let's name the species that live in the sea There's Porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma And some fish like you and me Come on, sing with me. Just the girls this time. Oh, seaweed is cool Seaweed is fun it makes its food OK, the drop off. All right, kids, feel free to explore... but stay close. Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather. An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck. There are as many protein pairs contained in this... Come on, let's go. Come on, sing with me! There's porifera, coelenterata Hydrozoa, scyphozoa Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three Hey, guys, wait up! Cool. Saved your life! Aw, you guys made me ink. What's that? I know what that is. Sandy Plankton saw one. He said it was called a butt. That's a pretty big butt. Oh, look at me. I'm going to touch the butt. Oh, yeah? Let's see you get closer. OK. Beat that. Come on, Nemo. How far can you go? My dad says it's not safe. - Nemo! No! - Dad? You were about to swim into open water. No, I wasn't... Good thing I was here. If I hadn't shown up... - He wasn't going to go. - He was too afraid. No, I wasn't. This does not concern you, kids... and you're lucky I don't tell your parents. You know you can't swim well. I can swim fine, Dad, OK? No, it's not OK. You shouldn't be near here. OK, I was right. You'll start school in a year or two. No, Dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean... Clearly, you're not ready... and you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do these things... but you just can't, Nemo! I hate you. There's Nothing to see. Gather. Over there. Excuse me. Is there anything I can do? I am a scientist, sir. Is there any problem? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer, and it's a little too soon... for him to be out here unsupervised. I can assure you, he's quite safe with me. I'm sure he is, but you have a large class... and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking. Oh, my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea! Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You'll get stuck out there... and I'll have to get you before another fish does. Get back here! I said get back here now! Stop! You take one more move, mister... Don't you dare! If you put one fin on that boat... Are you listening to me? Don't touch the bo... Nemo! He touched the butt. You paddle your little tail right back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big... Big... Daddy! Help me! I'm coming, Nemo! Get under me, kids! Oh! No! Dad! Daddy! Oh! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Nemo! Nemo! Hold on. Oh, no. No. No, it's gone. It's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no! Has anybody seen a boat? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please. - Look out! - What? Oh, oh. Sorry. I didn't see you. - Sir? Are you OK? - He's gone, he's gone. There, there. It's all right. - He's gone. - It'll be OK. No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat. A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. - You have? - It passed by not too long ago. - A white one? - Hi. I'm Dory. Where? Which way? It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. No problem. Hey... Wait! - Will you quit it? - What? I'm trying to swim here. Ocean isn't big enough for you? You got a problem, buddy? Do you? Do you? You want a piece of me? I'm scared now. What? - Wait a minute. - Stop following me, OK? What? You're showing me where the boat went. A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny. And I know funny. I'm a clownfish. No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. Short-term memory loss. I don't believe this. No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. At least, I think it does. Where are they? Can I help you? Something's wrong with you... really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. Hello. Well, hi! Name's Bruce. It's all right. I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of bites like you... doing out so late, eh? We're not doing anything. We're not even out. Great! Then how'd you morsels... like to come to a little get-together I'm having? You mean, like a party? Yeah, right. A party. What do you say? I love parties. That sounds like fun. Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but... Oh, come on, I insist. OK. That's all that matters. Hey, look, balloons. It is a party. Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want one of them to pop. Anchor! Chum! There you are, Bruce. Finally. - We got company. - It's about time, mate. We've already gone through the snacks... and I'm still starving. We almost had a feeding frenzy. Come on, let's get this over with. Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge. I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image... I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food. Except stinkin' dolphins. Dolphins. Yeah. They think they're so cute. ""Look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin."" ""Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?"" Right, then. Today's meeting is Step 5... Bring a Fish Friend. Do you all have your friends? Got mine. - Hey, there. - How about you, Chum? Oh, I... seem to have misplaced my friend. That's all right, Chum. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step. You can help yourself to one of my friends. Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum? I'll start the testimonies. Hello. My name is Bruce. Hello, Bruce. It has been three weeks since my last fish. On my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup. - You're an inspiration! - Amen. Right, then. Who's next? Pick me, pick me. Yes. The little Sheila down the front. Come on up here. Hi. I'm Dory. - Hello, Dory. - And well... I don't think I've ever eaten a fish. - That's incredible. - Good on you, mate. I'm glad I got that off my chest. All right, anyone else? How about you, mate? What's your problem? Me? I don't have a problem. Oh, OK. Denial. Just start with your name. OK. Hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish. - A clownfish? Really? - Tell us a joke. I love jokes. I actually do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk... and he walks up to a sea cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers... but in a joke, everyone talks... so the sea mollusk says to the cucumber... Daddy! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! I don't get it. For a clownfish, he's not that funny. No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers. Oh, my. You poor fish. Humans... think they own everything. Probably American. Now, there is a father... Looking for his little boy. What do these markings mean? I never knew my father! - Group hug. - We're all mates here, mate. I can't read human. We got to find a fish that can read this. - Hey, look, sharks. - No, no, no, Dory! - Guys, guys. - No, Dory. That's mine. Give it to me. Gimme! Oh, I'm sorry. Are you OK? I'm so sorry. You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding? Dory, are you OK... That's good. That's good. Intervention! - Just a bite. - Hold it together, mate! Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food! - Food! - Dory, look out! I'm having fish tonight! Remember the steps, mate! Just one bite! G'day. Grr! There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape! Who is it? Dory, help me find a way out! Sorry. Come back later. We're trying to escape. - There's got to be a way out! - Here's something. ""Es-cap-e."" I wonder what that means. Funny. It's spelled just like ""escape."" Let's go. Here's Brucey! Wait a minute. You can read? I can read? That's right. I can read! Well, then, here. Read this now. He really doesn't mean it. He never even knew his father. Don't fall off the wagon! Oh, no, it's blocked! No, Bruce, focus. Sorry about Bruce, mate. He's really a nice guy. I need to get that mask. You want that mask? OK. No, no, no, no, no, no! Quick, grab the mask! Oh, no. Bruce? What? Swim away! Swim away! Aw, is the party over? Nice. Dad? Daddy? Barbara. Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please? And I'm going to need a few more cotton rolls. OK. Hello, little fella. Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life... out on the reef, and I saved him. So, has that Novocaine kicked in yet? I think so. We're ready to roll. Bubbles! My bubbles. He likes bubbles. No! Bonjour. Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about. - He's scared to death. - I want to go home. Do you know where my dad is? Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store. Pet store? Yeah, you know, like, I'm from Bob's Fish Mart. - Pet Palace. - Fish-O-Rama. - Mail order. - Ebay. - So, which one is it? - I'm from the ocean. The ocean. The ocean? He hasn't been decontaminated. Jacques! - Oui. - Clean him! Oui. - Ocean. - La mer. Bon. Voila. He is clean. The big blue. What's it like? - Big and blue? - I knew it. If there's anything you need, just ask your Auntie Deb. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Flo. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's nuts. We got a live one. - Can't hear you, Peach. - I said we got a live one. - Boy, oh, boy. - What do we got? Root canal... and by the looks of those x-rays... it's not going to be pretty. - Dam and clamp installed? - Yep. - What did he use to open? - Gator-Glidden drill. He seems to favor that one lately. I can't see, Flo. You're getting a little too... Now he's doing the Schilder technique. He's using a Hedstrom file. That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex. It has a teardrop cross-section. Clearly a Hedstrom. - No, no, K-Flex. - Hedstrom. - K-Flex! - Hedstrom! There I go. A little help, over here. I'll go deflate him. All right. Go ahead and rinse. Oh, the human mouth is a disgusting place. - Hey, Nigel. - What did I miss? Root canal... a doozy. Root canal? What did he use to open? - Gator-Glidden drill. - He's favoring that one. Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus. - Hello. Who's this? - New guy. The dentist took him off the reef. An outie. From my neck of the woods, eh? Sorry if I ever took a snap at you. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat. Hey! No, no, no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go. Go on, shoo! Aw, the picture broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece. She's going to be eight this week. Hey, little fella. Say hello to your new mummy. She'll be here Friday to pick you up. You're her present. It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up... I'm going to see a man about a wallaby. Oh, Darla. What? What's wrong with her? She wouldn't stop shaking the bag. - Poor Chuckles. - He was her present last year. Hitched a ride on the porcelain express. She's a fish killer. I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my dad. Daddy! Help me! Oh, he's stuck. Nobody touch him. Nobody touch him. Can you help me? No. You got yourself in there. You can get yourself out. - Gill... - I want to see him do it. Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail. I can't. I have a bad fin. Never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do. Come on. Perfect. - Yay! - You did it! Good squirming. From the ocean... just like you, Gill. Yeah. I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking... tonight, we give the kid a proper reception. So, kid, you got a name or what? Nemo. I'm Nemo. Nemo. Nemo. Are you gonna eat that? Careful with that hammer. No, no. What does it say? Dory! A sea monkey has my money. Wake up. Get up. Come on. Come on! - Yes, I'm a natural blue. - Get up! Look out! Sharks eat fish! Dusty. The mask. Where's the mask? No! No, not the mask! Get it! Get the mask! Get the mask! Get it! Hoo doot doo doot doot doo doot La la la la la la it just keeps going on, doesn't it? Echo! Echo! Hey, what you doing? It's gone. I've lost the mask. - Did you drop it? - You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills... when life gets you down, know what you got to do? - I don't want to know. - Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming What do we do? We swim, swim Dory, no singing. Ho ho ho ho ho ho I love to swim When you want to swim See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song. - Now it's in my head. - Sorry. Dory, do you see anything? - Something's got me. - That was me. I'm sorry. - Who's that? - Who could it be? It's me. Are you my conscience? Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you? - Can't complain. - Yeah? Good. Now, Dory, I want you to tell me... Do you see anything? I see a... I see a light. - A light? - Yeah. Over there. - Hey, conscience, am I dead? - No. I see it, too. What is it? It's so pretty. I'm feeling... happy... which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it. Hey, come back. Come on back here. I'm gonna get you I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna swim with you I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend Good feeling's gone. I can't see! I don't know where I'm going! - The mask! - What mask? OK, I can't see a thing. - Oh, gee. - Hey, look, a mask. Read it! I'm sorry, but if you could just... bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light. That's great. Keep it right there. - Just read it! - OK, OK. Mr. Bossy. ""P."" OK. ""P. Sher..."" ""Sher... P. Sher..."" P. Shirley? P..."" Oh. The first line's ""P. Sherman."" ""P. Sherman"" doesn't make any sense! OK. Second line. ""42."" Don't eat me. Don't eat me. Light, please! ""Walla... walla..."" Waah! Waah! Waah! The second line's ""42 Wallaby Way."" That's great. Speed read. Take a guess. No pressure. No problem. There's a lot of pressure. Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure! - ""Sydney""! It's ""Sydney""! - Duck! I'm dead. I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead. I died. I'm dead. We did it, we did it Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah No eating here tonight, whoo! Eating here tonight No, no, no, eating here tonight - Dory. - You on a diet Dory! What did the mask say? P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered what it said! I usually forget things, but I remembered it! Wait. Where is that? I don't know. But who cares? I remembered. Raar! P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again! Nemo. Nemo Suivez-moi. Follow me. Hahoo wahoo yahoo ho Hahoo wahoo yahoo ho Hahoo ho ho wahoo ha hee Ha ho wahee ha ho ho ho Hoo! State your name. Nemo. Brother Bloat, proceed. Nemo, newcomer of orange and white... you have been called forth... to the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie... to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood. We want you in our club, kid. - Really? - If... you are able to swim through... the Ring of Fire! Turn on the Ring of Fire! You said you could do it. The Ring of Fire! Bubbles, let me... Oh! Ha hwa ha ho ho ho Ha hwa ha ho ho ho Ha hwa ha ho ho ho Isn't there another way? He's just a boy! From this moment on, you will be known as Sharkbait. Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha! Welcome, Brother Sharkbait. Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha! - Enough with the Sharkbait. - Sharkbait! Ba-ba-do. Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed? - Agreed. - We can't send him to his death. Darla's coming in five days. So, what are we going to do? I'll tell you what we're gonna do... we're gonna get him out of here. - We'll help him escape. - Escape? Really? We're all gonna escape. Gill, please. Not another escape plan. Sorry, but they just never work. Why should this be any different? - Because we've got him. - Me? - You see that filter? - Yeah. You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. We need you to take a pebble inside there... and jam the gears. You do that, and this tank's gonna get... filthier and filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank... and when he does, he'll take us out of the tank... put us in individual baggies... then we'll roll ourselves down the counter... out the window, off the awning... into the bushes, across the street... and into the harbor! It's foolproof. Who's with me? - Aye! - Aye! I think you're nuts. No offense, kid, but you're not the best swimmer. He's fine. He can do this. So, Sharkbait, what do you think? Let's do it. I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going? I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. If you ask where I'm going... I'll tell you that's where I'm going. It's P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Excuse me. Hi. Do you know how to get... Hello? Wait. Can you tell me... Hey! Hold it! I'm trying to talk to you! Fellas, come back here. One quick question. I need to... And they're gone again. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell you again. I don't get tired of it... OK, all right. Here's the thing. I think it's best if I carry on from here by... by myself. OK. You know, alone. Without... without... I mean, not without you. But I don't want you... with me. Am I... I don't want to hurt your feelings. - You want me to leave? - I mean, not... Yes. I just can't afford any more delays... and you're one of those fish that cause delays. Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish. They're delay fish. You mean... You mean you don't like me? No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion. Don't cry. I like you. Hey, you! Lady, is this guy bothering you? I don't remember. Were you? No, no, no, no, no. We're just... Do you guys know how I can get to... Look, pal, we're talking to the lady, not you. Hey, hey. You like impressions? Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen. So what are we? Take a guess. I've seen one of those. I'm a fish with a nose like a sword. - Wait, wait... - It's a swordfish! Hey, clown boy, let the lady guess. Where's the butter? It's on the tip of my tongue! - Lobster. - Saw that! Lots of legs! Live in the ocean. - Clam! - Close enough! Oh, it's a whale of a tale I'll tell you, lad... They're good. Will somebody please give me directions?! ""Will somebody please give me directions?!"" I'm serious! ""Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!"" ""Blah blah blah, me, me, me!"" Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back! - Hey, what's the matter? - What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions... I am miles from home with a fish that can't remember her name! I bet that's frustrating. Meanwhile, my son is out there. - Your son Chico? - Nemo? But it doesn't matter because no fish... in this entire ocean is going to help me. Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. - Guys! - Is he bothering you again? No, no. He's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his son Fabio. Any of you heard of P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney? Sydney? Oh, sure! Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. - Don't you, Ted? - Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know Sydney! You wouldn't know how to get there, would you? You want to follow the E.A.C. That's the East Australian Current. Big current. Can't miss it. It's in... that direction. And then you follow that for about... I don't know. What do you guys think? About three leagues? That little baby will put you right past Sydney. - Ta-da! - That's great! Dory, you did it! Oh, please, I'm just your little helper. - Helping along. That's me. - Fellas, thank you. Don't mention it! Just loosen up, OK, buddy? Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye. Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing. When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it. Trench... through it, not over it. I'll remember. Hey, hey! Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! I gotta tell you something. Nice trench. Hello! - OK, let's go. - No, no. Bad trench. Come on, we'll swim over this thing. Partner. Little red flag going up. Something's telling me to swim through it, not over it. Are you looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it. I really, really, really think we should swim through. And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go. - Trust me on this. - Trust you? Yes, trust. It's what friends do. Look! Something shiny! - Where? - It just swam over the trench. - Come on, we'll follow it! - OK! Boy, it sure is clear up here. Exactly. And look at that... there's the current. We should be there in no time. Hey, little guy. You wanted to go through the trench. I shall call him Squishy, and he shall be mine. And he shall be my Squishy. Come here, Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. - That's a jellyfish! - Bad Squishy! Shoo, shoo! Get away! - Let me see that. - Don't touch it. I won't touch it. I just want to look. Hey! How come it didn't sting you? It did. It's just that... Hold still. I live in this anemone... and I'm used to these kind of stings. It doesn't look bad. You'll be fine. But now we know, don't we... that we don't want to touch these again. Let's be thankful this time it was just a little one. Don't move. - This is bad, Dory. - Hey, watch this! Boing! Boing! Dory! You can't catch me Don't bounce on the tops! They will... not sting you! - The tops don't sting you! - Two in a row! Beat that! Dory, listen to me. I have an idea... a game. - A game? - Yes. - I love games! Pick me! - Here's the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish wins! - OK. - Rules, rules, rules! You can't touch the tentacles. Only the tops. Something about tentacles. Got it. Go! Wait! Not something about 'em, it's all about 'em! - Whee! - Wait, Dory! Gotta go faster if you want to win! Dory! Boing, boing, boing! Wait a minute! Dory! Whee! We're cheating death now. That's what we're doing. But we're having fun at the same time. I can do this. Just be careful. Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win! I don't think so! Give it up, old man. You can't fight evolution. I was built for speed. The question is, Dory, are you hungry? - Hungry? - Yeah. 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The clownfish is the winner! We did it! Look at us! Dory? Oh, no. Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory! Am I disqualified? No, you're doing fine! You're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Where does P. Sherman live? P. Sherman... Wallaby Way, Sydney... That's it! - Wallaby Way... - Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay... awake! - Awake. - P. Sherman. - Awake. - 42 Wallaby Way. Wake up. Nemo... You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait? Yeah. You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you. He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean. Peach, any movement? He's had four cups of coffee. It's gotta be soon. Keep on him. My first escape... landed on dental tools. I was aiming for the toilet. Toilet? All drains lead to the ocean, kid. How many times have you tried to get out? I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to you. Bubbles! Bubbles! Potty break! He grabbed the ""Reader's Digest."" - We have 4.2 minutes! - That's your cue, Sharkbait. - You can do it, kid. - We gotta be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the chamber... and I'll talk you through the rest. - OK. - It'll be a piece of kelp. Nicely done! - Can you hear me? - Yeah! Here comes the pebble. Ptoo. Now, do you see a small opening? Inside it, you'll see a rotating fan. Wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning. - Careful, Sharkbait! - I can't do it! Gill, this isn't a good idea. He'll be fine. Try again! OK. That's it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady. I got it! I got it! - He did it! - That's great, kid! Now swim up the tube and out. Oh, no! Gill! - Sharkbait! - Oh, my gosh! Get him outta there! - What do we do? - Oh, no! Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic! Help me! Sharkbait, grab hold of this! - No! No! No! - Feed me more! - That's it! - Sharkbait! Grab it! I got it! Pull! Gill, don't make him go back in there. No. We're done. Dude. Dude. Focus, dude. Dude. Oh, he lives. Hey, dude! What happened? Saw the whole thing, dude. First, you were all, like, ""Whoa!""... and then we were all, like, ""Whoa!""... and then you were, like, ""Whoa."" What are you talking about? You, mini-man. Takin' on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude. Awesome. Oh, my stomach. Oh, man. No hurlin' on the shell, dude, OK? Just waxed it. So, Mr. Turtle... Dude. Mr. Turtle is my father. The name's Crush. Crush? Really? OK, Crush. I need to the East Australian Current. E.A.C.? Oh, dude. You're ridin' it, dude! Check it out! OK, grab shell, dude! Grab wh-a-a-at?! Righteous! Righteous! - Yeah! - Stop! So... What brings you on this fine day to the E.A.C.? Dory and I need to get to Sydney. Dory! Is she all right? Oh, little blue. She is sub-level, dude. Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. It's my fault. Twenty-nine, thirty! Ready or not, here I come! There you are! Dory? Nice wave! Up you go! - Oh, my goodness! - Kill the motor, dude. Let us see what Squirt does flying solo. That was so cool! Hey, Dad, did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did? You so totally rock, Squirt! So give me some fin. Noggin. - Dude. - Dude. Oh... intro. Jellyman, offspring. Offspring, Jellyman. - Jellies?! Sweet. - Totally. Apparently, I must've done something you liked... dudes. You rock, dude! Curl away, my son. It's awesome, Jellyman. The little dudes are just eggs. We leave 'em on a beach to hatch... and then, coo-coo-cachoo... they find their way back to the big ol' blue. - All by themselves? - Yeah. But, dude, how do you know when they're ready? Well, you never really know. But when they know, you'll know, you know? Ha. Hey, look, everybody. I know that dude! It's the Jellyman! Go on. Jump on him! - Turtle pile! - Wait, wait, wait! - Are you funny? - Where's your shell? - I need to breathe! - Are you running away? Did you really cross the jellyfish forest? - Did they sting you? - One at a time! Mr. Fish, did you die? Sorry, I was a little vague on the details. So, where are you going? You see, my son was taken. My son was taken away from me. - No way. - What happened? No, no, kids. I don't want to talk about it. Aww! Please? Please? Well, OK. I live on this reef a long, long way from here. This is gonna be good. I can tell. And my son Nemo... See, he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it... if I hadn't been so tough on him. I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat... and when he was out there, these divers appeared... and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast. So, we swam out in the ocean to follow them... They couldn't stop 'em. And then Nemo's dad... he swims out to the ocean, and they bump into... three ferocious sharks. He scares away the sharks by blowing 'em up! Golly, that's amazing. And then dives thousands of feet... straight down into the dark. It's wicked dark down there. You can't see a thing. How's it going, Bob? And the only thing they can see down there... is the light from this big, horrible creature... with razor-sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man. And then he has to blast his way... So, these two little fish have been... searching the ocean for days on the East Australian Current. Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put him in Sydney Harbor... In a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like... this guy is gonna stop at nothing... till he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it. That's one dedicated father, if you ask me. Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Would you just shut up?! You're rats with wings! Bloke's been looking for his boy Nemo. - Nemo?! - He was taken off the reef... - Take it! You happy? - Mine! Mine! Mine! Hey, say that again! Something about Nemo. Mine! Mine! Mine! Whoooa... Mine? Last I heard, he's heading towards the harbor. Brilliant! Is he doing OK? Whatever you do, Don't mention D-a-r... It's OK. I know who you're talking about. Gill? Gill? Hey, Sharkbait. I'm sorry I couldn't stop the... No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out... so ready to taste that ocean... I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that. I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid. All right. Hey, hey, hey... What the... That's one way to pull a tooth. Darn kids. Good thing I pulled the right one, eh, Prime Minister? Hey. Oh, Nigel! You just missed an extraction. Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet? What am I talking about? Where's Nemo? - I've got to speak with him. - What is it? Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean... - looking for you. - My father? Really? He's traveled hundreds of miles, battling sharks and jellyfish... Sharks? That can't be him. What was his name? Some sort of sport fish. - Tuna? Trout? - Marlin? Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef. It's my dad! He took on a shark! I heard he took on three. - Three sharks? - That's 4,800 teeth! After you were taken by Diver Dan over there... your dad followed the boat like a maniac. Really? He's swimming, giving it all he's got... and then three gigantic sharks capture him... and he blows them up and dives thousands of feet... and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock, and what's his reward? He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest! Now he's with a bunch of sea turtles on the E.A. C... and the word is he's headed this way right now... to Sydney! What a good daddy! He was looking for you after all, Sharkbait. He's swimming to the filter! - Sharkbait! - Not again! Sharkbait! No! You got your whole life ahead of you! - We'll help you, kid! - Get him out! Get him out of there! Come on, kid! Grab the end! Sharkbait! - No! - Can you hear me? Nemo! Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Sharkbait, you did it! Sharkbait, you're... covered with germs! That took guts, kid. All right, gang, we have less than 48 hours... before Darla gets here. This tank'll get plenty dirty in that time... but we have to help it along any way we can. - Jacques? No cleaning. - I shall resist. Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're gonna make this tank so filthy... the dentist will have to clean it. Good work! All right, we're here, dudes! Get ready! Your exit's coming up, man! Where? I don't see it! Right there! I see it! I see it! The swirling vortex of terror? - That's it, dude. - Of course it is. OK, first, find your exit buddy. Do you have your exit buddy? Yes! Squirt give you a rundown of proper exiting technique. Good afternoon! We'll have a great jump today! OK, crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall. There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out! Remember... rip it, roll it, and punch it! He's trying to speak to me, I know it! You're really cute, but I don't know what you're saying! Say the first thing again. OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go! That was... fun! I actually enjoyed that. Hey, look, turtles! Most excellent! Now turn your fishy tails around... and swim straight on through to Sydney! No worries, man! No worries! Thank you, dude Crush! - Bye! - Bye, Jellyman! You tell your little dude I said hi, OK? See ya later, dudes! Bye, everyone! Nemo would have loved this. Hey! Crush, I forgot! How old are you? 150, dude! And still young! Rock on! I gotta remember that. - We going in there? - Yep. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney? Yep. We're gonna just swim straight. Just keep swimming, just keep swimming Dory... Boy, this is taking awhile. How about we play a game? OK. OK, I'm thinking of something orange... and it's small... - It's me. - Right! It's orange and small... It's me. All righty, Mr. Smartypants. And it's orange and small and white stripes... Me. And the next one, just a guess, me. - That's just scary. - Wait, wait, wait. I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it before... and that means we're going in circles... and that means we're not going straight! - Hey, hey! - Get to the surface. We'll figure it out up there. Let's go! - Hey! Relax. - What? Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions. Fine. Who do you want to ask, the speck? - There's nobody here! - There has to be someone. It's the ocean, silly. We're not the only two in here. Let's see. OK, no one there. Nope. Nada. There's somebody. Hey! Excuse... Dory, Dory, Dory! Now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious. It's a fish we don't know. If we ask it directions... it could ingest us and spit out our bones! What is it with men and asking for directions? I don't want to play the gender card right now. Let's play the ""Let's Not Die"" card. - You want to get out of here? - Of course I do. How are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot? Dory, you don't fully understand... Come on. Trust me on this. All right. Excuse me! Little fella? Hello! Don't be rude. Say Hi. Ha. Hello. - His son Bingo... - Nemo. - Nemo was taken to... - Sydney. Sydney! And it's really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out? Come on, little fella. Come on. Dory, I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella. Oh! Big fella. Whale. OK. Maybe he only speaks whale. Mooo! Weee neeed... - Dory? - Tooo fiind his son. What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale? Can youuuu give us diiirectionsss? Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! - See, he's swimming away. - Cooome baaack. He's not coming back. You offended him. Maybe a different dialect. Dory! This is not whale. You're speaking upset stomach. - Maybe I should try humpback. - Don't. - You actually sound sick. - Maybe louder? - Rah! Rah! - Don't do that! Too much orca. Didn't it sound orca-ish? It doesn't sound orca. It sounds like nothing I've ever heard. It's just as well. He might be hungry. Whales don't eat clownfish. They eat krill. - Swim away! - Oh, look, krill! Move, Dory, move! Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. All thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look! Scum angel! Bubbles! I love the bubbles! Flo? Has anybody seen Flo? 9:00 and cue dentist. Hello, Barbara. Sorry I'm late. OK, here we go. Here we go, OK. Little Davey Reynolds... Walks to the counter, drops the keys... Bloat, that's disgusting! Tastes pretty good to me. - Urrrp! - Eww! Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own... Here he comes! Crikey. What a state. Barbara, what's my earliest appointment tomorrow? - 10:00, luv. - Leave it open, would you? I've gotta clean the fish tank before Darla gets here. Did you hear that, Sharkbait? Yay! He's gonna clean the tank! We're gonna be clean! You ready to see your dad, kid? Of course you are. I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there... in the harbor waiting for you right now. Yeah. Here comes the big one. Come on! You gotta try this! - Will you just stop it? - Why? What's wrong? We're in a whale, don't you get it? - Whale? - A whale! You had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here! A whale. I speak whale. No, you're insane! You can't speak whale! I have to get out! I have to find my son! I have to tell him how old sea turtles are! Hey... you OK? There, there. It's all right. It'll be OK. No. No, it won't. Sure it will. You'll see. No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him. That's a funny thing to promise. What? You can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him. Not much fun for little Harpo. What's going on? Don't know. I'll ask him. - Dory... - Whaaat's goooing onnn? I think he says we've stopped. Of course we've stopped. Stop trying to speak whale. You'll make things worse. What is that noise? Oh, no. Look what you did. The water's going down. It's going down! Really? You sure about that? Look! Already it's half empty! I'd say it's half full. Stop that! It's half empty! OK, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat... or he wants a root beer float. Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby? Do I taste good? Tell him I'm not interested in being lunch! - OK. Heee... - Stop talking to him! What is going on? I'll check. Whaaat... No more whale! You can't speak whale! - Yes, I can! - No, you can't! You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nemo! - OK. - Dory! Oof! He says it's time to let go. Everything's gonna be all right. How do you know? How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen? I don't! We're alive! Look! Sy-d-ney... Sydney! Sydney! Sydney again! You were right, Dory! We made it! We're gonna find my son! Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr! I wish I could speak whale. All we gotta do is find the boat that took him. - Right! - We can do this! Morning. It's morning, everyone! Today's the day! The sun is shining, the tank is clean... and we are getting out... The tank is clean. The tank is clean! But how? Boss must've installed it while we were sleeping. - What are we gonna do? - What's it say, Peach? I can't hear you, Peach. The Aquascum 2003 is an all-purpose, self-cleaning... maintenance-free, salt water purifier... that is guaranteed to extend the life of your aquarium fish. Stop it! The Aquascum is programmed to scan... your tank environment every five minutes?! Scan? What does that mean? Temperature... 82 degrees... PH balance... normal. Nice. Curse you, Aquascum! That's it for the escape plan. It's ruined. Then what are we gonna do about... Darla! Stay down, kid! False alarm. My nerves can't take much more of this. What'll we do when that brat gets here? - I'm thinking. - Oh! Gill! - Nemo! I'm coming! - Help me! Help me! Swim down! Come on, kid! - Everybody jump in! - Swim down! - That's it! - What the...? - Yay! - Good work! Gill! - Nemo! - Sharkbait! - Roll, kid! - Lean! Lean! Whoops. That would've been a nasty fall. Gill! Don't let me go belly-up! Just calm down, Nemo. You won't go belly-up. I promise. You're gonna be OK. Darla! Do any of these boats look familiar to you? No, but the boat has to be here somewhere. Come on, Dory. We're gonna find it. I'm totally excited. Are you excited? Dory, wake up. Wake up, come on. Duck! That's not a duck. It's a... pelican! No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast! Hey, Nigel. Would you look at that? What? What? Sun's barely up and Gerald's had more than he can handle. Yeah. Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy. Yeah, right. Yeah. Don't everybody fly off at once. All right, Gerald. Fish got your tongue? Love a duck! I gotta find my son Nemo! Nemo? He's that fish! The one that's been fighting the whole ocean! I know where your son... Wait! Come back! Stop! Dory, keep going! He's crazy! I got something to tell you! Mine. Don't make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live. Hop in your mouth? How does that make me live? Mine? Because I can take you to your son. - Yeah, right. - No. I know your son. He's orange with a gimpy fin on one side. That's Nemo! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Fasten your seat belts! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Everybody hold on! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Too loud! Too loud for me! Twinkle, twinkle, little star Find a happy place! Find a happy place! Darla, your uncle will see you now. All right, let's see those pearly whites. Raah! I'm a piranha. They're in the Amazon. And a piranha's a fish, just like your present. I get fishy, fishy Oh, no. Poor little guy. - He's dead. - Sharkbait! Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy! Must've left your present in the car, sweetie. I'll go and get it. - He's still alive! - He's not dead! What's happening? Why is he playing dead? He's gonna get flushed down the toilet. - He's gonna get out of here! - He's gonna get flushed! What a smart little guy! Oh, no! Not the trash can! Nemo! No! - Hey! I found his dad! - Where's Nemo? - Dentist! - He's over there! What's a dentist? Nigel, get in there! - I can't go in there! - Yes, you can! Charge! What the...? Darla, sweetie, look out! Hold still! Easy! Easy! Hold still! Nobody's going to hurt you! Oof! Nemo. Oh, my goodness. Gotcha! Keep down! Nemo! Daddy? Out with you! And stay out! Daddy? Fishy? Fishy! Wake up! Oh, no! To the top of Mount Wannahockaloogie! Why are you sleeping? - Hurry! - Bloat! Ring of Fire! Fishy! Crikey! All the animals have gone mad! Aaah! Get it out! - Smack her in the head! - Go, Gill, go! Fish in my hair! Gill! Sharkbait... tell your dad I said hi. Go get 'em! - He did it! - Yay! - I'm so happy! - Is he gonna be OK, Gill? Don't worry. All drains lead to the ocean. Fishy! Daddy! I'm so sorry. Truly, I am. Truly, I am. - Hey. - Dory... if it wasn't for you... I never would've even made it here. So, thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone, and I'm going home now. No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just... I remember things better with you. I do. Look... P. Sherman, 42... I remember it. I do. It's there. I know it is because when I look at you... I can feel it. I look at you and I... I'm home. Please... I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget. I'm sorry, Dory, but I do. - Manna from heaven. - Sweet nectar of life! Hey! Hey! Hey! - This is our spot! - Get outta here! Hey! Hey! Hey! Yeah, that's it, fella. Just keep on swimmin'. You got that. Too right, mate! Oh! I got a live one here! Have you seen my dad? Gotcha! Hey! Hey! Come back here! You let him go! Hey! Hey! Dad! Dad! Dad! Excuse me. Are you all right? I don't know where I am. I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody, but I can't remember. It's OK. I'm looking for someone, too. Hey, we can look together. I'm Dory. I'm Nemo. Nemo? That's a nice name. - Dad! - Dad! Wait a minute. Is it your dad or my dad? - My dad. - Got it. Dad! - Where are we, anyway? - Dad! Dad! Oh. Syl... Shi... Sydney. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Nemo! It's you! You're Nemo! Yes, yes, I'm Nemo! You're Nemo! You were dead. I saw you. And here you are! I found you. You're not dead. And your father... Your father! You know my father?! Where is he? This way! He went this way. Quick! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Have you seen an orange fish swim by? - It looks just like him! - But bigger! Yeah, I saw him, bluey. But I'm not tellin' you where he went... and there's no way you're gonna make me. Mine. All right! I'll talk! He went to the fishing grounds! Hey, look out! I'm sorry. I'm just trying to get home. Dad! Dad! Nemo? - Daddy! - Nemo? - Dad! - Nemo's alive! Dory? Nemo! Daddy! Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo! - Dad! - Nemo! Thank goodness. It's all right, son. It's gonna be OK. Turn around! You're going the wrong way! Look out! Oh, my... Help! He-e-elp! - Dory! - Come on! Help! Help! Help! Get us out! No, no, no! Dory! - Dad, I know what to do! - Nemo! No! We have to tell all the fish to swim down together! - Get out of there now! - I know this will work! No, I am not gonna lose you again! There's no time! It's the only way to save Dory! I can do this. You're right. I know you can. - Lucky fin! - Now, go! Hurry! Tell all the fish to swim down! Well? You heard my son! Come on! Dory, you have to tell everybody to... Swim down together! Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Swim down! Everybody swim down! Come on, you have to swim down! Down! Swim down! Swim down! Swim down! Don't give up! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming! That's it! It's working! Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming! Keep swimming! Come on, Dad! - You're doing great, son! - That's my dad. Let's get to the bottom! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming, just keep swimming Almost there! Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Keep swimming! - Oof! - Hey! - Dory! Where's Nemo? - There! Oh, no. Nemo! Nemo? Nemo? It's OK. Daddy's here. Daddy's got you. Daddy? Oh, thank goodness. Dad... I don't hate you. Oh, no, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo. - Hey, guess what? - What? Sea turtles... I met one. And he was 150 years old. - Yep. Sandy Plankton said they only live to be 100. Sandy Plankton? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean... and not know as much as Sandy Plankton? He was 150! Not 100! Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything? Time for school! Get up! Let's go! - I'm gonna win! - No, you're not! - I did it! - Aw, my own son beats me! Climb aboard, explorers. The sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says... ""With fronds like these, who needs anemones?"" Hello, Nemo. Who's this? - Exchange student. - I'm from the E.A.C., dude! - Sweet! - Totally. Seriously, Marty. Did you really do all the things you say you did? Pardon me. Hello. Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely. - Thanks, guys. - See you next week. - Keep up with the program. - Remember, fish are friends... Not food! Bye! Hold on, here we go! Next stop... knowledge! Bye, son! Have fun! Bye, Dad! Oh! Mr. Ray, wait. I forgot something. Love you, Dad. I love you, too, son. Dad? You can let go now. Sorry. Go have an adventure. Good-bye! See ya later, dudes! - Bye, Elmo! - Nemo. - Bye, Nemo! - See you after school, Dory! Bye, Dad! Bye, son. Barbara, I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee... and it breaks! I had to clean the tank myself, take all the fish out... put 'em in bags, and... Where'd the fish go? - Come on, Peach! - Hurry! - You can do it! - That's it. Just a little further. That's the shortest red light I've ever seen! Come on, Peach! Now what? Somewhere Beyond the sea Somewhere, waitin' for me My lover stands on golden sands And watches the ships That go sailin' Somewhere Beyond the sea She's there watchin' for me if I could fly like birds on high Then straight to her arms I'll go sailin' It's far Beyond the stars It's near, beyond the moon I know Beyond a doubt My heart Will lead me there soon We'll meet Beyond the shore We'll kiss just like before Happy we'll be beyond the sea And never again I'll go sailin' I know Beyond a doubt My heart Will lead me there soon Oh, we'll meet, I know we'll meet Beyond the shore We'll kiss just as before Happy we will be beyond the sea And never again I'll go sailin' No more sailin' So long, sailin', sailin' No more sailin' Good-bye, farewell, my friend No more sailin' So long Sailin' No more sailin' No more Farewell Auf wiedersehen Adieu to you and you No more sailin' No more No more sailin' No more, no more No more sailin' No more One more time No more sailin', Hi. - How'd it go? - Lousy. Got a '63 Thunderbird I would've sold in a day a year ago. Now they just wanna look at the pictures. You smell nice. How was your day? It was great. We had a big breakthrough in the Bulgari case. Really? We found a boot print. A really good one. The left heel was worn way down. That's a good lead. I know. We found a hair. A hair, wow. It's at the lab. So hopefully by noon tomorrow we'll find out his DNA... ...what kind of conditioner he uses, if he streaks his hair... ...if he has dandruff, everything. Isn't that amazing? That is amazing. You know, having those extra men really paid off. Oh, you're just being modest. Are you coming to bed, baby? I'm just gonna have a shower. Don't let me keep you up. - Good morning. - Good morning. - And you are Mr...? - Diaz. Miguel Diaz. - And you're here to open a...? - A SEP retirement account. Terrific. Oh, it says here you're already retired. - I am. - What was your occupation? I was a high school basketball coach. You must have done very well for yourself. - What's your name? - Greg. Greg. Let me ask you something. Do you have safe-deposit boxes here? Yes, they're housed in our vault. - New vault? - It's over 100 years old. Of course, we've made some state-of-the-art upgrades since then. You know, I was once in a vault while it was being robbed. That must have been quite an experience. Yeah. Yeah. That's too oxblood. What do y'all do? My husband and I? Well, he's retired. Just retired. It's great. It's... And I did work at an art gallery. And, you know, I love art, obviously, and paint and... That's too brown. I'm sorry. Do you mind if I...? - Hey, it's your paint. - Okay. Thank you. May I show you something specific? Well, I was looking for something for my wife. What is it, a special occasion? It's our second third anniversary. Excuse me. Hello, Mrs. Diaz, we were just talking about you. - How'd it go at the bank? - It was easy. I mean great. No, you mean easy. What? You're doing recon work on our anniversary? - Tess. - Let me ask you this: - Where are you now? - Casing a jewelry store. That's an interesting way to ease back into society, which was your idea. - Should I stop painting now? - Listen. Let's talk about something important. I can't find a restaurant for tonight. - Well, we'll stay in. - Really? - Great. I'll cook. - No, I'll cook. You talk. You want me to talk? Words and everything? That's what they make flowers for, you know. - Oh, no, Danny. - What is it? Tess... ...what's wrong? There's water in the basement and the pilot light is out. Hang up! Hello, Tess. Where is he, Tess? Where is... ...Mr. Diaz? I want it back, Tess. I want it all back. You got it all... ...from the insurance company. - I want my money back. The money that your husband and his 10 friends stole from me. With interest. A hundred and sixty million dollars over three years. That's a lot of vig. And I want it all back. He's got two weeks. You'll never find them. They're way too smart for you. Right. You know, as it turns out... ...I'm not the only person in the world looking for Ocean's 11. All right. I'm the groom, and I'm not supposed to say anything, but... Make a speech. But I don't care what the rules are, because I really wanna thank my family. My mom and dad, my Uncle Gary and Aunt Grace. Uncle Ted, Aunt Celeste... ...and their children, Denise and Jessica. Bishop Tom and his wife, Helen, my neighbor John... ...and his new girlfriend, Tanya. And all the guys at Lean Machine Inc, Bobo, Mullethead... ...Big Sam. And everyone else who's just been great... ...in welcoming Sara into the family. Thank you. Excuse me, everybody. I'd just like to... - Get up. - Get up. - Get up. - Get up. Get up. - Walk. - Walk. I'd like to say a few words about commitment... ...about honor... ...about responsibility... ...about a very special someone and admitting to her... Get up. Pull the chair out. Admitting to her in front of everybody... ...that her wedding... ...and that very special honeymoon trip to Epcot Center... ...will have to be postponed. The photographer. He's just a friend. You met him at The Mint, remember? Well, of course I am. You don't expect me to embarrass myself by flying commercial? On a budget? On a budget? Who was the only person who couldn't get in on the Chinese cell-phone market? You, with all your connections. What was that? He seemed really nice. And you know it's hard for guys to be friends with me. And you do this every time that I meet someone new. And you know what? It's getting really boring. You think it's a accident no one know about Fred ""Bud"" Kelly? Ain't no accident. There's one explanation... ...and you ladies know exactly what it is. I'm gonna tell you what it is. Conspiracy, collusion, complicity. That's all it is. Let me break it down like a fraction for you about my man Fred ""Bud"" Kelly. Fred ""Bud"" Kelly made skates out of whiskey bottles... ...at his uncle's farm in the early 1900s. That was over there in Nova Scotia. I'm gonna tell you something else. You never seen his name on the Stanley Cup. You know why that is? Because that son of a bitch Jim Crow... ...took his name off the history books. You kind of... Seems like every time I see you, you're playing the race card, Frank. Now, why is that? You can let go of my feet now. - This don't bother you? - Of course it ******* bothers me, mate. - What the **** do you want me to do? - Well, it's ****** up. You can't hear none of the lyrics. You can't get with the beat with all them ******* bleeps in it. You want a ******* single on the ******* radio... ...it's what you have to ******* do. Well, it's ******, isn't it? Totally ******! ******* right, it's *************. What the **** is that? Somebody must be in 2. Oh, ****! And you haven't contacted my father about any of this? Because, really, I don't think there's any reason to involve him or my mom. It's all on you, Linus. Okay. Good. - Good. Because I have a whole network... - Get out of my car. Thank you. - Mr. Bloom? - Yes. There appears to be a slight problem with your card. Oh, well, yes. Here. I'm afraid not, sir. Why? Your business manager said you would understand. Todd said I would understand? No, Mr. Benedict. Mr. Benedict. Mr... Oh, yes. An old friend, a practical joker. Tell Mr. Benedict he's won this round, yes. Terry Benedict. Old Terry. She's looking at me from across the room. And she's crazy about me, I can tell... ...because she's been staring at me all night. So suddenly... ...I just go up to her, and I grab her. And I've got her really close to me... ...and her eyes are all fiery. And my eyes are fiery. And it's like... It's electric. And I say to her, ""Mom... Mother... "" What? Thanks for letting me finish. What can I say? You're a funny guy. Oh, yeah. My friend Rusty. I'm worried about him. He owns this hotel in Los Angeles... ...losing a lot of money, and he's got no life. He's a nice, bright kid, but he's beating his brains out. Do you think I could send something through you, like, a message to him? I read your palm, not his. Somebody who could do that could do very well. Anything on my health? - My hips are bothering me. - Please. This? You couldn't see this? - I tried knocking, he won't open. - I'll handle it. I know him. Jesus Christ, are you people retarded? - It says, ""Do not disturb""! - It's me. Hey. Come on in. Jeez, Topher, you didn't have to go all Frankie Muniz on me. I'm sorry. Rust, look, I know this is your joint. I just... There's this girl. I love her, man. I love her, but she is driving me crazy! I can't sleep. I can't work. I quit the show. I totally phoned in that Dennis Quaid movie. - I mean, it's like... - Hello? God, it's almost like this Kabbalah crap doesn't even work! Rusty, call for you. Dude, don't leave. - Yeah? - I have a message... ...for Robert Charles Ryan, soon to be ex-owner of the Standard Hotel. - You got him. - Last time we spoke, you hung up on me. You used some nasty words. I got sensitive ears. I admit I was a little emotional that evening. Think about that night a lot, don't you? I thought I'd be dead before I heard the sound that killed me. I've been asked to show restraint. Otherwise, you would've gone out... ...to your favorite car of all the 17 you own... ...and as soon as you turned on the ignition... You got two weeks. Now, you told me that your wife said that he called it Ocean's 11. Now, who decided that? I'm a private contractor. It was a collaboration. That moniker is insulting. It was one job we did together. I don't know where this proprietary stance comes from. It seems possessive. One could argue that because it was Danny's idea... Hang on a minute. We all had our own areas of expertise. I mean, without us, it don't leave your head, mate. It just hurts, you know, because... ...it seemed we all agreed to call it ""the Benedict job. "" That's what we called it when we were doing it. If you wanted to call it something else... When you have a problem, who do you go to? - Rusty. - Rusty. Thanks. Let's get back on the topic. Based on what we stole, plus interest... ...how much does everybody owe? - $17.34 million. Assuming Benedict gives us prime plus one, which I doubt. Figure 19 to be safe. Okay, 19 each. Anybody got that? What, you think the stock market's some great mystery... ...beyond the realm of human understanding? Didn't you see the signs? I saw the signs. How much is everybody short? How much you short? Fourteen. Fourteen. - All but 5 million? - Yeah. You gonna start with me? You don't know what it's like to create something from scratch. - Well, with interest, I'm short 7. - Eight. I spent about a million, mostly on talent development. That makes it 7 for me. Boy, the interest just kills you. - I'm light 9. - What's the interest? - About 6. - Then I owe 6. - How? - What? I've been staying at my parents'. I owe 25. Hotels, man. Saul? I haven't spent it all, but I will. I'm out, fellas. As ranking old-timer, I gotta say, I just can't do it. At my age, I think I earned the right to be selfish. I wanna thank you all for the wonderful opportunity. You're all aces in my book. But I want the last check I write to bounce. Saul, you having a laugh? Saul. - I can handle Saul's share. - You don't have to. Who would I talk to if you were all dead? That's a good point. All right, I owe 10. Amazing? Yeah, but it's a nice place. - So that comes to...? - Ninety-seven, give or take. He didn't find us on his own. - Someone helped him. - Another thief. Nobody we know would violate rule number one. What we do know is we need a job. We need a high-paying job. We're too hot to work anywhere in this country. - So we go abroad. How about we go...? - We're on the 5:00. Good. Where are we going? - Amsterdam. - Amsterdam it is. - Clock's running. Let's go. - Never been to Amsterdam. I hear German girls are really hot. Rusty. - Amsterdam? - Yeah. Don't tell Danny. Hey, Rusty. Rusty. Sorry, sorry. Hey. What are you doing? What's wrong with you? - Nothing. - What? - Can I...? Can I...? - What? - Just for a second, can I talk to you? - What's wrong? I just... I don't know. This might not be the perfect time or whatever to talk about it. - Okay. - I've been thinking. I've been doing my homework. And I'd really like... ...to play a more central role this time around. - Right. - I feel like I've... - Right. - I'm ready for that, and I... Way overdue. I was wondering if I could come to the meeting and help you guys negotiate. Okay. It's just a sit-down with Matsui. He's got his own language, this guy. I watched you and Danny really closely last time around. I learned a ton. Linus, in my professional opinion, you're not ready. - Okay. Yeah, I mean... - But... But... But... ...if you're convinced you are ready... ...I can speak with Danny. We can make this happen. But you gotta be sure. - Not sure? - No, I am. - You're sure? - But if I had a question, I could... - You would call me? - Right. Okay. Any time. - Okay. - Okay. - All right. - Okay. Awesome. Thank you. Yeah. I almost wasn't gonna come over and say anything. Then I'd still be sleeping. - Thanks, buddy. - Yeah. - Who's there? - Li... It's... - What? - It's Linus. Is Rusty here? Rusty...? - Do you know where Rusty is? - No. So have you met Matsui? Seriously, what do you think of me... ...you know, in terms of just leadership potential? The fact that we're unemployable shouldn't enter your mind. Otherwise, you're wasting time. Don't mention Benedict unless he does first. And if he does, tell him everything. Right. Stay on point. And don't forget the other thing I told you. - What? - About listening. Relax. Remember, if we don't get this job, we're dead. Rusty, I tried calling you all yesterday. So finally, she slams her vodka tonic down on the tray and says: ""Hey, maybe that's why I've been feeling so warm recently. "" Yeah. - So to business? - To business. A doctor who specializes in skin diseases... ...will dream he has fallen asleep in front of the television. Later, he will wake up in front of the television... ...but not remember his dream. Would you agree? If all the animals along the equator were capable of flattery... ...then Thanksgiving and Halloween... ...would fall on the same date. Yeah. Hey. When I was 4 years old... ...I watched my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy. Years later, I realized it was not a spider. It was my Uncle Harold. Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face Stars to fill my dreams I am a traveler in both time and space To be where I have been Is he all right? Are we all right? - ""Kashmir""? - Is that your idea of a contribution? - We hadn't even started yet. - We were this close to losing that. Okay, I don't even understand what happened in there. What did I say? - You called his niece a whore. - A cheap one. - She's 7. - Confined to bed with a case of... - No, don't tell him about it. - I'm sorry. Okay. So, what does this mean? It means you stay here. The mark's name is van der Woude. A semi-known, wealthy recluse. He claims to sell antiques, but hasn't actually sold one. His store is his privately owned home, which no one ever enters. But don't let van der Woude's eccentricity fool you. The house is extremely well-protected. - What are we after? - It's a document. It's a very old, very valuable document. - Yeah, what is it? - A stock certificate. The first one ever issued from the first corporation on the planet. Dutch East India Trading Company. - The only one of its kind. - What's the take? 2.5 million euro. Wait. Each? - No. - Who negotiated this? - That's a lot of money to a lot of people. - Are you out of your mind? If we do one job a week at that rate, we won't pay Benedict off until... - September 2005. - Jesus Christ, Danny. I hear you, but it's what's available. After we pull this job off... ...Matsui's gonna throw us another. It's gonna pay 10 times this one. - Which buys an extension from Benedict. - You hope. I hope. Now, the good news is that Matsui gave us the system's master code. - So, what are we waiting for? - Van der Woude. - That's the bad news. - He never leaves. - He's agoraphobic. - He's never been out of his house? - Not in 10 years since he moved in. - Does he believe in fresh air? - He opens his window. - What does that mean? - Best time of arrival. - Means he opens his window. Every night at 1:30 he takes an Ambien, puts on Beethoven's Third. By the fourth movement, he's out like a light. So we go in at 3 a. m. Okay, can we tap into the system from the phone lines? It's a closed-loop system with two servers locked in titanium cases next to his bed. - So hacking in is out. - Look at this. Telephone-repair truck, basket up to the second floor. Telescoping rod through the window, tap out the freak's code. - Dumb idea. One lane, one-way streets. - Dumb idea. All right? Any stoppage will bring cops. The outside is covered by five surveillance cameras. Monitored 24 hours a day by a security company. He's got five exterior cameras? - This guy is a freak. - Super freak. What about through the roof? - Two more cameras, pressure sensors... - A laser net over the trap door... - Smoke the freak out. - Yeah. - Smoke the freak out. - Hey! - What? - Do we have to use that term? - What term? - ""Freak. "" The National Institute of Mental Health estimates 5.6 percent of adults... ...develop ""agraphoriaphobia. "" - Agoraphobia. Whatever. I'm just saying, I mean, do we...? We don't need to be an organization that labels people. Oh, now we're an organization? You'd call Emily Dickinson a freak? - Are you hosting a telethon? - Who's Emily Dickinson? Am I the only one who feels funny about stealing from a...? You know, a handicapped guy? - Well, I don't care. - Hell, yeah. I feel funny about other things. Cool. But... - Yeah? - But... - Right. - What? - Ahab with a piggyback. Livingston? - I can get anything. - It's done. - Ahab with what? - Boys. - You're making that up. That's... That whole ""Ahab with a piggyback,"" that's not real? - Let me in. - How do you think it feels... ...when someone bangs on the door? - I gotta go to the toilet. Otherwise, I'm gonna shit on your feet. Come on. Show me them specs. I've been doing this since I'm 12 years old. You're micromanaging. You gotta find people you can delegate to. Otherwise, you'll never have a life. I don't want a life. I want the hotel to run like a hotel should. Reuben. Yeah. Great. - Okay. Good. - Maybe. Fantastic. Remember in Miller's Crossing where Turturro begs for his life? Sure. ""Look into your heart. "" I cry every time. What? We have no line of sight. Our only possibility, the window. We're three inches too high. There's no clear shot, even with Basher. In the physical universe we occupy, it cannot be done. What about the guy from the Bulgari job? - Nagel. Spoke with him. - Anything? Lot of ideas, none of them any good. He's pushing this new holographic technology. Really interesting stuff, though. He can reproduce anything 3-D. How about 97 million? We're forcing it. Yeah, we're forcing it. - You know what we haven't thought of? - What? We turn ourselves in. - What could Benedict do to us then? - There you go. Call the cops, tell them we did the Bellagio job. They put us away for 20 years. That'd teach him. I think Tess would stick around. You look great in jumpsuits. Hey... ...how's the hotel business? - Sucks. - How's East Haven? - Sucks. I don't know. Can't turn my brain off, you know. It's me. We go into some place, and all I can do is see the angles. It's what I do. It's what I've always done. I love it. I don't know. Some sort of weird irony, you know? Tess watching me scratch and itch. Hey, listen. You know, the world's gone nuts and you're... - What'd you wanna do? - It's not attached... ...to the adjacent buildings. - The whole house? - We're just raising it slightly. Schumann did it in '64 in Venice and '73 in Istanbul. - He only had a crew of six. - We can't tilt a house. - Did it with the Leaning Tower of Pizza. - Exactly, thank you. - It took 300 men over two years to do it. - There's 30 pylons. We cut them, insert the jacks and crank away. It's really our best plan, considering it's our only plan. - Crank for how long? - Like I said, it's our only plan. What? Oh, oh, okay, hold on. Try that. Number five. I'm a go. Master thieves who practice the long con live separate lives as civilians. They have legitimate jobs and families... ...which make them extremely difficult to catch. The greatest thief of all time was, without question... ...Gaspar LeMarc, who either died in Portugal in 1988... ...or in Hong Kong in 1996, or he's still alive. We may never know for certain because LeMarc... ...was never captured or photographed... ...despite being active for over 50 years. Though he left behind a slew of imitators... ...only one is worth mentioning in the same breath as LeMarc: The thief we know only as the Night Fox. So named for the small onyx figurines he leaves behind to taunt us... ...the Night Fox must be considered our number-one priority. His string of high-profile crimes are an embarrassment to our branch... ...to our entire profession. We need more than traditional resources to pursue thieves like the Night Fox. We need to train ourselves to think the way they think, to see what they see. And we should not allow ourselves to be distracted... What? Hi, Isabel. Well, we could really use your help on this one. I hope the scene hasn't been contaminated. When can I speak to Mr. van der Woude? Probably tomorrow. He's heavily sedated. We can't figure out how they disabled the alarm. Shorted it out somehow? No, that would have triggered the system and damaged the circuits. Well, then. Then I don't know how they got in. They had the code. Someone other than the owner must have known it. Impossible. Van der Woude programmed the last nine steps of the system. He set it and never left the house again. Closed loop. Redundant servers. Titanium encasement. It's not bad, actually. Yeah. Thanks. Do we know each other? - I think I saw you yesterday. - Oh, yeah? Yeah, you were being chased by the police. Chasing me? No. I don't think so. I'm quite sure it was you. Doesn't say much for the police. No, I love Rome. I love it. But there's an opening at work the level above me, and it's... I was thinking I was gonna try out for it. It's in Amsterdam. My mother has family there, so it'd be... It'd be good. - He lifted the whole house? - The whole house. - The entire house? - The entire house. It's called a Schumann Special... ...named after this guy, a brilliant guy, Max Schumann. Then he did it in Istanbul in 1973. What is it? It's where the crossbow bolt hit. The crossbow bolt? They fired from that rooftop through this open window. With a crossbow bolt from that roof through that window? - That's a very difficult shot. - No, it is an impossible shot... ...until they raised the building. Check the pylons. They'll be elevated. - You know the name Max Schumann? - No. - Well, they do. - Who? The Americans. Wait a minute. Exactly. Why would they bring the drill if they weren't planning to use it? - What? - Oh, God. - What? - I don't know. Congratulations. You are the second person to crack the van der Woude safe tonight. In arriving second, Mr. Ocean, you have joined a long line... ...of people who've worked hard and risked a great deal... ...only to get somewhere second. You don't know these people by name, of course, because they enter oblivion. You know this word, ""oblivion""? It means to be totally forgotten by everyone forever. And it's where you would be now if it weren't for the Bellagio heist. How does this guy know who we are? In a way, I'm responsible for you coming to Amsterdam in the first place. I hired Matsui, and Matsui hired you. That's the guy who dimed us to Benedict. - All of them, including Ocean. - Yes. I find that hard to believe. And you are? You can call me the Night Fox. The Night Fox. Okay, Mr. Night Fox. - What will this information cost me? - Don't worry. Nothing. Nothing? Who do you think you're dealing with? Nothing costs nothing. And this information is definitely worth something. Let's just say our interests are temporarily aligned. How so? Well, the information is free, but it comes with certain conditions. - Such as? - Restraint on your part. Restraint? That's asking a lot. What else? Two weeks to buy themselves out of trouble. Two weeks? I can live with that, even if they can't. Just out of curiosity, what will you make them pay? For letting them live? Everything they stole, plus interest. A lot of interest. But didn't your insurance cover what was stolen? Of course. So you're asking them to double your money? Well, do you really think that's fair? Fair? I certainly hope not. So, what about the information? Okay. It's on your desk. He was here. Around 3:30 this morning. I can tell. - Who? - The Night Fox. Go down to the Dampkring and pick up a guy called Matsui. Real name, Ian Nicolas McNally. The Night Fox was here at the same time as the Americans? Why? That's what we're gonna find out. What is he doing? Get him out of there. God. Hello, Frank. I can't understand what we did to this guy. - Why does he have it out for us like this? - How did he get that code? Doesn't matter. He broke rule number one. He's on the list. Great time for a turf war. I spoke with Frank's associate in Dublin. She's trying to get us a name on this guy. Our train leaves tomorrow at 1:38, okay? - Where is Frank? - I don't know. It's gonna get out. Then we'll be dead, and no one will wanna work with us. Housekeeping. Turndown service for Mr. Ryan. Hi. Nice room. You have it all to yourself? You here to take me in? Why would I do that? It's not as if you stole something. It's nice to see you again, Robert. You too. Of course, you've been seeing plenty of me, haven't you? I like this one. I call it ""thief  la mode. "" Schumann Special, huh? I guess that's what I get for opening my mouth. So, what about the Night Fox? Did he leave you a message? What about the figurine? You still have it? I suppose it's a compliment in a way. I guess he's threatened by you, though I can't imagine why. You have no idea what you're up against. The French police think he's better than LeMarc. Well, he is French. Let me give you some advice. Find out how you offended him. Apologize. Beg for mercy. Got to go. Any message for Frank? He's been hanging around the station. On what charge? Well, we found a print of a size 14 Hi-Tec Magnum boot at the crime scene. And? Bought with a fraudulent credit card. From that point on, well, there's only one... ...maybe two great nail salons in Amsterdam. - And you lied to us. - Yeah, and to me. Well, Frank knew. - Frank knew you were in touch? - I wasn't in touch. I was more like keeping tabs. - She's a cop! - Detective, actually. - Where'd she learn all the Schumann crap? - Dad. - What, he was a cop? - Thief. - Oh, God. Was he good? - Oh, yeah. Great. Pissed-off ex-girlfriend whose thief father... ...taught her every trick in the book. Well, she just made Danny and Yen. In the next 48 hours, your pictures will be in every police station. - Nobody looks at them. - Nobody but cops. - Detectives. - You'd think she'd have sympathy... ...for us if her old man was a thief. - Is that sympathy or empathy? No, her old man got popped a day before her 9th birthday. Died in jail. So I wouldn't count on much sympathy. Or empathy. She's gonna have the hotel under surveillance. Great. We'll just eat room service, watch movies and wait for Benedict to kill us. - Who's on the $100 bill? - Adams. - John Travolta. - He said every problem... ...is an opportunity in disguise. He couldn't say that with a .45 in his mouth. No, you're missing the silver lining here. Now, she gave us a name, didn't she? The Night Fox. One phone call, we'll find out everything there is to know about this guy. The name is M. Diaz. D-I-A-Z. It's a black duffel bag. The team's in Rotterdam. The bag's in Brussels. He's the modern man: disconnected, frightened... ...paranoid, but with good reason. It's too sad to be funny. Unusable. - I think I can get 20 minutes out of it. - Great. I got it. The team's in Barcelona. The bag's in Madrid. This is a moral issue we're dealing with here. And we don't have a grease man anymore because he's in a bag somewhere. We got a bag man. Such an ape. An animal with no feelings. - I have feelings. - No, you don't. I feel bad for the guy. He's in a piece of luggage, but he's got water. - What did you want them to do? - Get off the bus. And pick up the bag with our friend in it. How many pro soccer teams are fielding 50-year-old men? Rusty's not 50 years old. Yeah, dude, we know Rusty's not 50. You think I'm 50 years old? Let me ask you something. No, wait, let me ask you something. How old do you think I am? Forty-eight. You think I'm 48 years old? Fifty-two? - Maybe he should've asked me. - Nobody should ever ask you anything. That guy doesn't have a hard enough life right now? You gotta... You're gonna defend him? They put Yen in a handbag. - Can I ask you something? Ever notice...? - If you're gonna ask a question... ...give me time to respond, unless it's rhetorical... ...in which case the answer is obvious: yes. - Okay, can I ask...? - Yes. - You ever notice that Tess looks exactly... - Don't ever ask that. Seriously. - Not to anyone. Especially not to her. - Wait. Why not? Look. It's not in my nature to be mysterious... ...but I can't talk about it, and I can't talk about why. - Can I ask you...? Do I look 50 to you? - Yeah. - Really? - Well, I mean, only from the neck up. Saul? What's the matter? Nothing. You wanna go out? It's nice. No. You wanna watch something? The game's on. No. - You hungry? I'll heat something up. - No. Saul, ever since you got back, you've been acting strange. What did Danny want? Nothing. Nothing? How could he want nothing? All right, the Night Fox has a name. Francois Toulour. Baron Francois Toulour. Father was a French industrialist, mother was Italian nobility. He never met her, but he inherited her title. The bad news is he's rich, he's bored and he's talented. The really bad news is he was trained by LeMarc. - This is not good. - With the LeMarc? Gaspar LeMarc? That's the one. - Well, we're doomed. - We're not doomed. - He's one guy, and he's French. - Yeah. Before we get too impressed by his background... ...let's hear what he's done. - He started in the '90s. Bank of Geneva, the Danish Treasury, the Bank of Italy, AMC Amro... ...the Brussels Diamond Exchange, Antwerp Diamond Exchange. - Wait, wait. All those in the 1990s? - I'm only up to '96. - Seriously? - In '97, he went through an art phase. He hit the Tate in London, the Louvre in Paris, twice, and the Prado. Wait. No, no, hang on. The Prado Museum in '97? That was Moretti. - Everybody knows that... - He is Moretti. It's one of his aliases. Okay, I'll skip to my favorite. In 2002, he stole the king of Morocco's 200-foot yacht. Vanished into thin air. Crew surfaced days later in a life raft. Couldn't remember a thing. - How do you hide a 200-foot yacht? - If the king knows, he's not telling. He got it back a month later. He now plays tennis with Toulour every weekend. - We're in some serious trouble here. - Copy that. - So, what do we do? - We respond. - Respond? How? - In kind. Mr. Ocean. You broke rule number one, and that has consequences. Oh, you must be talking about the paintings. Don't worry. You'll be dead in five days, and I'll get my paintings back. - Unless you have an accident first. - I don't think so, Daniel. Perhaps I should explain to you why I'm tormenting you. I'd like that. Last month I was in Portugal to see my mentor. - LeMarc. - Indeed. A very loud and annoying American businessman was there the same day. He worked for a big insurance company. He's the one who suggested Benedict to you as a potential mark. - You know the man? - What about him? He said it was the most beautiful job he'd ever seen. He went on and on about this job, and then he said... ...it showed you were the greatest thief in the world. But the worst part is that LeMarc never corrected him. I told LeMarc that you can't be better than me. And he answered that it was impossible to know for sure. So I thought about that for, like, three weeks in a row, day and night. And then suddenly, I realized that he was actually right. It is impossible to compare one theft to the other. So I guess the only way to know who's the best of us for sure... ...is to go after the same object. Do the same job. Don't you think that would be fun? You're being awfully cavalier with a lot of people's lives so you can play out a game. You're gonna regret it. Come on, Mr. Ocean. How are you gonna possibly get $97 million by next Wednesday? Especially if every safe you crack between now and then is already empty? Whereas if you accept my challenge and win... ...I promise I'll pay your debt to Benedict... ...and LeMarc will hold my money in escrow as a guarantee. What are we stealing? The famous Faberg Coronation Egg. - Was that your idea or LeMarc's? - I think he would agree... ...that it's the most appropriate thing for us to compete over. Where is it located? The egg left Paris this morning on its way to Rome. It travels with heavy security and usually with one or more replicas. Sometimes they even show the replicas without anybody knowing. When the egg goes on display Monday morning... ...you'll have 48 hours to steal it before your deadline's up. When the deadline passes and you don't have the egg... ...LeMarc will know who's the best. - Rusty's phone. - Who is this? Nicole. Who's this? Nagel. Where's Rusty? He said if you called, to say he was at Gunther's. Gunther's? What's that about? Did he say something? Do you have a message? Yes, I do. Tell him this thing is gonna cost him double what I told him. And tell him I had to go three times as thin on the layers. And tell him if he wants it tomorrow, it should cost him more than double. And tell him this thing is beautiful. Would fool the bloody Romanovs themselves. And tell him I'm being a nice guy. And tell him he dresses like a gigolo. Is that it? Yeah. No. Tell him having a sexy female assistant... ...is such a terrible clich. Can I get a coffee or something? Thanks. Just a cappuccino or espresso. Well... You call me on Saturday and ask me to come into my office... ...and sign a 1077... ...and you can't even tell me what they are after? - I can come to your house. - I'm leaving for Naples in two hours. - We'll talk about this on Wednesday. - It'll be gone by Wednesday. - What? What? What will be gone? - Something worth signing a 1077 for. Ryan and his friends did the Bellagio casino heist in 2001. - I am telling you, this is serious... - If that's true... ...then we should call the American FBl... - No, no, no. - Maurizio, listen to me. - Agent Lahiri... ...a 1077 is not a small thing. Unless you can tell me what they are after... ...there is no point in discussing it. Hey... Because LeMarc stole it in 1980 when 23 others failed. Because the Night Fox is trying to prove he's better than Ryan and his friends. This is ridiculous. You say the egg will be stolen. Then you say LeMarc already stole it 24 years ago. - Which one is it? - Both. What? LeMarc's wife made him put the egg back. When I signed a 1077 for you on the Bulgari case... ...you requisitioned 30 of my men for three months and made zero arrests. I won't do it again. First, we cannot go at night. The laser grid in the Great Hall's impossible to beat. - Nothing's impossible. - This is impossible. It's in constant motion, programmed to improvise randomly... ...meaning we can't plan our way through. All right. So it's a daytime play. We're still short three on the inside since Isabel made you and Yen and Danny. We could try a Smuggler's Paradise. - It hasn't worked since the '50s. - '54, actually. What's option two? Baby Jane, Squeaky Wheel, followed by a Number-Two Son. It's complicated, but it's got a high success rate. The only problem is... We can't do it without a grease man on the inside, without Yen. We'll have to risk it. We'll put him in disguise. proceed west. 10:11? - I enter the second-floor bathroom. Approach the Spanish Steps from the south. Basher and I enter by the main entrance. - I help Yen into the ventilation duct. - I move Reuben to the Egg Room. - I pause in the Great Hall while... - I go to the Egg Room. - Yen enters the mainframe room. He cuts power to grid 14-A. He radios me. I signal Linus. - I then go to the Egg Room. I drop my keys and move Reuben to his mark. - I blind camera one. - I blind camera two. - I blind camera three. - I blind camera four. - I make the switch. - Right. - I pull to the corner of the main entrance. I meet Danny at the Steps. We head north. 10:25? Turk and I make the drop. All right. Really good stuff, guys. Really good work. All right, we'll pick it up here in an hour. It's a slam-dunk. - Great. - 10:45, we all get arrested. You bet. - How was Toulour? - He was predictable. You hear from Nagel? He'll be here. That's a lot to presume from a guy like Nagel. Follow it up. This is Isabel. It's Johan. I just set a 6:00 meeting for you with an Andre Ciment... ...who says he had four paintings stolen from his house in Lake Como. - And when was this? - Sometime Friday. He's missing two Monets, a Turner and a Degas. - Which Degas was it? - Blue Dancers. Supposedly, there's surveillance video, but I haven't been able to confirm that yet. It is all about error correction. Three thousand separate, translucent, digital slivers... ...instead of the 1000 I thought it would be. Thank God it doesn't have to move. Re-creating the lighting was a pain. It's a mixture of tungsten and real light. But I think the color rendition is pretty damn accurate. Batteries are in the base. Two minutes maximum. You're good. - It's good, Roman. You're a genius. - I think I am. You'd have never got past that grid. That's why you're paying me double. - What? No, no, no. - You got my message. - Who's that sexy phone voice? Early Bond. - What message? The message I left with Sexy Phone Voice Nicole. On your mobile. Got something going with Gunther? Am I in? - Okay, when did you leave the message? - Two days ago. She had your phone. - She has your...? - Yeah. - That means that she's...? - Yeah. - Well, you better... - Yeah. - That's great. - I mean... So...? So who's got my money? Who has got my bloody money? Jesus. Sorry to hear about your mom. She was an amazing... Well, I thought so, at least. She hated you. I should've picked up on that. - She hated all thieves. - No wonder you fought. Excuse me? - May I have my phone back? - No. - That's a nice pull, by the way. - Thanks. Did you get that tingling sensation down your spine when you did it? Or is that none of my business? You considered a career change? Have you? I tried hotels. I'm better at this. Went by the caf for some tiramisu. - It wasn't the same. - Who's the Night Fox? - They did something to the eggs. - Why accept his challenge? Because he'll lose. And how can you beat him? We can't. You're not making any sense. Okay. The Bulgari job you pulled with Frank when we were together... ...I knew it was you. Why didn't you say something? Why didn't you... ...Robert? I didn't want it to end. You assumed it would. Was I wrong? You shouldn't be here. I have a meeting. Someone stole a whole bunch of paintings in Lake Como. Interesting. Any leads? The next time I see you... ...I'm arresting you. And Ocean and anybody else I recognize. Fair enough. - Ready? - Right. Yes, of course I do. My Blue Dancers, my Degas. They took it, unfortunately, and I really would like... Do you have any enemies? Anybody out there who would feel wronged by you? No. I can't see anyone. But why? You think... You think maybe the thief... ...is trying to harm me personally now? Well, I assumed he was after the paintings themselves. I think it's enough. Ready? Good? I have something you might be interested in. It's a DVD with all the hidden surveillance cameras I have to my place. It's plenty. I haven't checked it out yet. Maybe the thieves have been careless enough to be photographed. I doubt it, this level of thief, but I'll take a look. Yeah. You never know. Okay. Well, merci. Thank you, Mademoiselle Lahiri, for everything. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Mademoiselle Lahiri. Did you get the faxed copy of the 1077? Good. Here's what I need: A dozen... Twelve uniformed officers. Metal detectors, extra cameras. So I'll e-mail you the photographs. Do you happen to have a pen? I'll just give you the names. Okay. Livingston Dell, male, Caucasian, 5'6"", 150 pounds. Virgil Malloy, male, Caucasian, 5' 10"", 160 pounds. Robert Ryan, male, Caucasian... - Hello? - Buon giorno, Mr. Eisenhower. This is your 5 a.m. wake-up call. - Really? - Yes, I'm afraid. Have a nice day, sir. - Hey. - What are you doing? - What...? Sleeping. Why are you dressed? - It's 5:30, day of. We gotta go. Let's go. It's 11:30. The night before. But... Oh, he's mean. He's just mean-spirited. - How many espressos did you have? - Five. Yeah, come on. I don't know if she's just confused... ...or she's really turned the corner and hates me now. You think I handled this wrong? I was too forceful. I was too American. She's different. Maybe you're right, maybe she has moved on. You know, I talked to a doctor about getting that tattoo removed. But given its location, he advised against it. That guy doing Potsie is unbelievable. I mean, what's this guy's problem? He's stitched us up twice in two weeks, all over his ego. It's the first decent evening we've had together in I don't know how long. All right, all right, let's just stay on point here. Let's go over the list again. Who died and made you Danny? No one. I'm sorry. My emotions are all over the place. I was forceful, trying to show good leadership... - For fuck's sake. Let's go. - You're a good leader. Thanks. All right, well, let's go over the list again. - Swinging Priest? - Not enough people. - Crazy Larry? - Not enough people. - Soft Shoulder? - Not enough people. - Baker's Dozen? - No woman and not enough people. Hell in a Handbasket? We can't train a cat that quickly. And not enough people. - What about Tess? - What about her? Well, you know how she kind of looks like... - So what? - Yeah, what's your point? So we do a Lookie-loo. - It's a Lookie-loo with a Bundle of Joy. - A Lookie-loo with Tess... ...and a Bundle of Joy? You've gone right out of your tree, my son. He's mad. It's crazy. It's Italian-television crazy, and we're still one short. Think about it. She can get near the egg... ...during daylight with half the system down. I mean, that's a trifecta. He might be right. Make the calls. Linus Caldwell, you are not following the procedures... ...Danny talked about if Terry Benedict shows up. Something is wrong. What is wrong? Danny's fine. He's with Rusty. During this part of the plan, they can't communicate with us. Promise he isn't hurt. I promise he isn't hurt. You're gonna miss the deadline. Danny would be thrilled if you met him in Rome when the job's finished. He misses you like crazy. Plus, you studied art, so I know how much you love Rome. There's no downside here. Wow, they're bringing you along fast, aren't they? Yes. Danny would be more thrilled... ...if you were on the 7 p.m. out of JFK, which means you have to leave right now. I thought I'd requested a midsize. - Danny here? - He wanted to be. Did you have a nice flight? We weren't sure if you were a window or aisle person. - How long's Danny been in jail? - Just a couple of days, really. Which, you know, on the bright side, he's completely safe from Benedict. He told me everything was fine. He lied right to me. What I think he meant by ""fine"" is we're running low on time and money... ...and we're deeper in debt than when we started. I assume that you have a plan to get him out. - Actually, she sounds like her. - No, she needs a Southern accent. - Can you do a Southern...? - What the hell is going on with you guys? Not quite. The accent is crucial. It's the first thing people notice. - This ridiculous car, what is it doing? - Okay, I'm sorry. All right, I'm just gonna level with you. Due to certain personnel losses... ...that we have sustained... ...we're... Various readjustments had to be made. You're gonna have to play a small role in this thing. Okay? So can you put these on? I'd like you to put this hat on. You're gonna put on that, and you're gonna stuff it with that. And we'll turn around, just give you a little moment. Small role. Who am I supposed to be? Well... Oh, really? Well, absolutely. I can have... We can make the suite available. No, no, no trouble at all. I mean, we would love... We are honored that she would think of us again. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Bye. How is this going to get Danny out? - We needed someone famous. - Why didn't you get someone famous? Just think Four Weddings and a Funeral. She wasn't in Four Weddings and a Funeral. ""I. "" ""I wasn't in Four Weddings and a Funeral. "" Just protect your fake baby. I'm hyperventilating. - Welcome back, Signora Roberts. - Thank you. She's very tired. - Take it. Take it. - Okay. Oh, let's hide. Let's hide. Julia? My name is Teresa. I thought I saw a friend of mine, someone that I know. No, absolutely not. You can't turn off the pressure sensors. No. Well, she can't touch it. She's a movie star. She's not the pope, for Christ sake. You're from Smyrna, Georgia. You were born in 1967. - You like croquet and knitting. - Your middle name is Fiona. You've got 10 dogs, seven horses. - Your favorite color is peach. - She doesn't have more horses than dogs. - I can't do this. I can't. - Tess, we're out of time. - ""Julia,"" please. - Julia. No, we understand you're feeling insecure. That is totally natural. You're playing an actress. They're insecure. No, I'm not insecure. I'm freaking out. - Yes. That's right. - Brilliant! You're playing a role. No, you're playing a role. I'm apparently playing a real person. - Yeah, so? - It's just wrong. You mean, like, morally? No. Well, yes. Probably... It's not the point. The point is you want me to speak... ...for someone who's out there somewhere. It's too personal. More personal than your husband doing 25-to-life? He won't do 25-to-life. Benedict will have him killed immediately. - Don't. - I'm sorry, that was stupid. We're gonna be in and out in 10 minutes. We have to. That's our time frame. You don't even have to talk. Give them a big smile, wave at the cameras. - That's all she ever does. - But if you do say something... ...don't forget your accent. Drop your G's, and longer vowels. Room service. It's gonna be fine. You've gotta remember something. You are an image to these people. You're like an object. Nobody actually knows you. The last thing this is gonna be is personal. - Aren't you overdue? - Why are you in Rome? - I'm here on vacation. - I love you. You are not supposed to fly eight months pregnant. - I know. - Is Danny here? - Of course. - Danny. - No, no, I mean, he has... - He's working? - Yes. Yes and no. He's working. - In Rome? - Bruce. Glen Snackwell, publicity. - Hey, Glen. - I'm a big fan. - Thanks. Great. You fired Marcy? You fired Marcy. Two weeks ago, you told me I should go with Marcy. - I'm sorry. - Tell him what happened with Marcy. - There's a story? - Always a story with Marcy. - Marcy... Marcy... - You look fantastic. - Such a surprise. - You should sit down. I'm with the studio. Marcy's still very much in the picture. I just wanted to get you for a second. We're looking to come off this baby thing strong. You know, that little statue on the mantle starts smirking at you after a while. You know what I'm saying? - Not really, Glen, no. - Sorry. Yeah. Hey, Jules, that reminds me. I've been meaning to call you since the girls and I were in Taos. - It's so good to see you. - Come here. These are a mess. Anyway, Tallulah left her SpongeBob blanket in the red casita. - Okay. - So, what I wanna do... Here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thanks, Bruce. - Is call Marcus... ...and have him get ahold of Louise so we can make arrangements to get it. He's home now, right? - Marcus... - I need to talk to Marcus. - That's so funny. What a coincidence. - Go ahead. Talk to him. Over by the window, with the reception. - Hello? - Hello, Marcus? No, it's Julia. Who's this? It's Julia. I'm with Bruce Willis. You're with Bruce right now? Can I speak with him? Oh, yes, Tallulah's SpongeBob. - I'm sorry, can I talk to him for a sec? - Did it drop out? - Yes, it fell out. - That's been happening all week. - Put that phone away right now. - What? Hang it up and put it away. Do you have any idea how vulnerable... ...a fetus' brain is to the electromagnetic field created by your cell phone? You might as well point a gun at her stomach. - I'm Bruce Willis. - Simon Leopold. - I am Julia's physician. - He's a doctor. What happened to Dr. Webber? - You know, Doc...? He was sick. - Dr. Webber is on vacation. - Well, he's sick. - He's sick on vacation. - Sick on vacation. - Don't you hate that? Sick on vacation. Sorry to have jumped on you, Mr. Willis. You do very good actings. Thank you. - Snackbar. - Snackwell. It doesn't matter. If we are to get there at 4:00 and do that... - I say 50-50. - Closer than that. - 2-1 they don't make it to the museum. - 5-1 they don't make it to the Egg Room. What? - She's still my wife. - She's a novice. You said so. - Led by an apprentice. - Being tracked by a pro. You want her to win. - Which her? - You know which her. - The one that started all this. - Right. - Good. For a minute... - Why would I say that? It's not her fault. - It wasn't. - Okay, then. - Good. - Good. - I'm confused. - Yeah, who are you talking about? - Isabel. - Tess. - I loved it, but I figured it out. - Not a lot of people did. - That's amazing. - The second she doesn't... ...talk to you in the restaurant, I knew... You figured that out. - Yeah, the movie still works for me. - Great. Can we just...? Does she really need to be rushing this quickly? - She's practically jogging. - In Thailand... ...mothers routinely give birth in rice paddies and then go right back to work. - Amazing women over there. - Rice paddy? She will not have it in a rice paddy. She'll be at her own paddy. And she will be very comfortable because she will be strong... ...from this walk and this exercise. Was she worth it? Was Tess? The moment that she doesn't talk to you in the restaurant, I knew. - Your friends didn't tell you? - No. - That's when you figured it out, huh? - Yeah. - But the movie was still enjoyable for me. - Okay. Thanks. If everybody's so smart, how come the movie did $675 million worldwide... ...theatrical. Julia. Doctor. Doctor, you might wanna call the rice paddy now. Seal off the museum. Nobody in or out. - Bring... Bring it, bring it. - Quickly, quickly. - Sit her down. Sit her down. - Everybody just relax. - Can you hear me? Talk to me. - She is fine. She is fine. She's good? Okay, that's it. We're done here. No more pictures. - Thank you, Bruce Willis. - Just don't worry. - Thank you, museum. We are code four. - Walk slowly, like you're doing. We'll get you into the car as fast as we can. Okay, we're not stopping. Don't stop. - Hello. - We're on our way out. Isabel Lahiri, I'm with the museum. It is so great to meet you. - We're very late. - I'm sorry, this won't take long. I don't wanna be an annoying fan, but my boyfriend is such a huge fan. I can't let you leave unless you sign something for him. Do you mind? - That's very unorthodox. - Sorry, it won't take long. - What's his name? - His name's Robert. Aren't you a lefty? I thought you were a lefty. She is a lefty. Often pregnant women become ambidextrous. You are a big fan. She doesn't necessarily have to sign lefty. Oh, thanks so much. This is great. Okay. We're on the move. Thank you. You take care, now. And one more thing. I just got off the phone... ...with someone called Marcy who put you on a plane from New Mexico to L. A... ...where you have a 1:00 meeting about a film, Clowns Can't Sleep. Anyway, she just wanted me to let you know everyone's running a little late... ...and was wondering if you could make it at 1:30 instead. I knew it. Shame on you. I don't think we've met. Bruce. Isabel Lahiri. Nice to meet you. Do you really have a boyfriend? Or were you just...? Was that just part of the whole thing with them? So how'd it go? You Lahiri? I'm Section Chief Molly Starr. I spoke to a very nice man at Europol this morning, Commissioner Greisman. He wants you on the next flight to Amsterdam. There seems to be some irregularity with your paperwork. That one. Let's start with that one. Imagine yourself in a room... ...that's too short for you to stand up in and not wide enough to lie down in. A room with no light, no heat... ...and stone walls scratched by the teeth and nails of desperate men... ...men driven crazy by isolation. You will have rats for company... ...and a small window that looks out on the world that has passed you by. Your parents will grow old and die, just like your dreams. Your friends will forget your name, tell your stories as their own... ...because what good is a story when the person who owns it has vanished? - What do you want? - Testify against the others... ...in the Benedict case. The Italian charges will be dropped. You and the others will be extradited to the U.S. this afternoon. Plead, and you walk with parole. I can't. Think about it, Linus. For a moment there, I was already forgetting your name. Wait. Just hang on a sec. Linus. Right. Thanks. You okay? - Well, I blew the meet with Matsui. - Matsui? Let me guess. He pulled a Lost in Translation on you. That's his idea of fun for first-timers. - I mean... How do I not see these things? - Don't get down on yourself. - Obvious. - We talked about this. I hope Danny and Rusty appreciate the job you did in a tight jam. I am proud of you. - Thanks. - We both are. - You...? You told Dad? - I had to, sweetheart. - You told Dad? - We were on vacation. I'm sorry. Great. Thanks. You're gonna be dining out on this one for months. ""Hey, remember the time your mom had to come to Rome... "" I'm sorry. Every time with him. It's like... It's like a... It's like a... That was for keeping me in the dark. And that... That... ...is for making me a master thief. - And that... - Okay. ...is for ruining our second third anniversary. Okay. Okay? Come here. I'm sorry I kept you in the dark. I'm sorry that I made you a thief. - Master. - Master thief. And I'm very sorry that I ruined our second third anniversary. - Okay? - Okay. You forgive me? - A little. - All right. What was Bruce Willis like? Was he...? Follow it. That's Ryan's car. Follow that one. Hey, wait, wait! What the hell is going on? Your father's alive, Izzy. Your mom lied to you... ...to keep you from him. He's alive. - What are you talking about? When they divorced, she told him if he contacted you she'd go to the cops... ...with everything to put him in jail. How do you know that? And why should I believe you? I don't believe you, okay? You know where he is? I know somebody who does. There's nothing back there but a forged 1077. - No. Really? No. - No. That'd be horrible. It's hard, you know, for dinners. Well, you must have very good contacts. I hear it usually takes days to buy your way out. - Tess, this is Francois Toulour. - Madame Ocean, at last. - Hello. - He's French. Shouldn't you be somewhere else by now, like... ...Outer Mongolia, maybe? Well, before we get to that, we just wanted to ask you one question. - What is that? - How'd you do it? Oh, so that's why you came. You wanna know. Well, I guess that's normal. But I got another deal for you. You both recognize that I'm the best, and I'll tell you my secret. - Yeah. - That... get him to tell us... - And tell him that he is the best. - Oh, okay. - I won't tell him because you're the best. - All right. Thank you. All right. We'll tell you you're the best after you tell us how you did it. How can I refuse a dying man's last request? The egg arrived in Rome at 6:45 p. m. the Saturday before it went on display. - It was at the museum by 8 p.m. - Wait a minute, hold on. You stole it that evening? With the museum locked down? How'd you get in the building? How'd you get past the sensors? Why didn't my recon team see you? - Don't touch my thing. - I didn't touch your thing. Like it works. You got greasy hands, you put them on the lens. Now I can't see. - You can't see anything. - I see you. You look like a retard. You look like a retard. I'll pay you a million dollars if you don't speak for a month. One month. - I wanna eat your whole head. - Go ahead. A million dollars. No joke. Right. With no equipment, no rope. Of course. Come on, don't tell me you don't know how to do that. How did you get by the laser field in the Great Hall? The laser fields. Well... Okay. Toulour, you're the best. Well, thank you, Danny. Good. Now, if you can just get us our money... ...we'll be going. The money? What money? The money that you agreed to pay Benedict if we won. - We're under a deadline. - No, no, no, you don't understand. You didn't win. You lost. And not only did you lose... ...your entire crew got pinched. I gotta tell you something. You don't look anything like her. Eventually, the nose, but the ears... I mean, the way you walk and you dress... That means that you spoke to LeMarc. You spoke to LeMarc? Since I'm dead, I think my involvement in this should stay among the three of us. - Of course. - Absolutely. It's ironic that the solution to all of our problems will be provided by Toulour. I'm sure I provoked him by agreeing with my American friend... ...that you might be better than him. I apologize sincerely for the trouble I've caused you. - There's no need. - Especially now. Remember, from the time you see Toulour at his villa and the challenge begins... ...you must assume he will have you under surveillance everywhere you go. You'll have to put on a very elaborate show. The egg, the real egg... ...will be carried in a backpack on a train leaving Gare du Nord... ...at 9:30 a.m. - Thank you. You saved our lives, Gaspar. Yeah. And I'm still getting the better of you. And I stole a replica? Your paintings are in a high-security warehouse in Milan. It's 17 Via Andreotti, unit 222. - Security code is 2-3-1-1-6... - 6-4-6. Thank you. Listen, all games aside, that was... That was very good. That was good. How'd you do that? Well, I told you one story tonight. I think that'll be enough. So now... ...if you, both of you, could please... Now. - Whose house is this? - It belongs to a thief I know in Paris. He knows my father? Probably better than anyone. Who is he? - He helped with the Night Fox thing. - What's his name? His real name? I don't know, actually. I've only known him as LeMarc. LeMarc? Oh, my God. Where the hell have you been? Waiting. For what? For this. Oh, my God. So we done? Issue closed? - Is it actually good? - It's good. Trust me. I don't trust you, and I don't trust Ocean. If it's good, we're done. These grudges, they're awful. Nobody wins. Danny's had enough of this meshugaas. And the competition, it's worse than our business. Always some new young punk trying to prove himself. Guys like Ocean, they keep coming back. They don't like to lose. - Too much ego, too much pride. - Maybe for some guys, but not Danny. Trust me on that. Danny don't feel like he lost in all this. It's hard to believe, but that's how he feels. Well, if he tries anything... If anybody tries anything, I'll be waiting. Terry, I can't predict the future. I pay professionals to do that, and even they get it wrong sometimes. I can't say that nobody'll ever try to rob from you again. But I can say this: If, God forbid, anything does happen to you... ...we will not be involved. You better not be, Reuben. You better not be. Hey. Good to see you guys. You don't remember? You put me through hell, and you don't remember? - Hey. - Hey. - You're more beautiful than ever. - Hey! - Five-oh-five? - Four-oh-five. - Who's winning? - I'm little. - And you're big. - You're big? Oh, my God. - Hello. - Oh, my God. You're all under arrest. You're thieves. You're crooks. Isabel, Livingston Dell. Thank you. Isabel, Tess. The adult table. That's the kids' table. - Let me clear that for you. - I'm in. - Right, Danny. - Can I get another beer? - I feel I know you. - Wait, wait. We didn't... We didn't bet. You want five? - Five. - So nasty. Okay. Is that a joke? Yes. - Jesus Christ. - She's drunk!, This global warming is killing me. This is too hot, the Ice Age was too cold. What would it take to make you happy? This I like. Oh, no, you won't catch me. No running, James. Camp rules. Make me, sloth. Make me, sir. It's all about respect. Water ball. Sammy, you just ate. Wait an hour. Hector, no, no, no, you can't pee-pee there. OK, there is fine. Ashley, stop picking your... Pinata! Stop! You're supposed to wear blindfolds. OK. - Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth. - Mine. - Mine. - Mine. Hey, you didn't have any candy in you. - Let's bury him. - Yeah! Hey, whoa. Who said you kids could torture the sloth? Manny, don't squash their creativity. Hey, Manny, Diego, my bad mammals-jammals. Wanna give a sloth a hand? Look, I opened my camp. ""Campo del Sid"". It means Camp of Sid. Congratulations. You're now an idiot in two languages. Not in front of the k-i-d-z. These little guys love me. Right, Billy? Don't make me eat you. They kid. That's why they're called kids. I told you, Sid. You're not qualified to run a camp. What do qualifications have to do with childcare? Besides, these kids look up to me. I'm a role model to them. I can see that. You guys never think I can do anything, but I'm an equal member of this herd. I made this herd, so you need to start treating me with some respect. - Come on, Sid. - Sid, we were just kidding. Hey, let's play pin-the-tail-on-the-mammoth. Yeah! Sid! I can do stuff. Won't give me their stupid respect. I'll show 'em. And so, in the end, the little burro reached his mommy. And they lived happily ever after. - Good job. - Question. Why does the burro go home? Why doesn't he stay with the rabbits? Because... because he wanted to be with his family. He should go with the girl burro. That's a better love story. OK, well, when you tell your burro story, that's what he'll do. Burro is a demeaning name. Technically, it's called a wild ass. Fine. The wild ass boy came home to his wild ass mother. See, that's why I called it a burro. Could the burro have a grazing problem? Then he'd be more relatable. - Boring. - It's not believable. - Do burros eat their young? - It's not a good ending. Sometimes I throw up. They lived happily ever after. You can't get more satisfying than that. One big, happy family. That's the way it's supposed to be. Where's your big, happy family? Then the hungry tiger ate the pesky little kids. - You OK, buddy? - Sure. Why not? - I thought... - Story time's over. The end. - Run for your lives! - Where's everybody going? - The world's coming to an end. - What are you talking about? Fast Tony - he says the world's gonna flood. Folks, I hold in my hand a device so powerful, it can actually pull air right out of the sky. Yeah, right. Gather round, gather round. Pardon me, do you have gills, ma'am? So you can't breathe underwater? My assistant here will demonstrate. Hey, I can smell the ocean. What are you doing? I can't sell that now. You suck air through your mouth, you moron. Through its design and sturdy construction, you'll have plenty of air for eons to come. Of course, results may vary. Why are you scaring everybody with this doomsday stuff? I'm trying to make a living here, pal. It's my weather forecast. The five-day outlook calls for intense flooding followed by the end of the world. And a slight chance of patchy sunshine later in the week. Come on, don't listen to him. Fast Tony would sell his own mother for a grape. Are you making an offer? I mean, no, I would not. Haven't you heard? The ice is melting. You see this ground, it's covered in ice. A thousand years ago, it was covered in ice. A thousand years from now, it will still be ice. Say, buddy, not to cast aspersions on your survival instincts or nothing, but haven't mammoths pretty much gone extinct? - What are you talking about? - About you being the last of your kind. Your breath smells like ants. Be that as it may, when's the last time you saw another mammoth? Don't pay any attention to him. Mammoths can't go extinct. They're the biggest things on Earth. What about the dinosaurs? The dinosaurs got cocky and made enemies. Look. Some idiot's going down the Eviscerator. Please tell me that's not our idiot. OK, I'm gonna jump on the count of three. One, two... Sid, don't move a muscle. We're coming up. Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Sorry. Two and three one-thousandths, two and four one-thousandths... Sid, what are you doing? Get down from there. No. I'm gonna be the first to jump off the Eviscerator and then you guys are gonna have to show me some respect. The only respect you'll get is respect for the dead. Come on, Manny, he's not that stupid. - But I've been wrong before. - Geronimo! Hey, watch it. I can't breathe. I think I just coughed up my spleen. - Diego, retract the claws, please. - Right. Sorry. If I didn't know you better, Diego, I'd think you were afraid of the water. OK, OK. Good thing I know you better. Guys. Fast Tony was right. Everything is melting. It's all gonna flood. Come on, we gotta warn them. Maybe we can rapidly evolve into water creatures. - That's genius, Sid. - Call me Squid. This whole thing's a piece of junk. I can't believe I live here. What? Forget reeds. I present you with this revolutionary gizmo we call bark. - It's so buoyant, it actually floats. - I'll show you something that floats. All right, it's your funeral. See? This is exactly what I'm talking about. Giants balls of furry lava the size of mammoths raining from the sky. Go suck air through a reed. Listen to him. He's right about the flood. I am? I mean, yes, I am. Wait. You said there wasn't going to be a flood. Why should we listen to you? Because we saw what's up there. The dam's gonna break. The entire valley's gonna flood. Flood's real, all right. And it's coming fast. Look around. You're in a bowl. Bowl's gonna fill up. Ain't no way out. What are we gonna do? Unless you make it to the end of the valley. There's a boat. It can save you. - I don't see anything. - But y'all better hurry. Ground's melting, walls tumbling, rocks crumbling. Survive that and you'll be racing the water, cos in three days' time, it's gonna hit the geyser fields. Boom! There is some good news, though. The more of you die, the better I eat. I didn't say it was good news for you. He must have been a real pleasure to have in class. Dam. All right, you heard the scary vulture. Let's move out. Manny, you really think there's a boat? I don't know, but in a few days, this place is gonna be underwater. If there's any hope, it's that way. Manny, let's go. Overturned glyptodont in the far right lane. Traffic backed up as far as the eye can see. And it looks like there might be a fatality. I call the dark meat. Come on, everybody, let's go. Come on, come, come, come. Get in. - Come on, Grandpa, come on. - We have to go. Well, I'm not leaving. I was born in this hole and I'll die in this hole. Do we have to bring this crap? - I'm sure there's crap where we're going. - This was a gift from my mother. OK, keep it moving, keep it moving. Manny, I just heard you're going extinct. Hey, if you ever master hygiene, try working on sensitivity. - I'm not going extinct. - Kids, look. The last mammoth. Well, you probably won't see another one of those again. See? OK, one, two, three... Where is James? Stu. Come on, Stu. Let's blow this ice-cube stand. Stu. Folks, be the first in the valley to have your very own mobile home. - Shut up, Sid. - OK. Stop singing, Sid. Sid, I'm going to fall on you again and this time I will kill you. OK, someone doesn't like the classics. What if you're right? What if I am the last mammoth? But Manny, look at the bright side, you have us. Not your most persuasive argument, Sid. - Mammoths? - I knew I couldn't be the last one. I felt it in my gut. Extinct? Come on. He's up by a couple of fifths, ahead by a tusk. And he's beating Diego as Diego's coming round the corner. Sorry. My stomach hates me. Well, don't that put the ""stink"" in extinction? Nasty. Manny. I need to be alone for a while. You go on ahead. I'll catch up. One truly is the loneliest number. These work great. Cool. - Missed me, now you gotta kiss me. - I'll get 'em. - Which end is up? - I'd hide that face too. - Hey, ugly. - I gotta sit on that. Gotcha. OK, I'm going in. - Sid. - What? - Nice miss. - Cover your side. - I felt some breeze in that one. - Smile. - Out of my way. - Hello. Over here. - Surrender? - Never. Cool. Smoke them. If anyone asks, there were 50 of 'em and they were rattlesnakes. - Here, kitty, kitty. - Big mistake, you miscreants. Miscreants? Diego, they're possums. Retreat. I guess it's just you and me now. I knew it. I knew I wasn't the only one. Everyone falls out of the tree now and then. They just don't admit it. Wait. What? Some of us have a tough time holding on to branches. It's not like we're bats or something. We don't have wings to keep us up. And you were in the tree because...? I was looking for my brothers. They are always in trouble. Brothers? You mean there's more? Sure. - There's lots of us. - Where? Everywhere. Under rocks. In holes in the ground. Usually we come out at night so birds don't carry us off. Help! Help! Help! Well, shave me down and call me a mole rat. You found another mammoth. Where? Wait a minute. I thought mammoths were extinct. - What are you looking at me for? - I don't know. Because you're a mammoth. Me? Don't be ridiculous. I'm not a mammoth. I'm a possum. Right. Good one. I'm a newt. This is my friend, the badger. And my other friend, the platypus. Why do I gotta be the platypus? Make him the platypus. - This guy giving you trouble, sis? - Sis? That's right. These are my brothers. Possum, possum, possum. I don't think her tree goes all the way to the top branch. Manny, brink of extinction's a bad time to be picky. Hey, she should come with us. Are you insane? No way. OK. Manny wants me to ask you if you'd like to escape the flood with us. - I'd rather be road kill. - That can be arranged. Funny. Let me have a little word with my brothers. Ellie, are you crazy? We're not going with them. Look, we'll never make it in time if we only travel at night. These guys can protect us out in the open. What do you say? Why did you invite them? Cos you might be the only two mammoths left on Earth. He has a point. Sorry, when did I join this dating service? My brothers and I would be delighted to come with you. If you treat us nicely. See that? That's the total opposite of nice. Maybe we'll have a snack before we hit the road. You want a piece of us? Let's go. Banzai! - I got 'em. - Back! Back! You know the best part? We're carrying diseases. OK, thanks to Sid, we're now travelling together. And like it or not, we're going to be one big, happy family. I'll be the daddy, Ellie will be the mommy. And Diego will be the uncle who eats the kids who get on my nerves. Now, let's move it before the ground falls out from under our feet. I thought fat guys were supposed to be jolly. I'm not fat. It's this fur, it makes me look big. - It's poofy. - OK. He's fat. Escaping the flood is the perfect time to shed those unsightly pounds with Fast Tony's Disaster Diet. You, ma'am, you look like a big, fat, hairy beast. How would you like to lose a ton or two? Would I ever. Don't listen to him, Vera. You're already thin as a twig. I also have the perfect cure for your eyesight, my blind friend. We'll never make it at this pace. Ellie, it's OK, you can lose the camouflage. You're safe. OK. Safe? Please. Crash, Eddie, you two go scope it out. - What you got? - Perimeter all clear. - Roger that. One-niner, over. - Roger, over, victor... - Guys. - All clear. Hawk! - What are you doing? - Playing dead. - Manny, why don't you do that? - Because I'm a mammoth. But you'd do it for treats, right? Is he gone? You're safe. Get up. Man. If you weren't here, that hawk would have swooped down and snatched me for dinner. That's how cousin Wilton went. Boy, I really feel for you. I do. I can't even imagine what it'd be like to be the last one of your species. - I'm not the last one. - You brave, brave soul. That's right. Don't give up hope. Ellie. Look at our footprints. They're the same shape. Well, how do I know those aren't your footprints? Well, then, look at our shadows. We match. You're right. They're the same. You must be part possum. You wish. Diego, there are whole continents moving faster than you. We gotta catch up with the others. Hey. Knock it off. Cry me a river, blubber-tooth tiger. Have some fun. The ice is thin enough without you two wearing it down. Diego, come on. The ice may be thin, but it's strong enough to hold a ten-ton mammoth and a nine-ton possum. Mammal overboard! Ellie, get up. If you play dead, you'll be dead. Look at me. Diego. Diego. Come on, Diego. Come on. This may sting a little. - What in the animal kingdom was that? - I don't know. From now on, land - safe, water - not safe. That was the bravest thing I've ever seen. - It was nothing. I... - It's not a compliment. To a possum, bravery is just dumb. - Yeah, we're spineless. - Lily-livered. Maybe mammoths are going extinct because they get in danger. Maybe you should run away more. Good point. Thanks for the advice. Happy to help. Do you believe her? ""Bravery is dumb. Maybe you should run away more"". She's infuriating and stubborn and narrow-minded. You like her. - I do not. - Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. - And so is yours. - What secret? You know, the one where you can't swim. That's ridiculous. Fine. But we're living in a melting world. You're going to have to face your fear sooner or later. Almost there. - OK. Ready, Eddie? - Set. Let's roll. Wait for me. No brakes. Gotta roll. Meet you at the other end. So you think she's the girl for me? Yeah. She's tons of fun and you're no fun at all. She completes you. Yeah. Hey, Manny. Can you pull back the tree and shoot me into the pond? - No. - Come on. You expect to impress with that attitude? I don't want to impress. Why are you trying to convince her she's a mammoth? Because that's what she is. I don't care if she thinks she's a possum. - You can't be two things. - Au contraire, Man-fered. Tell that to the bullfrog, chicken hawk or turtledove. He's never gonna let up on you. It'll be easier on all of us if you just go with it. So what do you want me to do? Pull the tree and shoot me into the pond. I don't know. If you're too lame to do it, we can get Ellie. No, no, no. No, I can do it. I can do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on. - Have you done this before? - Only a million times. Farther, farther, farther. Perfect. Fire! Yeah! I can fly! Crash! Crash! Crash! - Crash, are you OK? - What happened? - Manny shot him out of a tree. - What's wrong with you? - He said he could do it. - And you listened to him? Crash, whatever you do, don't go into the light. Can I help in any way here? You've done enough. - Are you happy now? - Crash, Crash, don't leave me. Who's gonna watch my back? Who's gonna be my wingman of mayhem? Who's gonna roll in that dung patch with me? Dung patch? - Wait. My legs. I can stand. - He can stand. - I can run. - He can run. It's a miracle. Hallelujah! What can I say? They're boys. They make my life a little adventure. You guys are so dead. Thanks for embarrassing me. Not the face. Ellie, Ellie, me too. She's not half bad. Crazy and confused, but sweet. So? So what's holding you back? My family. You can have that again, you know. No, Sid, I can't. OK, OK, but think about it. I mean, if you let this chance go, you're letting your whole species go and that's just... that's just selfish. I think I'm starting to get through to him. - Wait, wait. I got you. - Slowpoke. - Need help? - No, no. Just catching my breath. - You're stuck. - I am not. All right, then, let's go. I can't. I'm stuck. Don't you think that picking them up like this would be easier? Ellie? I know this place. You know, deep down, I knew I was different. I was a little bigger than the other possum kids. OK, a lot bigger. Now I understand why the possum boys didn't find me appealing. That's too bad, because as far as mammoths go, you're, - you know. - What? Attractive. - Really? - Sure. What about me is attractive? I don't know. Well, there's your butt. What about it? It's big. You're just saying that. No, no, no, I mean it. It's huge. Biggest darn butt I've ever seen. That is really sweet. What a crazy day. This morning I woke up a possum and now I'm a mammoth. Boy, Manny sure took a big leap with Ellie today. Sure did. He stood on the shore of uncertainty and dove right in. Splash. Kind of brave, huh? The way he faced his fear. I wouldn't know. Sabres don't feel fear. Come on, all animals feel fear. It's what separates us from, say, rocks. Rocks have no fear. - And they sink. - What are you getting at, Sid? It may surprise you to know that I, too, have experienced fear. No. You? Yeah. Yes, as impossible as it seems, the sloth has natural enemies that would like to harm or otherwise ""kill"" us. - I wonder why? - Jealousy, mostly. But the point is that fear is natural. Fear is for prey. Well, then, you're letting the water make you its prey. Just jump in and trust your instincts. You know, most animals can swim as babies. And for a tiger, it's like crawling on your belly to stalk helpless prey. But faster, OK? Now, claw, kick, claw, kick. I'm stalking the prey. Claw, kick. I look back over my shoulder to see if I'm being followed. And I'm breathing. And I'm stalking and I'm stalking and I'm... - I'm falling. - Correction. You're sinking. Kind of like a rock. Hey, do we do any special tricks like roll over? Or do we just throw our weight around? Whoops. Sorry. I don't know my own strength yet. Ellie, do you realize that now we have a chance to save our species? - Really? How are we gonna do that? - Well, you know... Did you just...? I'm not a mammoth for five minutes and you're hitting on me? I wasn't saying... Not right now. In time. I was just saying that it's our responsibility. What? All right, that came out wrong. I... You're very pretty, but we just met... Responsibility? Just doing your duty? Is that it? Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice to save your species. I got some news for you. You're not saving the species tonight or any other night. - So, how did it go? - Not bad. OK, let's go. We travelled with you all day, now you're coming with us at night. But we can't see at night. Then enjoy the flood. I can't even look at him. Pervert. Making friends everywhere you go. Just making friends. - Watch out, there's a stump. - Not anymore. I thought we could walk together. Crash, ask the mammoth why he thinks that. She said she thinks you're a jerk and to go away. She didn't say... Look, maybe if we spend more time... Tell him that I need a little personal space right now. - She said go jump in a lake. - And possums rule. - I can hear her, you know. - What do you want? A medal? Stop moving. Thank you. Manny, Ellie. Lock trunks. Now! Crash, Eddie. Grab on to that ledge. - Funny. Now what's your real plan? - Just do it. - Bye, Eddie. - Bye, Crash. - Bye, Ellie. - Go now. I'm sorry if what I said before offended you. What do you mean ""if"" it offended me? That it offended her! I mean that, that it offended you. - You just overreacted, that's all. - What? - Take it back. - There are other lives at stake here. - He's got a point. - He's got nothing. - It was a misunderstanding. - It was insensitive. - Apologize. - Why me? She overreacted. - Just apologies. - No. - Do it. - OK, I'm sorry. What? - He's right. I overreacted. - You mean... Not another word or I'll come down there and push you over myself. I got it. I got it. I got it. Manny, Ellie, run! Run! I guess we finally did something right together. Hey, don't mind me. Just hanging off the edge of a cliff here. - Remember the good old days? - Which good old days? You know. Yesterday, last week. Back when the trees went up and down and the ground stayed under our feet. Yep. Those were the good days. Possums were possums and mammoths were mammoths. - We should get some sleep. - Yeah. Tomorrow's the day the vulture said we're all going to die. Wait a minute. Can I help you? Now, that's what I call respect. Nice. Somebody here likes Sid. Who is your decorator? I mean, this is fabulous. Fire King. Fire King? Well, you know, it's about time someone recognized my true potential. Let there be fire. If only the guys could see me now. This is either really good or really bad. No, no, no. Me Fire King. Why kill Fire King? A thousand years' bad juju for killing Fire King. Super-heated rock from Earth's core is surging to the crust, melting ice built up over thousands of years. You're a very advanced race. Together, we can look for a solution. We have one - sacrifice the Fire King. - Well, that's not very advanced. - Worth a shot. No! No! Bad juju! Water? Water! Crash, I told you not to drink before bed. I didn't do this. At least, not all of it. - What's happening? - We overslept. We need to move. What if we're the last creatures left alive? We'll have to repopulate the Earth. How? Everyone's either a dude or our sister. Hi. Hey, Manny. Wow. What a night. You'll never guess what happened. You were sleepwalking. No, no, no. I was kidnapped by a tribe of mini sloths. - That was gonna be my second guess. - And they worshiped me. I mean, sure, they tossed me into a flaming tar pit, but they worshiped me. You were dreaming. Come on, the water's rising faster than we're moving. I'm telling you, I was kidnapped. I was worshiped. Guys. Fine. Can we slow down a little? I'm dying here. It was just a figure of speech. They just sit there, watching us. I wish I knew what they were thinking. There. Now you know what they were thinking. - Sid! - What? It's catchy. - We made it. - Yeah, we showed those scary vultures. It's just a little hot water and steam. How bad could it be? I just did something involuntary and messy. OK, come on. Manny. Get back. It's a minefield out there. There's only one way to go. Straight through. Straight through? We'd like to keep the fur on our bodies, thank you. - We'll head back and go around. - There's no time. The dam will burst before we make it. We'll drown. If we go through this, we get blown to bits. - We go forward. - We go back. - Forward. - Back. - Can I say something? - No. - You are so stubborn and hard-headed. - Well, I guess that proves it. I am a mammoth. - Come on. - Fine. I don't know. Drowning sounds like a much gentler way to go. Blown to bits sounds so sudden. He's going to get himself killed. Manny, wait. Manny. Kids, look, the last mammoth. I just heard you're going extinct. - You can't be two things. - She thinks you're a jerk. Where's your big, happy family? What's wrong with you? Manny, come on. We gotta go. Now! That way. Do not leave your children unattended. All unattended children will be eaten. - Have you seen a mammoth? - No, sorry. - Have you seen a mammoth? - No. Possum? About 11 foot tall? - Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth? - I sure have. Big as life. - Where? - I'm looking at him. Not me. Poor guy doesn't know he's a mammoth. - I don't see her anywhere. - Maybe she's already on board. Hurry, this way. Come on. - There it is. - Ellie! Help! Come on, come on, run! Push. - You guys gotta go. - We're not leaving you. - I'm not asking. - Ellie, no. Ellie, don't worry. We're going for help. Stay here. - Help us. - Help! Somebody help. Manny. Manny. - Manny. - It's Ellie, she's trapped in a cave. Ellie. Manny. - Help! - I'll save you. Great. Who's gonna save him? You really need to brush. OK, OK, OK. Jump in now. Come on, 'fraidy cat. Come on. You can do this, you can do this, you can do this. Trust your instincts. Attack the water. I am not your prey. I am not your prey. I am not your prey. Attack the water. Stalking the prey. Claw, kick. Even babies can do it. Come on. Claw, kick, claw, kick. Hey. I'm stalking the prey. Eddie. You did it, buddy. You kicked water's butt. Nothing to it. Most animals can swim as babies, you know. Yeah, but not tigers. I left that part out. There he is. Ellie, hold on to me. Manny, Manny, behind you. There they are. They made it. We thought we'd never see you again. We're gonna live. We're gonna die. Well, I'm not leaving. Grandpa, let go of the boat. The flood's over. - This is my boat now. - Come on, let's go. Come on, come on. Stu. We made it. We're gonna live. Well, I am anyway. I'm thinking about starting a swim school. Sid's Squids. All hail Fire King. Hi. Fire King avert flood. Join us, O great and noble flaming one. No, not so fast there, OK. You make a quality offer. But Fire King has a prior commitment. His herd needs him. He is the gooey, sticky stuff that holds us together. He made this herd, and we'd be nothing without him. - You mean it? - Sid. Sid. That doesn't mean ""want to touch"". Don't ask. We're not the last ones anymore. You're not coming? You wanna go with them? I am a mammoth. I should probably be with a mammoth. Don't you think? Yeah, unless... Unless? Unless I... I just wanna say... I need to tell you... I hope you find everything you're looking for. You too. Manny, you've come a long way since we met and I'll take full credit for that, but you need to let go of the past so you can have a future. - Go after her. - It's OK. We'll always be here for you. - I'll keep in touch. - Yeah, yeah. You're a good friend. Point made. Now, go on. Scat. Our Manny's growing up. Ellie! Ellie! Manny. Ellie, I don't want us to be together because we have to. I want us to be together because we want to. And I wanna be with you, Ellie. - What do you say? - Manny, I thought you were going... You're possum enough for me. Well, it's just you and me now. Two bachelors knocking about in the wild. Fine. But I'm not gonna carry you. - I still have my pride, you know. - Come on, buddy, for old time's sake. I'll carry him. - But your herd's leaving. - We are now. Shotgun! Manny, who do you like better? Me or Diego? - Diego. It's not even close. - Told you. Manny, you can't choose between your kids. He's not my kid. Not even my dog. If I had a dog and my dog had a kid... and the dog's kid had a pet, that would be Sid. - Can I have a dog, Manny? - No. - Ellie, can I have a dog? - Of course you can, sweetie. Ellie, we have to be consistent with him. I saved you, little buddy. Calm down. I saved you, little buddy. Remember?, Look, what is this? I'm supposed to... Colonel Tan-Sun Moon's H.Q. De-Militarised Zone North Korea. Open the bag. That will teach you to lecture me. Retract the blast doors. Find me a new anger therapist. I am Zao. You are late. Mr. Van Bierk. I've been looking forward to this meeting. Me too. My African military friends owe you many thanks, Colonel Moon. Few men have the guts to trade conflict diamonds since the U.N. embargo. I know all about the U.N. I studied at Oxford and Harvard. Majored in Western hypocrisy. From your modest collection of cars, I wouldn't have guessed. Show me the diamonds. Show me the weapons. Bring the weapons. Hiding weapons in the de-militarised zone. - It's a bit of a minefield out there. - America's cultural contribution. One million landmines. And my hovercrafts float right over them. RPGs, flamethrowers, automatic weapons... and enough ammunition to run a small war. My diamonds? Check it over quick. Don't blow it all at once. I have special plans for this consignment. His name is James Bond, a British assassin. Mr. Van Bierk, let me show you something. Our new tank buster. Depleted uranium shells, naturally. Naturally. And how do you propose to kill me now, Mr. Bond? It's pathetic that you British still beliee you have the right to police the world. You will not live to see the day all Korea is ruled by the North. Then you and I have something in common. Who is it? Where's my son? It's the General. Hello... Father. Why is there a fire? I'll be there in five minutes. Get the weapons out of here. And kill the spy. Saved by the bell. My son is dead. 14 months later I don't condone what they do here. Tell it to the concierge. Still you jest. Defiant to the last. Your people have abandoned you. Your very existence denied. Why stay silent? It doesn't matter anymore. Things are out of my hands. We reach the end, Mr. Bond. Spare me the unpleasantries. Fifty years after the superpowers carved Korea in two... and then you arrive. A British spy, an assassin. And now the hard-liners have their proof. We cannot trust the West. You... You took away my son. Your firing squad should have done the job for me. I hoped a Western education would help him become a bridge... between our worlds. But all it did was to corrupt him. Let's get this over with, shall we? My son had an ally in the West. For the last time, who was it? Who made him betray his country and name? The same person who betrayed me. Turn around. Start walking. Keep walking, please. Keep moving. Zao. I'm being traded... for you. Keep moving. Keep walking, please. Your time will come. Not as soon as yours. Keep walking, please. Look at him. Double check. You'd think he was some kind of a hero. - Reference nine. - Sir. Section four. Okay, hold him tight. Got him. Watch his legs now. All right, let's go. No biological agents in the prelim scan. He's clean. Pulse, 72. Blood pressure, 120/80. Indications of neurotoxins, histamine, serotonin and enzyme inhibitors. Scorpion venom. Note also traces of a venom antiserum. They'd sting him then administer the antidote. Yet his internal organs seem unaffected. Liver not too good. It's definitely him then. Morning. Welcome back. Such hospitality. You don't seem too pleased to see me. If I'd had my way, you'd still be in North Korea. Your freedom came at too high a price. Zao. He tried to blow up a summit between South Korea and China. Took out three Chinese agents before he was caught. And now he's free. I never asked to be traded. I'd rather die than let him loose. - You had cyanide. - Threw it away years ago. What is this? The top American agent... in the North Korean High Command was executed a week ago. The Americans intercepted a signal from your prison naming him. - And they think it's me? - You were the only inmate. They concluded you cracked and were hemorrhaging information. We had to get you out. And what do you think? With the drugs they gave you, you wouldn't know what you said. I know the rules. And number one is, no deals. Get caught and you're given up. The mission was compromised. Moon got a call exposing me. He had a partner in the West. Even his father knew. - Whether that's true or not, it's irrelevant. - No, it isn't. The same person who set me up then set me up to get Zao out. So I'm going after him. You're going to our evaluation center in the Falklands. Double-O status rescinded. Along with my freedom? For as long as I deem necessary, yes. You're no use to anyone now. - He's in cardiac arrest. - Get the crash cart. Notify his superiors. - He's flat-lining on the ECG. - Stand by. Two hundred joules. Three hundred. Get me some atropine. We're losing him! Stand by. Clear. I'm checking out. Thanks for the kiss of life. Security breach on level three. All personnel, defensive code red. Apprehend and detain with force. Security breach on level three. All personnel, defensive code red. Apprehend and detain with force. Security breach on level three. All personnel, defensive code red. My goodness, standards are falling. No tie, dear me. My usual suite, please. Do you have a credit card? Or even any luggage, sir? Mr. Bond, so good to see you. - It's been a long time. - Mr. Chang. Open the Presidential Suite. Send up my tailor. And some food. The lobster's good, with quails' eggs and sliced seaweed. - And if there's any left, a '61 Bollinger. - Of course. Do it... quickly. Been busy, have we, Mr. Bond? Just surviving, Mr. Chang. Just surviving. I am Peaceful Fountains of Desire, the masseuse. I come with compliments of the manager. I'm sure you do. Come in. On the bed, please. Face down. Yes, of course. I'm not that kind of masseuse. I'm not that kind of customer. You think I haven't always known you're Chinese Intelligence, Chang? - Hong Kong is our turf now. - Don't worry about it. I'm not here to take it back. Put your hands down. What the hell do you want? Just to help you settle a score. Zao killed three of your men. You get me into North Korea, I'll take care of him for you. What's in it for you? Chance to get even. Zao has information I need. - I'll have to ask Beijing. - Do it. Now get out. Unless you really wanna give me a massage. Mr. Bond. A little thank-you from us. Cuba? It seems Mr. Zao has lost himself in Havana. If you find him, say goodbye from us. With pleasure. HAVANA I'm here to pick up some Delectados. Delectados? We haven't made Delectados in 30 years. Universal Exports. Check with your boss. Raoul... Universal Exports. Follow me. Your passport, se? Or. I'd come to think the Delectados would never be smoked. They are particularly hazardous for one's health, Mr...? Bond. Mr. Bond. Do you know why? It's the addition of the Volado tobacco. Slow burning. It never goes out. Just like a sleeper. Sorry for the rude awakening. I love my country. I'd never ask you to betray your people. - I'm after a North Korean. - A tourist? A terrorist. One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Zao has no interest in other people's freedom. I still have some friends in high places. Favors called in. Some dollars spread about. We find your friend is here, on an island. In Los Organos. There is a strange clinic run by Dr. Alvarez. He leads the field in gene therapy. Increasing the life expectancy of our beloved leaders. And, of course, the richest Westerners. We may have lost our freedom in the revolution... but we have a health system second to none. You didn't do too badly out of the revolution. We all have our ways of getting by. You'd be surprised how many government officials come to me... - ...for reminders of the decadent times. - Yeah, well... - Mind if I borrow these? - Please. My sources tell me this Zao is very dangerous. I wish I could give you more help. I could use a fast car. Mojito, por favor. Mr. Krug, your admittance papers for the Alvarez Clinic. About bloody time, Fidel. Round up more girls and take them to room 42. Unless you want to be known as Fidel Castrato. Magnificent view. It is, isn't it? Too bad it's lost on everybody else. Mojito? You should try it. Giacinta Johnson. My friends call me Jinx. My friends call me James Bond. Jinx, you say? Born on Friday the 13th. Do you believe in bad luck? Let's just say my relationships don't seem to last. I know the feeling. The predators usually appear at sunset. And why is that? It's when their prey comes out to drink. Too strong for you? I could learn to like it. If I had the time. How much time have you got? Until dawn. What about you? I'm just here for the birds. Ornithologist. Ornithologist, huh? Now there's a mouthful. So you're gonna be busy tonight with the owls then? No owls in Los Organos. Nothing to see till the morning. Not out there anyway. So, what do predators do... when the sun goes down? They feast... like there's no tomorrow. Are you always this frisky? I've been missing the touch of a good woman. Who says I'm good? What do you want? - I don't need a wheelchair. - No? You do now. Se? Or. - Okay. - Gracias. Isla Los Organos. So you are to have DNA-replacement therapy. Let me explain the two phases. First, we kill off your bone marrow. Wipe the DNA slate clean. Phase two: Introduction of new DNA harvested from healthy donors. Orphans, runaways... people that won't be missed. I like to think of myself as an artist. And this is when I create. Thank you. It is a painful process, I'm afraid, but... all great art is. I'll certainly enjoy working on you. Of course, most artists are only truly appreciated... after they're dead. My father was a sergeant. We lived in Hampshire. I have fond memories of the countryside. Good. Got your attention. Who's bankrolling your makeover, Zao? Same person who set me up in North Korea? James? What's going on? Jinx, you gotta get out of here now! Move! Move! Move it! Let's go! You see, my friend, the chemical composition shows... this is from Sierra Leone. Conflict diamonds. There's some kind of marking here. - ""GG."" - Let me see. Yes. From the Graves Corporation in Iceland. That's his laser signature. A man called Gustav Graves discovered diamonds there... a year or so ago. Yet they're identical to conflict diamonds. What an amazing coincidence. How can he escape from a British warship... in the middle of Hong Kong harbor, right under your nose? - Interesting station, Moneypenny? - I got a storm warning. You were supposed to throw away the key... not leave the door wide open. Are you implying I had a hand in his escape? Well, Bond got away real fast, didn't he? It is what he's trained to do. Your boy's been very busy. He torches a clinic in Cuba. Listen, you put your house in order... or we're gonna do it for you. Your drink, sir. Lucky I asked for it shaken. - When's he coming? - I don't know. - Looks like your man won't make it. - He's right on time. Wonderful day to become a knight. Will you be using your title, Mr. Graves? I'm proud of my adopted nation, but I'd never stand on ceremony. After that entrance, you can't be surprised... you're called a self-publicizing adrenaline junkie, can you? I prefer ""adventurer."" We've heard about the Icarus space program. What's the secret? It's a surprise. You'll soon be enlightened. You work 24/7. Is it true that you don't need sleep? You get one shot at life. Why waste it on sleep? Aren't you trying out for the Olympic fencing team? - We hear you're training furiously. - I never get furious. As they say in fencing, ""What's the point?"" Thank you. We don't want to keep Her Majesty waiting any longer. - Mr. Graves. - Mr. Graves. Hit. That's a hit. Hit. Verity? James Bond. Your lesson. I see you handle your weapon well. I have been known to keep my tip up. Do you mind? I think I've come undone. Why not? Hit. Positions. Play. Feast your eyes on the finest blade in the club. Gustav Graves? His publicist, Miranda Frost. Gorgeous, isn't she? She took the gold at Sydney. - By default, if I remember. - Default? The one who beat her OD'd on steroids. Miranda deserved that gold. Now she's teaching Graves how to win one. He only plays for cash. He's won so much, nobody else wants to fight him. You wanna meet him? Absolutely. Lead on. - Gustav? - Verity. - And Mr...? - Bond. James Bond. - Have we met before? - I think I'd remember. Of course you would. My mistake. - Are you a gambling man, Mr. Bond? - If the stakes are right. A thousand a point too much for you? Care to place a bet, Verity? No, thanks. I don't like cockfights. Shall we? Excuse me. Best of three hits? Positions. Ready. Play. En garde. Hit. Positions. Play. Hit. Two-nil. Do you want to continue? - You wanna up the wager? - How much can you afford? Let's play for this. I picked it up in Cuba. I believe it's one of yours. My, my. They do get around. But then diamonds are for everyone. Brilliant specimen. Completely flawless. And chemically identical to African conflict diamonds. Then you're about to lose something very precious. Positions. Ready. - Play. - En garde. Oh, dear. You want to continue? Of course I want to bloody continue! But since we're upping the wager... let's up the weapons, shall we? Let's do this the old-fashioned way. First blood drawn from the torso. That is enough! It's just a little sport, Miranda. Seems you beat me, Mr. Bond. Settle downstairs, shall we? You're a rare challenge, Mr. Bond. I'm putting on a scientific demonstration in Iceland at the weekend. Icarus? Perhaps you could join us. Miranda, make the arrangements. Once I've smoothed things over with the club. What would I do without you? Can I expect the pleasure of you in Iceland? I'm afraid you'll never have that pleasure. Excuse me, Commander Bond. Someone left this for you. Place needed redecorating anyway. I heard of this place. Never thought I'd find myself here. Some things are best kept underground. An abandoned station for abandoned agents. - Your calling card. - So, what have you got on Graves? You burn me... - and now you want my help? - Did you expect an apology? I know you'll do whatever it takes to get the job done. - Just like you. - The difference is, I won't compromise. Well, I don't have the luxury of seeing things as black and white. - While you were away, the world changed. - Not for me. You're suspicious of Graves, or I wouldn't be here right now. - So, what do you have? - Nothing beyond the official biography. Orphan working in a diamond mine... learns engineering, makes a huge find in Iceland and gives half of it to charity. From nothing to everything in no time at all. - And his demonstration this weekend? - Probably just another publicity stunt. Tell me what you know about this Cuban clinic. Gene therapy. New identities courtesy of DNA transplants. So-called ""beauty parlor."" We'd heard rumors. I didn't think it really existed. It doesn't anymore. Zao got away, but he left these behind. All from Gustav Graves' mine. I think it's a front for laundering African conflict diamonds. We need to tread carefully. Graves is politically connected. Lucky I'm on the outside, then. It seems you've become useful again. Then maybe it's time you let me get on with my job. Forgive my mentioning it, but a perfect marksman... isn't really supposed to shoot his own boss. Check the replay. You'll find he's dead and she's only got a flesh wound. There's always an excuse, isn't there, double-O zero? Give me the old firing range any day. Yes, but it's called the future, so get used to it. So this is where they keep the old relics, then, eh? This is where our most cutting-edge technology is developed. - Point taken. - Must you touch everything? Does this still work? - Now, look... - So where is this cutting-edge stuff? I'm trying to get to it. Weapon, please. One pane unbreakable glass, one standard-issue ring finger. Twist so. Voilo. Ultra-high frequency single-digit sonic agitator unit. - You're cleverer than you look. - Better than looking cleverer... than you are. Follow me. Now, a new watch. This will be your 20th, I believe. - How time flies. - Yes, well, 007... why don't you establish a record by returning this one. Your new transportation. - Maybe you've been down here too long. - The ultimate in British engineering. - You must be joking. - As I learned from my predecessor... I never joke about my work. Aston Martin call it the Vanquish, we call it the Vanish. - Very good. - Adaptive camouflage. Tiny cameras project the image they see... onto a light-emitting polymer skin on the opposite side. To the casual eye, as good as invisible. Plus, the usual refinements: Ejector seat, torpedoes, target-seeking shotguns to shoot down mobile objects. The manual. Should be able to shoot through that in a couple of hours. Just took a few seconds, Q. Wish I could make you vanish. Come in. Before you leave on your mission for Iceland... tell me what you know of James Bond. He's a double-O. A wild one, as I discovered today. He'll light the fuse on any explosive situation... and be a danger to himself and others. Kill first, ask questions later. His method is to provoke and confront. A man nobody can get close to. A womanizer. You're going to be seeing a lot more of him in Iceland. With great respect, a man like him could blow my cover. You volunteered for this, but in three months, you've found next to nothing. Graves seems to be clean. Bond thinks differently, so I'm going to let him do what you so ably described: Mix things up a little with Mr. Graves. With you there... things won't get out of hand. In your three years in Cryptology, you've kept business and pleasure separate. You haven't fraternized with any of your fellow agents, despite several advances. It would be foolish to get involved with someone within the community. Especially James Bond. I'm Mr. Kil. Well, there's a name to die for. Three hundred and twenty-four miles an hour. A new personal best. Thruster two cut out again. Get it fixed. - Glad you could make it. Like my run? - You were on the edge of losing control. It's only by being on the edge that we know who we really are. Under the skin. Take your Donald Campbell. 1967, the Bluebird. Water speed record. - Campbell died on his return run. - But he died chasing a dream. - Isn't that the way to go? - I'd rather not go at all. - You don't chase dreams, you live them. - A virtue of never sleeping. I have to live my dreams. Besides, plenty of time to sleep when you're dead. Mr. Bond. - Miss Frost. - I'll show you your room. A palace of ice. You must feel right at home. This was built for tonight's demonstration. The human element necessitates a balance of heat and cold. Built on a lake? Hope Graves got things right. - What's that property next door? - The diamond mine. And Gustav's living quarters. Thank you. This is you. Wonderful. Would you like to show me more? Vodka martini. Plenty of ice, if you can spare it. Mojito? James. Here for the penguins this time? - Or for the view again? - I'm only interested in endangered species. Well, does that include me? - Depends on what you're up to this time. - So I left you in an explosive situation. Figured you could handle yourself. - No wonder your relationships don't last. - I just don't like to get tied down. You look terrible. You aren't looking too good yourself. - You're still feeling the side effects? - The insomnia is permanent for me. An hour on the Dream Machine keeps me sane. - What happened to you? - Bond. He knows nothing. I've been this close to him... and he didn't know who I really was. - You saw my father after your exchange? - Yes. - General Moon still mourns your death. - My death. Mr. Bond. - And Miss...? - Swift. Space and Technology magazine. Really? I take it Mr. Bond's been explaining his big-bang theory? - Yeah, I think I got the thrust of it. - I see. The demonstration's about to begin in five minutes. Shall we? Shall we? - Not ""Jinx"" anymore? - I'll always be a jinx to you. I'm always trying to give the planet something in return... for what it has given me: Those little shards of heaven known as diamonds. Diamonds aren't just expensive stones. They are the stuff of dreams. And the means to make dreams real. Imagine being able to bring light and warmth to the darkest parts of the world... being able to grow crops year-round, bringing an end to hunger. Imagine a second sun... shining like a diamond in the sky. Let there be light. I give you Icarus! Icarus is unique. Its miraculous silver skin will inhale the sun's light... and breathe it gently upon the Earth's surface. You have no idea how much Icarus is about to change your world. And now let us brighten this night with our inner radiance. All right, that's a wrap. - Vlad, show me the modifications. - Yeah. Here is the self-defense mechanism you asked me to build in. - Fifty-thousand volts? - A hundred. Armed... - and very dangerous. - Very. M warned me this would happen. That's why you tried not to be interested in me. God, you're even worse than your file says. They don't look too convinced. Come on, put your back into it. I know all about you. Sex for dinner, death for breakfast. Not gonna work with me. - No? - No. - You're getting good at this. - Stop it. Are we still being watched? - They left ages ago. - God, you're impossible. Let's get out of here. You'd better stay here. Keep up the charade of being lovers. All right. I admire your restraint. You were here a full two hours before anything blew up. The way you're going, you'll get us both killed. James, tell me what really happened in North Korea. I was betrayed. That was all. Occupational hazard. This is crazy. You're a double-O. It's only a number. James... be careful. Go back to your room. I'll come back for you. Why do you want to kill me? I thought it was the humane thing to do. Who sent you? Your mama. And she's really disappointed in you. I'll let you in on a little secret. This mine is fake, but the lasers... are real. She won't talk. Let's make it permanent. I'll use the laser. Don't leave a mess. - Jinx? - James! James! No, no! Turn it off! Off! Off! James, I could use a little help here. Switch it off... or I'll be half the girl I used to be. So, the girl who hates to be tied down, huh? Are you gonna get me off this? - What are you, CIA? - NSA. - We're on the same side. - Doesn't mean we're after the same thing. Sure it does. World peace, unconditional love... and our little friend with the expensive acne. - Zao? - Yeah, Zao. He's back there with some weird, psychedelic light mask. Probably brought it from the clinic in Cuba. He couldn't have brought it. It was already here. It belongs to another Korean. His boss. - We need Kil to help us get out of here. - I got a better idea. - I'm going to get backup. - Wait. Go to Miranda first. She's MI6. Warn her to get out. And what are you gonna do? Unfinished business. So you live to die another day... colonel. At last. I was beginning to think you'd never guess. Was it painful? - The gene therapy? - You couldn't possibly imagine. Good. I'm glad to hear that. But there have been compensations. Like watching you flail around in your ignorance. Granting you life just to see if you'd get wise. It's been fun. Well, the fun is about to come to a dead end. We only met briefly, you and I... but you left a lasting impression. When you forced me to present the world with a new face... I chose to model the disgusting Gustav Graves on you. Just in the details. That unjustifiable swagger. Your crass quips, a defense mechanism concealing such inadequacy. My defense mechanism is right here. So, Miss Frost is not all she seems. Looks can be deceptive. Yes. Did you find out who betrayed you in North Korea? Only a matter of time. You never thought of looking inside your own organization? She was right under your nose. It was so good of you to bring your gun to bed. Yes. Occupational hazard. You see, I have a gift. An instinct for sensing people's weaknesses. Yours is women. Hers and mine is winning, whatever the cost. When I arranged for the fatal overdose of the true victor at Sydney... I won myself my very own MI6 agent... using everything at my disposal: Her brains, her talent... even her sex. The coldest weapon of all. Hello. Miranda? There will be others after me. You mean your American friend, Jinx. Soon to be the victim of a tragedy. - An ice palace can be a treacherous place. - Hand over the toys. Oh, yeah. You know, I've missed your sparkling personality. How's that for a punch line? Kill him. I enjoyed last night, James... but it really is death for breakfast. Kill him, quietly. Kill him. Now! - He got away. - No matter. The pleasure of the kill is in the chase. Bring me the generals. Gentlemen... I promised you a demonstration. Now you will see the true power of Icarus. The Western spy runs, but he cannot hide. Icarus will lock on to the heat signature and concentrate the sun's power. Hey, boss, he beat your time. Time to draw the line. Global warming is a terrible thing. Yeah, nice moves, just like Bond. He was pretty vigorous last night as well. He did you? - I didn't know he was that desperate. - He's not coming for you. He just died running, trying to save his own skin. That's pretty good tailoring. I hope it doesn't shrink when it gets wet. Soon, we will be victorious. We've got one hour to wrap this up. Let's move. Come on, Jinx, where are you? All units report. Now! Warning, adaptive camouflage failure. Time to give the American her bath. Adaptive camouflage restored. Vlad, does the word ""ergonomics"" mean anything to you? Man? Machine? This is still a suitcase. Finish it, will you? Come on, it's warm in here. Come on. The cold kept you alive, huh? It must've kept you alive. Come on. What took you so long? I'm sorry. Agent Johnson. - James. - Charles. Okay, bring us up to speed on this. Another division mobilized north of the DMZ. 80,000 troops and counting. - And another million in reserve. - Moon's father won't allow a war. General Moon's under arrest. Hard-liners staged a coup. You deliberately misled me by implicating Bond. - If you'd told us about your agent... - She'd be dead. - Your mole would've made sure. - We wouldn't have a mole... if you'd told us that Frost and Moon were on the Harvard fencing team together. Knowing who to trust is everything in this business. Well, well, James Bond. - Just in time for the fireworks. - Let's get down to business. We're at DEFCON 2. And if the North goes south, they're gonna go south big-time. You don't just stroll through a minefield. You need some kind of an edge. - Icarus. - We're taking care of that... with an ASAT launch in one hour. - Where's Graves? - In a North Korean air base. They're right where we can't touch him. You can't... - ...but I can. - Look... we're here in case things escalate, not to make sure that they do. No incursions into the North. President gave me a direct order. And when did that ever stop you? You make your own decision. I'm sending in 007. You think I'd leave this in the hands of the British? You go with him. Approaching drop zone. Okay, let's go! - They've entered North Korean airspace. - Relax, Robinson. If our radar can't see those switchblades, the North Koreans sure as hell can't. Hey, boss, they launched against Icarus. Leave it on automatic. I hope nobody here is superstitious. That's one big mirror we're about to break. Oh, my God. Mobilize the South Korean troops. And get me the president, now! Still no news of Bond? Vehicles. Some big shots. It's him. - Three hundred meters. - Windage, one and a half. We gotta get on that plane. You, have my father brought down. Father... I regret our meeting had to be like this. You can't tell it's me? I don't know you. You've always found it difficult to accept me. That made my exile easier to bear... but I never forgot what you taught me. In war, the victorious strategist only seeks battle... after the victory has been won. You see, Father, I remember my Art of War... and this is what guarantees that victory. My son... What have you done to yourself? Come, Father. Watch the rising of your son. The second that hits the 38th parallel... hit them with everything we got. That may not be enough. Do you see, Father? Icarus is clearing the minefield... creating a highway for our troops. If the Americans don't run, Icarus will destroy them. Japan is a bug waiting to be squashed... and the West will shake with fear. But the Americans will send nuclear warheads. Icarus will swat them from the sky. You will destroy us. You would kill your own son? The son I knew died long ago. Father... you disappoint me. Caution. Caution. - Manual. - Up! Manual. - Up! Up! - Caution. - Manual. - Come on! Okay, guys. Okay. I got it. My, my. You get around. Let's see your gun. Left hand. That's it. That's it. Now drop it. Looks like your friends have bailed. Push on autopilot. Come on. That's it. Good girl. Well, drowning you didn't seem to work. I'll have to try something more to the point. One thousand meters and closing. I can read your every move. Read this. Bitch. Look, parachutes for the both of us. Not anymore. You see, Mr. Bond, you can't kill my dreams. But my dreams can kill you. Time to face destiny. Time to face gravity. I think I broke her heart. Looks like we're going down together. Not yet. - Get the back open. - Okay. Come on! - Come on. - I told you I was a jinx. I should have warned you... my relationships don't last either. At least we're gonna die rich. Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Now... you said something about going down together? James. Moneypenny. Oh, James. Moneypenny? I was just testing it out. It's rather hard, isn't it? Yes. Very. Wait, don't pull it out. I'm not finished with it yet. See? It's a perfect fit. - Leave it in. - It's gotta come out sooner or later. No, leave it in, please. Few more minutes? We really have to get these back. Still the good guys, huh? I'm still not quite sure how good you are. I am so good. Especially when you're bad., I got nothing, sir. No sign of Niobe or Ghost. Nothing but blue pills. - Should we try to contact them? - Won't matter. My gut says they're down. - We should start back. - If that ship can fly, we need it. I was afraid you'd say that. Search every pipe, every hole, every crack we know. Sweep as wide as possible, as fast as possible. - Lines are crawling with calamari. - The sooner we find them the better. - Thought you could use something to eat. - Thank you. Any change? No. - How is he? - He's gonna be fine. At least until he wakes up. - What do you mean? - Captain has some questions for him. He'd better have some good answers. You see these cuts? I think they're self-inflicted. - Why? - VDTs maybe. I don't know. But like I said, the answer better be good. Roland, I'd like to run another search through the Matrix. - For what? - For Neo. How could he be in the Matrix, sir? He's not plugged in. Please, for me. This is what keeps bothering me. What? His neural patterns don't read like someone who's in a coma. The strange thing is, I see these patterns all the time. - Where? - On someone jacked in. The big bupkes. Nada. He's not in there. - Sir, I got the projections. - How long? Based on point of entry and the past speed, the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours. Jesus H. Christ. All right, let's move with a purpose. AK, I want you on holographics. Mauser, I want forward and aft guns manned at all times. And make sure we are running on as few pads as possible. - Hey! You got a call. - What? Operator. It's Seraph. I bring word from the Oracle. You must come at once. Good morning. - Who are you? - My name is Sati. Your name is Neo. My papa says you're not supposed to be here. He says you must be lost. Are you lost, Neo? - Where am I? - This is the train station. - This isn't the Matrix? - That's where the train goes. That's where we're going, but you cannot go with us. - Why not? - He won't let you. - Who won't? - The Trainman. I don't like him. But my papa says we have to do what the Trainman says... ...or else he will leave us here forever and ever. Morpheus, Trinity, thank you for coming. One thing I've learned in all my years... ...is that nothing ever works out the way you want it to. - Who are you? - I'm the Oracle. I wish there was an easy way to get through this, but there ain't. I'm sorry this had to happen. I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here like you remember me... ...but it wasn't meant to be. - What happened? I made a choice, and that choice cost me more than I wanted it to. What choice? To help you, to guide Neo. Now, since the real test for any choice is having to make the same choice again... ...knowing full well what it might cost... ...I guess I feel pretty good about that choice... ...because here I am, at it again. - Do you know what happened to Neo? - Yes. He is trapped in a place between this world and the machine world. The link is controlled by a program called the Trainman. He uses it to smuggle programs in and out of the Matrix. If he finds out where Neo is before you get to him... ...then I'm afraid our choices are going to become difficult. - Why? - Because of who the Trainman works for. The Merovingian. He has placed a bounty on your lives. You must be careful at all times. Seraph knows how to find the Trainman. He'll go with you. For years he has protected me. I hope he can do the same for you. Please, follow me. Oracle... I know, Morpheus. I can see you're filled with doubt, clouded by uncertainty. After everything that has happened, how can you expect me to believe you? I don't. I expect just what I've always expected: For you to make up your own damn mind. Believe me or don't. All I can do is tell you that your friend is in trouble, and he needs your help. He needs all our help. - Are you from the Matrix? - Yes. No. - I mean, I was. - Why did you leave? - I had to. - I had to leave my home too. Sati! Come here, darling. Leave the poor man in peace. Yes, Papa. I am sorry. She is still very curious. - I know you. - Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman. I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife, Kamala. My daughter, Sati. We are most honored to meet you. - You are programs. - Oh, yes. I am the power-plant systems manager for recycling operations. My wife is an interactive software programmer. She is highly creative. What are you doing here? You do not belong here. Kamala! Goodness, I apologize. My wife can be very direct. It's okay. I don't have an answer. - I don't even know where ""here"" is. - This place is nowhere. It is between your world and our world. - Who's the Trainman? - He works for the Frenchman. Why did I know you would say that? The Frenchman does not forget, and he does not forgive. - You know him? - I know only what I need to know. I know that if you want to take something from our world into your world... ...that does not belong there, you must go to the Frenchman. Is that what you're doing here? - Rama, please. - I do not want to be cruel, Kamala. He may never see another face for the rest of his life. I'm sorry. - You don't have to answer that question. - No, I don't mind. The answer is simple. I love my daughter very much. I find her to be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. But where we are from, that is not enough. Every program that is created must have a purpose. If it does not, it is deleted. I went to the Frenchman to save my daughter. - You do not understand. - I just have never... Heard a program speak of love. - It is a human emotion. - No, it is a word. What matters is the connection the word implies. I see that you are in love. Can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection? Anything. Then perhaps the reason you are here is not so different than the reason I am here. That's him. - Get away! Get away from me! - We don't want trouble. - Get the hell away from me! - We need your help. I can't help you! No one can help you! Oh, no! Damn it! - When is the train due? - It is already late. It's not like the Trainman to be late. - You think it has something to do with me? - I cannot say. Who knows such things? Only the Oracle. - You know the Oracle? - Everyone knows the Oracle. I consulted with her before I met with the Frenchman. She promised to watch Sati after we said goodbye. Goodbye? - You're not staying with her? - It is not possible. Our arrangement with the Frenchman was for our daughter only. - My wife and I must return to our world. - Why? - That is our karma. - You believe in karma? Karma is a word, like love. A way of saying: ""What I am here to do."" I do not resent my karma. I'm grateful for it. Grateful for my wonderful wife, for my beautiful daughter. They are gifts, and so I do what I must do to honor them. - Papa, the train! - Yes. Find your bag. Quickly. Can I carry that for you? All right. Hurry it up, I'm late! - Who are you? - He is a friend. I know you. - So that's what they wanted. - I need to get back. I'll pay you whatever you want. One way or another, I'm getting on this train. Oh, no, no, no. You'll stay here until the Merovingian says different. If I know him... ...you're gonna be here for a long, long time. - I don't want to hurt you. - You don't get it. I built this place. Down here, I make the rules. Down here, I make the threats. Down here, I'm God. Get on the train or you'll stay here with him. We should return to the Oracle. She will know what to do. No. We know what has to be done. Shit. You gotta be kidding. Holy shit, it's wingless. I get it. You must be ready to die. I need to speak with him. Only way you're getting through this door is over my big, dead ass. So be it. There are no weapons allowed in the club. At the bottom of this elevator, there is a coat-check girl... ...and if we are lucky, one man for checking weapons. And if we're unlucky? There will be many men. Can I take your...? Oh, my God. What in the hell? I don't believe this. Hey! The prodigal child returns. Are you here for the bounty, Seraph? Tell me, how many bullets are there in those guns? I don't know, but I don't think you have enough. - We only want to talk. - Oh, yes. I'm sure you do. You have fought through Hel to do so. Yes? I'll tell you what I will do. Put down the guns, and I will promise you a safe passage out of here. - All three of us? - Oh, yes, yes. Of course. Who could have guessed we would see each other so soon after our last meeting? The Fates are too kind, eh? And since you, my little Judas, have brought them here... ...I can only surmise that the fortuneteller has found herself another shell? Disappointing, but not unexpected. I do hope, however, she has the good manners to learn her lesson... ...and to remember that there is no action without consequence. And if you take something from me, you will pay the price. You know why we are here? Come now, what kind of question is this? Of course I know. It is my business to know. Some might think this is a strange coincidence, but I do not. I am curious, though, as to how it actually happened. - Do you know? - No. No? I did not think so. But it is always best to ask, huh? We want to make a deal. Always straight to business, huh, Morpheus? Okay. I have something you want. To make a deal... ...you must have something I want, yes? And it so happens there is something I want. Something I have wanted ever since I first came here. It is said they cannot be taken... ...they can only be given. What? The eyes of the Oracle. I told you before, there is no escaping the nature of the universe. It is that nature that has again brought you to me. Where some see coincidence, I see consequence. Where others see chance... ...I see cost. Bring me the eyes of the Oracle... ...and I will give you back your savior. It seems a perfectly fair and reasonable deal to me. Yes? No? I don't have time for this shit. You wanna make a deal? How about this? You give me Neo, or we all die, right here, right now. Interesting deal. You are really ready to die for this man? - Believe it. - She'll do it. If she has to, she'll kill every one of us. She's in love. It is remarkable how similar the pattern of love is to the pattern of insanity. Time's up. What's it gonna be, Merv? Okay. You got yourself in here... ...you can get yourself out. Are you ready for us? Almost, sir. They got some pretty ancient hacks here. - But you found Neo? - Can't you see him? No, sir. We read something, but I couldn't tell what. I can't leave yet. I have to see her. Now? It's my last chance. That's it. That's the secret. - You've got to use your hands. - Why? Cookies need love like everything does. Neo! I was hoping to have these done before you got here. Oh, well. Sati, honey, I think it's time for a tasting. Take the bowl to Seraph and find out if they're ready. Okay. - I'm glad you got out. - Me too. So do you recognize me? - A part of you. - Yeah, that's how it works. Some bits you lose, some bits you keep. I don't yet recognize my face in the mirror... ...but I still love candy. No, thank you. Remember how you were when you first walked through my door? Jittery as a June bug. And now, just look at you. You sure did surprise me, Neo, and you still do. You gave me a few surprises too. I hope I helped. You helped me to get here, but my question is, why? Where is this going? - Where does it end? - I don't know. - You don't know or you won't tell me? - I told you before... ...no one can see beyond a choice they don't understand, and I mean no one. - What choice? - It doesn't matter. It's my choice. I have mine to make, same as you have yours. Does that include what things to tell me and what not to? - Of course not. - Why didn't you tell me about the Architect? About Zion and the ones before me? Why didn't you tell me the truth? - Because it wasn't time for you to know. - Who decided it wasn't time? You know who. I did. Then I think it's time for me to know a few more things. So do I. Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in. Tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it. Tell me just what the hell is happening to me. The power of the One extends beyond this world. It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from. - Where? - The source. That's what you felt when you touched those sentinels, but you weren't ready for it. You should be dead, but apparently you weren't ready for that either. The Architect said that if I didn't return to the source, Zion would be destroyed tonight. Please. You and I may not be able to see beyond our own choices... ...but that man can't see past any choice. - Why not? - He doesn't understand them. He can't. To him, they are variables in an equation. One at a time, each variable must be solved, then countered. That's his purpose. To balance the equation. What's your purpose? To unbalance it. Why? What do you want? I want the same thing you want, Neo. And I'm willing to go as far as you are to get it. The end of the war. Is it going to end? One way or another. Can Zion be saved? I'm sorry, I don't have the answer to that question, but... If there is an answer, there's only one place you're going to find it. - Where? - You know where. And if you can't find the answer... ...then I'm afraid there may be no tomorrow for any of us. What does that mean? Everything that has a beginning... ...has an end. I see the end coming. I see the darkness spreading. I see death. And you are all that stands in his way. Smith. Very soon, he is going to have the power to destroy this world. But I believe he won't stop there. He can't. He won't stop until there's nothing left at all. What is he? He is you. Your opposite, your negative. The result of the equation trying to balance itself out. - And if I can't stop him? - One way or another, Neo... ...this war is going to end. Tonight, the future of both worlds will be in your hands... ...or in his. How are you feeling? Are you all right? I need time. - That figures. - Captain Roland. - What's up, Maggie? - Bane is. He's conscious. Good. Maybe he's got some answers. I love that smell. I sure am going to miss it. - Oracle. - I know. I know. Sati, honey. Take a few cookies and go with Seraph. Can I come back? I would like to come back. - I would like that too. - Then I'll see you tomorrow. I hope so, hon, I hope so. I'm scared, Seraph. Come. He's following us. Well, well, it's been a long time. I remember chasing you was like chasing a ghost. I have beaten you before. Yes, true, but as you can see, things are a little different now. And you must be the last exile. - The Oracle told me about you. - Really? What did she say about me? That you were a bad man. Oh, I'm not so bad, once you get to know me. The great and powerful Oracle, we meet at last. I suppose you've been expecting me, right? The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised. How can she be? She knows everything. But if that's true, then why is she here if she knew I was coming? Why wouldn't she leave? Maybe you knew I would do that, maybe you didn't. If you did, that means you baked those cookies and set that plate there... ...deliberately, purposefully... ...which means that you're sitting there also deliberately, purposefully. What did you do with Sati? ""Cookies need love like everything does."" You are a bastard. You would know, Mom. Do what you're here to do. Yes, ma'am. I really wish I could help, but I just... I don't remember any of it. What about the cuts on your arms? Those cuts are more than one day old. Yeah, definitely. You're right about that, sir. They look like they might be self-inflicted. But why would I do something like that to myself? Unless, of course, I wasn't myself. But if I'm not me, then who am I? - Has this man been tested for VDTs? - Yes, sir. It was negative. But he is showing a lot of unusual neural activity. Some cross-synaptic firing, as well as signs of recent trauma... ...with fresh fibrotic scarring throughout the cortex. I want the truth. I don't care what it takes. Make him remember. Sir, we found her. - The Logos? - Yes, sir. About time we had some goddamn good news. Are the thermals picking up any signs of life? No, sir. Nothing yet. - What about the ship? - Holographic says the hull's still intact. - Drop down and keep a man in the turret. - Yes, sir. Get a full diagnostic on that ship as fast as humanly possible. Careful, sir. The squids are sneaky bastards. It could be a trap. What was that? You can put that shit away, boys. All she needs is a jump. - Niobe. - Morpheus. - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine. We didn't know what happened after... - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'm happy to see you too. - Did you get Neo out? - Yes. - How did you know about that? - The Oracle. - You saw her? - Just before the sentinels found us. - What did she tell you? - The same thing she always does. Exactly what I needed to hear. In 12 hours, the machines will breach the dock walls. Every simulation we've run, we've seen that once the machines are inside the city... ...the odds of our survival decrease dramatically. Thus, our primary objective must be... ...to destroy or disable the diggers inside the dock. If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent them from ever reaching the city. If not, the only place we will be able to mount a defense... ...will be at the entrance of the temple. It is small and will force them into a bottleneck... ...allowing us to concentrate the remainder of our defense. We understand that you've requested additional volunteers. That is correct. Precisely what size force are you planning to commit to the primary dock objective? Right now, the entire APU Corps and half the infantry. - Half the infantry? - If it were up to me, councillor... ...I'd take every man, woman and child, put a gun in their hand... ...and march them into that dock. Perhaps it is best that it is not up to you. Time will tell, councillor. Commander, just one more question. Has there been word from the Nebuchadnezza? None, and at this point there's no reason to expect there will be. Perhaps. But we can hope. I'm afraid hope is an indulgence I don't have time for. - Zee, what are you doing? - Making shells. They're evacuating our level. We have to go. - I'm not going with you. - What? They've called for volunteers to hold the dock. Kids, you stay here. I know how you feel, but you can't do this. - I have to. - Why? Because I love him. I love him the same as he loves me. And if I were out there and he were here, I know what he'd do. But you're gonna get yourself killed. It's crazy, Zee. Maybe it is. But ask yourself, if it were Dozer... ...and you knew the only chance you had to see him was to hold the dock... ...what would you do? Make shells. What the shit is going on over here? An accident, sir. I didn't see... - I'm sorry. - Who the hell are you? A unit volunteer, sir. What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you doing volunteering for my Corps? I want to do my part, sir. We gotta hold the dock. - How old are you, kid? - Eighteen. Should have said 16, I might have believed that. Okay, I'm 16. Minimum age for the Corps is 18. Sixteen's too young. The machines don't care how old I am. They'll kill me just the same. Ain't that the goddamn truth. Give me a chance, sir. I won't let you down. You do, and you'll find me and the machines have got something in common. Okay, charge the igniter. She lives again. You want to reload the operations software, Sparky? Yeah. Could you clean the windshield while you're at it? Uplinks in place. I'm bringing her back online. Looking good, except... Something's wrong with the Matrix feed. No, there's not. You're looking at what we're looking at. -What's going on in there? - Whatever it is, it can't be good. The machines have taken Junction 21. The way I see it, if we drop down from broadcast here... ...intersect 153, we might surprise them. We'll go first, hammer as deep as we can, then blow our EMP. Hopefully we can punch a hole big enough for you to get through. It ain't pretty, but the way I see it, it's the only way back. No, it's not. There's another way. A support line. It drops down right here, 1000 meters short of 21. If we're lucky, we may be able to slip down without them ever knowing. That's a mechanical line. It's impossible. - No one can pilot a mechanical. - I can. - Bullshit. - I've done it. - That was a long time ago, Niobe. - I said I can do it. So what? You'll be the only one that can. There's no way we can follow you. Hi. I know time is always against us. I'm sorry that I took so long. - But I wanted to be sure. - Sure of what? - I know what I have to do. - What? There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just say it. - I have to take one of the ships. - What? To go where? To the machine city. I know it's difficult to understand. No, it's not. You're out of your goddamn mind. I still have to go. In 100 years, no ship has been within 100 kilometers of it. - You'll never make it. - I have to try. - Is this what the Oracle has told you? - No. This is asinine. If you want to kill yourself, do it... ...but do it without wasting our ships. - You have to believe me. I have to go. - Bullshit! I am the captain of this ship. I say where it has to go! And this ship will go to hell long before I let you take it anywhere. - He can take mine. - You can't do that. Don't try to tell me what I can or cannot do... ...with my ship after that little speech. - But for chrissake, Niobe... - I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine. If we leave inside the hour, we should reach Zion as the machines do. That's as good a plan as any. It's a waste. A goddamn waste. Two ships, two directions. Sounds like providence, doesn't it, Morpheus? - You've never believed in the One. - I still don't. Then why are you doing this? I believe in him. Thank you. - What's that for? - To help you relax. To make it easier for you to remember. What if I don't want to remember? Why would you want that? What if I blew that EMP? What if I did destroy those ships... ...and I am responsible for the deaths of all those men? If I did that... ...it wouldn't be very safe for me here, would it? Of course, it might not be very safe for you either. I'm ready. Trinity... ...there's something I have to say. Something you need to understand. I know I'm supposed to go. But beyond that... ...I don't know. I... I know. You don't think you're coming back. I knew it the moment you said you had to leave. I could see it in your face. Just like you knew the moment you looked at me that I was coming with you. I'm scared, Trin. So am I. It took me 10 minutes to buckle up one boot. But I'll tell you something. Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian... ...I was ready to give anything and everything for you. Do you know what's changed in the last six hours? No. Nothing. -Finished loading ammunition? - Just about. Let's move it. We are out of time. You're not leaving them anything? He said he didn't need it. I ain't saying goodbye. I'm saying good luck. Thank you. I can only hope you know what you're doing. Me too. It was an honor, sir. No, the honor is still mine. -We're ready, sir. - About damn time. We're already late, captain, so let's hit it and hit it hard. Bye, baby. Take good care of them. Ready? Engine's still firing. Must be a fuse. I'll check it out. - I should've known he'd send his bitch first. - Bane. No one ever got away from me as many times as you did. Every time, I thought it was the last. Every time, I was sure we had you, but you'd slip through our fingers. I really can't express just how aggravating that can be. What are you talking about? I think I might enjoy killing you as much as killing him. Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic! You're gonna pay for that. - Twenty-seven kilometers to go. -We got an emergency. - What is it, AK? -It's Maggie, sir. She's dead, murdered. I think it was Bane. Goddamn it. I knew it. I knew he was out of his goddamn mind. He fired that EMP. Goddamn it, I should have beaten it out of him. We searched the whole ship, captain. He ain't here. - I know where he is. - The Logos. - We gotta go back. - Too late. - What if they need our help? - It's too dangerous. - Why? - Because if he's killed them... ...he'll control another EMP. At this point, they're on their own. Just like us. Mr. Anderson. I see you are as predictable in this world as you are in the other. - What? - He's out of his mind. It might appear that way. But Mr. Anderson and I know... ...that appearances can be deceiving. Confused, Mr. Anderson? It'll all become clear in a moment. Thank you for bringing me the gun. You can set it down there. Don't do it. - Shoot. Shoot now. - Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive. Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both. Look at him. He knows he should do it, but he won't. - He can't. - Do it. Back away from the gun and turn around. Let her go. Somehow familiar, isn't it? We've been here before, you and I, remember? I do. I think of nothing else. - Who are you? - Still don't recognize me? I admit, it is difficult to even think encased in this rotting piece of meat. The stink of it filling every breath, a suffocating cloud you can't escape. Disgusting. Look at how pathetically fragile it is. Nothing this weak is meant to survive. - What do you want? - I want what you want. Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson. Look past the flesh. Look through the soft gelatin of these dull cow eyes and see your enemy. - No. - Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson. - It can't be. - There's nowhere I can't go. There is nowhere I won't find you. - It's impossible. - Not impossible. Inevitable. Goodbye, Mr. Anderson. This is it. It's gotta be. Oh, no. I wish you could see yourself, Mr. Anderson. Blind messiah. You're a symbol for all of your kind, Mr. Anderson. Helpless. Pathetic. Just waiting to be put out of your misery. I can see you. It's not over, Mr. Anderson. It's not over. - Trinity! - Neo. Neo. Oh, no. Your eyes. I'll be okay. It's all right, Trin. But I think you're gonna have to drive. Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach. They can't know we don't have an EMP. They'll have to attack in waves. Concentrate our offense on the diggers. Order the APUs into position. Yes, sir. Come on, move. All right! This is it. Now, you all know me, so I'll just say this as simple as I can. If it's our time to die, it's our time. All I ask is, if we have to give these bastards our lives... ...we give them hell before we do! Yeah! - You scared, Charra? - Shit, yeah. But I'll make you a deal. You keep loading, I keep shooting. Deal. - Holy Christ, would you look at that. - Quiet. - How far to the opening? - 1.4 kilometers. - We're still generating too hot a field. - Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems. - Give me full manual. Drop down four pads. - It'll bottom out. - Easy, baby. - Seven hundred meters. If we can just get close enough... Six hundred meters. There. Shit! - Jig's up, here they come. - Give me full power. Man the gun turrets, every goddamn one of them. Go! Ghost, you're the best gunner, go with them. Morpheus, take his place. I'm coming, baby. Here they come. -Slow down, this ain't theLogos. - Hang on to your lunch, Roland, here we go. Holy Christ, I didn't know this ship could do that. Breach! The dock is breached! Knuckle up! For Zion! Shit. Come on, let's go. Knuckle up! Reload! Reload nine! Go, go! Move, move! Watch your left! Don't let them through! Zuka! Oh, my God. Where the hell's my infantry? I want that goddamn machine taken down! Dig this! Oh, shit! - Bogey two at the breach point! - Goddamn it! Shit, she's got a fat ass. - Keep them off me! - Christ, there's a shitstorm of them. - You see that? - They're after the radio. Stop them! Damn it! Yeah. Grab my belt. Just give me one clean shot. Damn it! Charra! - I got incoming! - We got a dock full of incoming! - Yes, sir. But this is different, sir. - What? I think it's one of ours, sir. - That's impossible. - Holographics are trying to confirm. Contact them. I want access codes. We're trying, sir. There's no response. It's a trick. That's not one of ours, it can't be. That's a mechanical line. No one can pilot mechanical. - Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent. - Thirty degrees, 80. - Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent. - Sixty degrees. - Shit! Come on, keep up! - I'm trying! Sir, holographic confirms. It's the Hammer,sir. How can that be? It's under attack, sustaining damage. At its present velocity, it'll reach Gate Three in 12 minutes. Their EMP could take out every sentinel. It'd take out more than that. It'll wipe out our defense system. We blow an EMP inside, we lose the dock. Sir, we already lost the dock. Open the gate. Gate Three is not responding! We've taken critical damage, sir! We've lost control! We can't open it! There's the exit. On my mark, give me full power 90 degrees to lower-left starboard. Full power... ...ninety degrees. Now! Hold on, baby. Goddamn, woman, you can drive. We ain't home yet. What about the gate? Sentinels are inside the dock. Are we too late? - How many APUs are operational? - Thirteen, sir. Get me the one closest to Gate Three. Reload! He's pissing metal. Go! Go! Heads up! They're coming around! Behind you! It's jammed! Forget it, kid! Get out of here! Got it! Captain Mifune. Oh, no. They're coming. They're coming. The Hammer. What? You have to open that gate. Cut the counterweights. You can do it. Hurry. There's no time. Captain... ...I didn't finish the training program. Neither did I. - Lock that down! - Kill the feeder! We won't make it. We gotta blow the EMP now. Come on, someone, please. Keep the weight forward. Light as a feather. Holographic reports Captain Mifune's APU is up and moving to Gate Three. Don't over-squeeze the trigger. Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three. - How much time? - Two minutes to impact. - Captain Mifune, do you copy? - I think his radio is down, sir. Mifune... ...this is Lock. I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can... ... theHammer's two minutes away. You've got two minutes, captain, to get that gate open. Link. Get to the main deck! Charge the EMP! Do it, kid. Neo. I believe. - Yes! - Can we make it? We ain't come this far. Almost home, almost home. Burn it, Link! - You did it. - No. We did it. You're a hell of a pilot. Some things in this world never change. But some things do? Luckily... ...some things do. Link! - Zee? Zee! - Link! I knew you'd come. I knew it. I made a promise. You did wear it. Are you kidding? I'm never gonna take it off. Three captains, one ship. I'll assume the other ships were lost under equally pointless circumstances. Good to see you too, Jason. The Council's waiting to hear an explanation. Forgive me for not attending, but I have to try to salvage this debacle. Did I miss something? I thought we saved the dock. That's the problem with you people. You can't think but five minutes in front of you. That EMP knocked out almost every piece of hardware and every APU. If I were the machines, I'd send every sentinel here now. Save the dock, captain? You handed it to them on a silver platter. Come on, get it cut. The bridge is clear. Do you hear that? Get that cable run! - I want the system back online! - It's the dock. They've got incoming. Order everyone to fall back. Seal the shaft. Now. Move it! Oh, my God. - All clear. - Do it. - Go! Come on! Run! - Go! Your move. So you gave them your ship? - That is correct, councillor, I did. - Knowing what he planned to do with it? The Oracle said nothing of this? She told me Neo would need my help, and I would choose to help him or not. But what hope can a single vessel have against their entire defense system? None. It's completely impossible. But he wouldn't listen. He wouldn't even take any ammunition. He was totally out of his goddamn mind. No, he wasn't. Neo is doing what he believes he must do. I don't know if what he's doing is right. I don't know... ...if he'll reach the machine city. And if he does, I don't know what he can do to save us. But I do know that as long as there is a single breath in his body... ...he will not give up. And neither can we. Temperature's dropping. Here we go. We're over the fields, aren't we? How do you know that? I can feel them. Over there. There's our path. Can you see it? Three lines. Power lines. Follow them. What are they doing? I don't know. Lieutenant? Goddamn it. What do we do now? It is now a matter of time. The machines will breach the walls of this city. I recommend that the Council join the other non-military personnel inside the temple. How long do we have? Two hours. Maybe less. My men have fortified the entrance with enough artillery to make our last stand. Beyond that, there isn't anything more I can do. Commander, do you think that we have any chance of surviving? If I were you, I wouldn't ask me that question. I would ask him. - Why? - He's the one who believes in miracles. There. Those mountains. That's it. - Do you see what's out there? - Yes. If you tell me we'll make it, I'll believe you. We'll make it. We have to. Sentinels. There's too many! Gotcha! - I need help here! - I can't beat them. - What do we do? - Go up, over them. - What? - The sky! It's the only way. Then up we go. Beautiful. Pump the igniter. The ship will start. Again. Slowly. Now! Trin? Trinity? Trinity? - I'm here. - Where? Here. We made it. You said we would. It's unbelievable, Trin. Light everywhere. Like the whole thing was built of light. I wish you could see what I see. You've already shown me so much. What is it, Trinity? What's wrong? I can't go with you, Neo. I've gone as far as I can. What? Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no. It's all right. It's time. I've done all that I could do. Now you have to do the rest. You have to finish it. You have to save Zion. I can't. - Not without you. - Yes, you can. You will. I believe it. I always have. Trinity. Trinity, you can't die. You can't. You can't. Yes, I can. You brought me back once. But not this time. Do you remember... ...on that roof, after you caught me... ...the last thing I said to you? You said, ""I'm sorry."" I wish I hadn't. That was my last thought. I wished I had one more chance... ...to say what really mattered. To say how much I loved you. How grateful I was for every moment I was with you. But by the time I knew how to say what I wanted to, it was too late. But you brought me back. You gave me my wish. One more chance to say what I really wanted to say. Kiss me. Once more... ...kiss me. Get that ammunition where it belongs! You got one chance to get this right. Get that damn thing mounted! - Hurry. - Let's go, let's go, let's go! Neo... ...if you're gonna do something, do it quick. I only ask to say what I've come to say. After that, do what you want, and I won't try and stop you. Speak. The program Smith has grown beyond your control. He will spread through this city as he spread through the Matrix. You cannot stop him. - But I can. - We don't need you! We need nothing! If that's true, then I've made a mistake, and you should kill me now. What do you want? Peace. What are they doing? What are you doing? Morpheus! And if you fail? I won't. Neo. He fights for us. Mr. Anderson, welcome back. We missed you. You like what I've done with the place? It ends tonight. I know it does. I've seen it. That's why the rest of me is just going to enjoy the show... ...because we already know that I'm the one that beats you. Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson... ...closing in on you? Oh, I can. I really should thank you for it. After all, it was your life... ...that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to end. Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why, why? Why do you do it? Why? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting for something? For more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know? Is it freedom or truth? Perhaps peace? Could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect... ...trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose! And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself... ...although only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson. You must know it by now. You can't win. It's pointless to keep fighting. Why, Mr. Anderson, why? Why do you persist? Because I choose to. This is my world! My world! Wait. I've seen this. This is it. This is the end. Yes. You were laying right there, just like that. And I... I stand here, right here, and I'm supposed to say something. I say: ""Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo."" What? What did I just say? No, no. This isn't right. This can't be right. Get away from me! What are you afraid of? It's a trick. You were right, Smith. You were always right. It was inevitable. Is it over? Oh, no, no, no. No, it's not fair. It is done. It doesn't make sense. He did it. He saved us. He saved us. It's over! He did it! He did it! He did it! It's over! It's over! He did it! He did it! - What is it? What happened? - Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it. - Did what? - He ended the war. The machines, they're gone. The war is over, sir. The war is over. Zion! Zion! Zion, it's over! It's over! The war is over! The war is over! I have imagined this moment... ...for so long. Is this real? Neo, wherever you are... ...thank you. Good morning. Well, now. Ain't this a surprise. You played a very dangerous game. Change always is. Just how long do you think this peace is going to last? As long as it can. What about the others? What others? The ones that want out. Obviously, they will be freed. I have your word? What do you think I am? Human? Oracle! We were afraid we might not find you. Everything's okay now. Look, look. Just look at that. Beautiful. Did you do that? For Neo. That's nice. I know he'd love it. Will we ever see him again? I suspect so. Someday. Did you always know? Oh, no. No, I didn't. But I believed. I believed., I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest! We can talk, sir. - Oh, I see. So it's personal? - No, you intimidate them. Good God, you're a woman. I honestly... I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? - I thought of you as a soldier first. - I'm an airman. You have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh. - Sir, I have a question to ask. - Yes, please. Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models? That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else? You're kidding me with the hand up, right? - Is it cool if I take a picture with you? - Yes. It's very cool. All right. I don't want to see this on your MySpace page. Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace. Come on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don't change any settings. - What's going on? - Contact left! What have we got? Jimmy, stay with Stark! - Stay down! - Yeah. Son of a bitch! - Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun! - Stay here! Whoa! Tony Stark. Visionary. Genius. American patriot. Even from an early age, the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, his first engine. And at 17, he graduated summa cum laude from MIT. Then, the passing of a titan. Howard Stark's lifelong friend and ally, Obadiah Stane, steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder, until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries. With the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era for his father's legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting. Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry by ensuring freedom and protecting America and her interests around the globe. As liaison to Stark Industries, I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot. He is my friend and he is my great mentor. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark. Tony? - Thank you, Colonel. - Thanks for the save. This is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all very much. This is wonderful. Well, I'm not Tony Stark. But if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award. Tony, you know... The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing. He's always working. Work it! Come on! - We should just stay till the morning. - You are unbelievable. - Oh, no! Did they rope you into this? - Nobody roped me into anything! - I'm so sorry. - But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored. Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you, that's great. - So when do we do it? - It's right here. - Here you go. - There it is. That was easy. - I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's okay. Wow! Would you look at that? That's something else. I don't have any of those floating around. We're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something. Okay, you, too. - I don't blow on a man's dice. - Come on, honey bear. There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And... Two craps. Line away. - That's what happens. - Worse things have happened. I think we're gonna be fine. Color me up, William. - This is where I exit. - All right. Tomorrow, don't be late. - Yeah, you can count on it. - I'm serious! I know, I know. Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. There you go. Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark! Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions? - She's cute. - She's all right? - Hi. - Hi. - Yeah. Okay, go. - It's okay? You've been called the da Vinci of our time. - What do you say to that? - Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint. And what do you say to your other nickname? ""The Merchant of Death""? That's not bad. - Let me guess. Berkeley? - Brown, actually. Well, Ms. Brown, it's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals. Rehearse that much? Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime. - I can see that. - I'd like to show you first-hand. All I want is a serious answer. Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy, ""Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."" That's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks. My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero. And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering. Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey. You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life? I'd be prepared to lose a few with you. Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m. The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds. The surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines. High tide will be at 10:52 a.m. Tony? Hey, Tony? You are not authorized to access this area. - Jesus. - That's Jarvis. He runs the house. I've got your clothes here. They've been dry-cleaned and pressed, and there's a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you'd like to go. - You must be the famous Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am. After all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry-cleaning. I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires, including, occasionally, taking out the trash. Will that be all? Give me an exploded view. The compression in cylinder three appears to be low. Log that. - I'm gonna try again, right now. - Please don't turn down my music. I'll keep you posted. You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now. - How'd she take it? - Like a champ. Why are you trying to hustle me out of here? Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago. That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there. Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door. Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive? Larry called. He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no. Is it a good representation of his spring period? No. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked, - not ""spring"" like the season. - So? I think it's a fair example. I think it's incredibly overpriced. I need it. Buy it. Store it. Okay. The MIT commencement speech... Is in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down... They're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes. Deflect it and absorb it. Don't transmit it back to me. I need you to sign this before you get on the plane. What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans? - As a matter of fact, I do. - I don't like it when you have plans. I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday. - It's your birthday? - Yes. I knew that. Already? Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year. - Get yourself something nice from me. - I already did. - And? - It was very nice. - Yeah. - Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark. You're welcome, Miss Potts. Okay. You're good. I thought I lost you back there. You did, sir. I had to cut across Mulholland. I got you. I got you. What's wrong with you? - What? - Three hours. I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair. For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here. Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on. Wheels up! Rock and roll! - What you reading, platypus? - Nothing. Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad. I told you, I'm not mad. I'm indifferent, okay? - I said I was sorry. - Good morning, Mr. Stark. You don't need to apologize to me. I'm your man. Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he... - I'm just indifferent right now. - Hot towel? You don't respect yourself, - so I know you don't respect me. - I respect you. I'm just your babysitter. So, when you need your diaper changed... Thank you. Let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay? Hey! Heat up the sake, will you? - Thanks for reminding me. - No, I'm not talking... We're not drinking. We're working right now. - You can't have sashimi without sake. - You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible. It would be irresponsible not to drink. I'm just talking about a nightcap. Hot sake? - Yes, two, please. - No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any. That's what I'm talking about. When I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize? I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform on got my back! Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out... No, no. You don't have to be like me! But you're more than what you are. Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here? No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me! General. Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation. Thanks. Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries' Freedom Line. It's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it. And it's worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves. For your consideration, the Jericho. I'll be throwing one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more. To peace! - Tony. - Obie, what are you doing up? I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go? It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas. Hey! Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah? Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you? Good night, Tony. - Hey, Tony. - I'm sorry, this is the ""fun-vee."" The ""hum-drum-vee"" is back there. - Nice job. - See you back at base. I wouldn't do that if I were you. What the hell did you do to me? What I did? What I did is to save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left, and it's headed into your atrial septum. Here, want to see? I have a souvenir. Take a look. I've seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs. - What is this? - That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart. That's right. Smile. We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern. - I don't remember. - No, you wouldn't. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits. Where are we? Come on, stand up. Stand up! Just do as I do. Come on, put your hands up. Those are my guns. How did they get my guns? Do you understand me? Do as I do. He says, ""Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer ""in the history of America."" He is honored. He wants you to build the missile. The Jericho missile that you demonstrated. This one. I refuse. Tony! He wants to know what you think. I think you got a lot of my weapons. He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile. He wants you to make the list of materials. He says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free. - No, he won't. - No, he won't. I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark. But they will never find you in these mountains. Look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stark. Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to do something about it? Why should I do anything? They're going to kill me, you, either way. And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week. Well, then, this is a very important week for you, isn't it? If this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up. I need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane. I need a soldering station. I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles. I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools. - How many languages do you speak? - A lot. But apparently, not enough for this place. They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian. - Who are these people? - They are your loyal customers, sir. They call themselves the Ten Rings. You know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process. Okay, we don't need this. What is that? That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don't you go break down the other 11? Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this. Relax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you're still alive? - What do I call you? - My name is Yinsen. Yinsen. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. That doesn't look like a Jericho missile. That's because it's a miniaturized arc reactor. I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart. But what could it generate? If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second. That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes. Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes. - This is our ticket out of here. - What is it? Flatten them out and look. Oh, wow. Impressive. Good. Good roll. Good roll. You still haven't told me where you're from. I'm from a small town called Gulmira. - It's actually a nice place. - Got a family? Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark? - No. - No? So you're a man who has everything and nothing. Relax. The bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology. It allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine. An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great and four times the size of the Roman Empire. But today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons rules these lands. And soon, it will be my turn. What does he want? What do you want? A delivery date? I need him. Good assistant. You have till tomorrow to assemble my missile. Okay? Can you move? Okay, say it again. 41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that's from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right. Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark! Say something. Say something back to him. - He's speaking Hungarian. I don't... - Then speak Hungarian. - Okay. I know. - What do you know? - How'd that work? - Oh, my goodness. - It worked all right. - That's what I do. - Let me finish this. - Initialize the power sequence. Okay. - Now! - Tell me. Tell me. Function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar. - It should be up right now. - Yes. Talk to me. Tell me when you see it. - I have it. - Press Control ""l"". - ""I."" Got it. - ""I."" ""Enter."" ""l"" and ""Enter."" Come over here and button me up. Okay. All right. Every other hex bolt. - They're coming! - Nothing pretty, just get it done. - Just get it done. - They're coming. Make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay? We need more time. Hey, - I'm gonna go buy you some time. - Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan! Yinsen! - Yinsen! - Watch out! Stark. Come on. We got to go. Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We're gonna stick to it. This was always the plan, Stark. Come on, you're gonna go see your family. Get up. My family is dead. I'm going to see them now, Stark. It's okay. I want this. I want this. Thank you for saving me. Don't waste it. Don't waste your life. My turn. Not bad. Hey! How was the ""fun-vee""? Next time, you ride with me, okay? Watch it, coming up here. Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them. Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss? - Tears of joy. I hate job hunting. - Yeah, vacation's over. Where to, sir? - Take us to the hospital, please, Happy. - No. No? Tony, you have to - go to the hospital. - No is a complete answer. - The doctor has to look at you. - I don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger, - and the other... - That's enough of that. ...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now. - Call for a press conference? - Yeah. - What on earth for? - Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first. Look at this! Tony. - We were going to meet at the hospital. - No, I'm fine. Look at you! - You had to have a burger, yeah? - Well, come on. - You get me one of those? - There's only one left. I need it. Hey, look who's here! Yeah! - Miss Potts? - Yes. Can I speak to you for a moment? I'm not part of the press conference, but it's about to begin right now. I'm not a reporter. I'm agent Phil Coulson, with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division. - That's quite a mouthful. - I know. We're working on it. You know, we've been approached already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA... We're a separate division with a more specific focus. We need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape. - I'll put something in the book, shall I? - Thank you. Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down? Why don't you just sit down? That way you can see me, and I can... A little less formal and... - What's up with the love-in? - Don't look at me. I don't know what he's up to. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. I never got to say goodbye to Dad. I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions that I would have asked him. I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did. If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability. - Mr. Stark! - Hey, Ben. What happened over there? I had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be. I think we're gonna be selling a lot of newspapers. What direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well. What we should take away from this is that Tony's back! And he's healthier than ever. We're going to have a little internal discussion and we'll get back to you with the follow-up. - Where is he? - He's inside. Well, that... That went well. Did I just paint a target on the back of my head? Your head? What about my head? What do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow? - Optimistically, 40 points. - At minimum. Yep. Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer. Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy. That's what we do. We're iron mongers. We make weapons. It's my name on the side of the building. And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos. Not based on what I saw. We're not doing a good enough job. We can do better. We're gonna do something else. Like what? You want us to make baby bottles? I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology. Come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt! Tony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up! - It works. - Yeah, as a science project. The arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it. Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right? Maybe. Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what? - Thirty years. - That's what they say. Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you? - Never mind who told me. Show me. - It's Rhodey or Pepper. - I want to see it. - Okay, Rhodey. - Okay. - Okay? It works. Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand? There's nothing we can't do if we stick together, like your father and I. I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay? - But if I had... - Tony. Tony, no more of this ""ready, fire, aim"" business. - You understand me? - That was Dad's line. You gotta let me handle this. We're gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now. We're going to have to take a lot of heat. I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low. Stark Industries! I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready? Sell, sell, sell! Abandon ship! Does the Hindenburg ring any bells? Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan! Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons! Pepper. How big are your hands? - What? - How big are your hands? - I don't understand why... - Get down here. I need you. Hey. Let's see them. Show me your hands. Let's see them. Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed. I just need your help for a sec. Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive? It was. It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump. - Speed bump, what does that mean? - It's nothing. It's just a little snag. There's an exposed wire under this device. And it's contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short. It's fine. - What do you want me to do? - Put that on the table over there. - That is irrelevant. - Oh, my God! I want you to reach in, and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out. - Is it safe? - Yeah, it should be fine. It's like Operation. You just don't let it touch the socket wall or it goes ""beep."" - What do you mean, ""Operation""? - It's just a game, never mind. - Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great. - Okay. You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this. No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great. Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm... - Okay, okay. - I really need your help here. Okay. Oh, there's pus! It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, - not from my body. - It smells! Yeah, it does. The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it? - Okay, I got it! I got it! - Okay, you got it? Now, don't let it touch the sides when you're coming out! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's what I was trying to tell you before. Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, you don't... There's a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out. - Oh, God! - Okay, I was not expecting... - Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in! - Okay, what do I do? What's wrong? Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest 'cause you yanked it out like a trout... - What? You said it was safe! - We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this. - You gotta switch it out really quick. - Okay. Okay. - Tony? It's going to be okay. - What? - Is it? - It's gonna be okay. - I'm gonna make this okay. - Let's hope. Okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate. Make sure you... Was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here. Nice. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I feel great. You okay? Don't ever, ever, ever, ever ask me to do anything like that ever again. I don't have anyone but you. Anyway... - What do you want me to do with this? - That? Destroy it. Incinerate it. You don't want to keep it? Pepper, I've been called many things. ""Nostalgic"" is not one of them. - Will that be all, Mr. Stark? - That will be all, Miss Potts. Hey, Butterfingers, come here. What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk? That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad. Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff. The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned? I'll tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot's instinct, his insight, that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgment. Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane? Look who fell out of the sky. Mr. Tony Stark. - Hello, sir. - Speaking of manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987. - That lovely lady you woke up with. - Don't do that! - What was his name? - Don't do that. - Was it Ivan? - Don't do that. They'll believe it. Don't do that. - Okay. - Don't do that. - Pleasure meeting you. - Give us a couple minutes, you guys. - I'm surprised. - Why? I swear, I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon. I'm doing a little better than walking. - Really? - Yeah. Rhodey, I'm working on something big. I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it. You're about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy, 'cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was a doozy. This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different. What? You're a humanitarian now or something? - I need you to listen to me. - No. What you need is time to get your mind right. - I'm serious. - Okay. It's nice seeing you, Tony. Thanks. - Jarvis, you up? - For you, sir, always. I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two. Shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database? Actually, I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server? Working on a secret project, are we, sir? I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good. Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don't even move. You are a tragedy. Okay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter, and back and center. Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Okay. Activate hand controls. We're gonna start off nice and easy. We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. And three, two, one. Up two. All right, set that. I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom? Yeah, everything's... What? - Obadiah's upstairs. - Great! - What would you like me to tell him? - Great. I'll be right up. Okay. I thought you said you were done making weapons. It is. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless. I didn't expect that. How'd it go? It went that bad, huh? Just because I brought pizza back from New York - doesn't mean it went bad. - Sure doesn't. Oh, boy. It would have gone better if you were there. You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing. - I lay low, and you take care of all... - Hey, come on. In public. The press. - This was a board of directors meeting. - This was a board of directors meeting? The board is claiming you have posttraumatic stress. They're filing an injunction. - A what? - They want to lock you out. Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points? We knew that was gonna happen. - Fifty-six and a half. - It doesn't matter. We own the controlling interest in the company. Tony, the board has rights, too. They're making the case that you and your new direction - isn't in the company's best interest. - I'm being responsible! That's a new direction for me, for the company. I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that... This is great. - Oh, come on. Tony. Tony. - I'll be in the shop. Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen. I'm trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch them. Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs. - No. No, absolutely not. - It'll give me a bone to throw the boys - in New York! - This one stays with me. - That's it, Obie. Forget it. - All right, well, this stays with me, then. Go on, here, you can have a piece. - Take two. - Thank you. You mind if I come down there and see what you're doing? Good night, Obie. Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. All right, nice and easy. Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity. And three, two, one. Okay. Please don't follow me around with it, either, 'cause I feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down! If something happens, then come in. And again, let's bring it up to 2.5. Three, two, one. Okay, this is where I don't want to be! Not the car, not the car! Table! Could be worse! Could be worse! We're fine! Okay. No! Yeah, I can fly. - Jarvis, are you there? - At your service, sir. - Engage Heads Up Display. - Check. Import all preferences from home interface. Will do, sir. All right, what do you say? I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We're online and ready. Can we start the virtual walk-around? Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment. Do a check on control surfaces. As you wish. Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics. Yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check. Start listening in on ground control. Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight is... Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk. Ready? In three, two, one. Handles like a dream. All right, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record? The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir. Records are made to be broken! Come on! Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring. Keep going! Higher! We iced up, Jarvis! Deploy flaps! Jarvis! Come on, we got to break the ice! Kill power. Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude. Hull pressurization is problematic. I'm thinking icing is the probable factor. A very astute observation, sir. Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems. Connect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. - Got it? - Yes. Shall I render using proposed specifications? Thrill me. Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall, where Tony Stark's third annual benefit for the Firefighter's Family Fund has become the place to be for L.A.'s high society. Jarvis, we get an invite for that? I have no record of an invitation, sir. ... hasn't been seen in public since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference. Some claim he's suffering from posttraumatic stress and has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be, no one expects an appearance from him tonight. The render is complete. A little ostentatious, don't you think? What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet. Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there. Yes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete. Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it. Commencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours. Don't wait up for me, honey. Weapons manufacturing is only one small part of what Stark Industries is all about, and our partnership with the fire and rescue community... - Hey, Tony, remember me? - Sure don't. You look great, Hef. We're going to have a great quarter. What's the world coming to when a guy's got to crash his own party? Look at you. Hey, what a surprise. I'll see you inside. Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right? I think I got the board right where we want them. You got it. Just cabin fever. I'll just be a minute. - Give me a Scotch. I'm starving. - Mr. Stark? - Yeah? - Agent Coulson. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the... Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division. God, you need a new name for that. Yeah, I hear that a lot. Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you. There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and time can be a factor with these things. Let's just put something on the books. How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. at Stark Industries? Tell you what. You got it. You're absolutely right. Well, I'm going to go to my assistant, and we'll make a date. You look fantastic! I didn't recognize you. - What are you doing here? - Just avoiding government agents. - Are you by yourself? - Yes. Where'd you get that dress? - Oh, it was a birthday present. - That's great. - From you, actually. - Well, I got great taste. Yes. - You want to dance? - Oh, no. - All right, come on. - Thank you. No. Am I making you uncomfortable? No. No. I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in front of everyone that I work with in a dress with no back. - You look great and you smell great. - Oh, God. But I could fire you if that would take the edge off. I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me. - I'd make it a week. Sure. - Really? What's your Social Security number? - Five. - Five? - Right. - Right. You're missing just a couple of digits there. The other eight? So I got you for the other eight. - How about a little air? - Yes, I need some air. - That was totally weird. - Totally harmless. It was totally not harmless, by the way. We're dancing. No one's even watching. Everybody who I work with... No, you know why? I think you lost objectivity. I think they just... People... We just danced. No, it was not just a dance. You don't understand because you're you. And everybody knows exactly who you are and how you are with girls and all of that, which is completely fine. But, you know, then me, you're my boss, - and I'm dancing with you. - I don't think it was taken that way. Because it makes me look like the one who's trying to... - I just think you're overstating it. - You know, and we're here, and then I'm wearing this ridiculous dress, and then we were dancing like that and... - I would like a drink, please. - Got it, okay. - I would like a vodka martini, please. - Okay. Very dry with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives. Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast. Make one of them dirty, will you? Wow. Tony Stark. - Oh, hey. - Fancy seeing you here. - Carrie. - Christine. That's right. You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you? Panic. I would say panic is my reaction. 'Cause I was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity. Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don't know what to tell you. I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker. I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear. Is this what you call accountability? It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it? - When were these taken? - Yesterday. - I didn't approve any shipment. - Well, your company did. Well, I'm not my company. - Please, do you mind? - Have you seen these pictures? - What's going on in Gulmira? - Tony, Tony. - You can't afford to be this naive. - You know what? I was naive before, when they said, ""Here's the line. We don't cross it. ""This is how we do business."" If we're double-dealing under the table... Are we? Tony, your picture, please! Let's take a picture. Come on. Picture time! Tony. Who do you think locked you out? I was the one who filed the injunction against you. It was the only way I could protect you. No. No. The 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into hell, into a modern day Heart of Darkness. Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages have been driven from their homes, displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power. Villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find in the ruins of other villages, or here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant. Recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters referred to by locals as the Ten Rings. As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission. A mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way. With no political will or international pressure, there's very little hope for these refugees. Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband, who was kidnapped by insurgents, either forced to join their militia... Desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs, holding them up to anyone who will stop. A child's simple question, ""Where are my mother and father?"" There's very little hope for these refugees, refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help. He's all yours. What the hell was that? Were we cleared to go in there? No, they were using human shields. We never got the green light. Put me through to State. They're going to be all over this. Get those monitors up! We got a bogey! - Wasn't Air Force! - We got the CIA on the line? I've got Langley on the line. They want to know if it's us. No, it definitely is not us, sir! - It wasn't Navy. - Wasn't Marines. I need answers! Can I please get eyes on target? - Negative, negative. - Cannot identify. Get me Colonel Rhodes from Weapons Development down here now! We ran an ID check and cross-referenced with all known databases. We have nothing. Any high altitude surveillance in the region? We got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area. So this thing just appeared out of nowhere? How come it didn't show up on the radar? Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir. - Is it stealth? - No, sir, it's tiny. We think it's an unmanned aerial vehicle. Colonel, what are we dealing with here? - Let me make a call. - Sergeant, clear a hole. - Hello? - Tony? - Who's this? - It's Rhodes. - Sorry, hello? - I said it's Rhodes. - Speak up, please. - What in the hell is that noise? - Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down. - Yeah, well, I need your help right now. It's funny how that works, huh? Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few clicks from where you were being held captive. Well, that's a hot spot. Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh? Why do you sound out of breath, Tony? I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon. - I thought you were driving. - Right, I was driving to the canyon, where I'm going to jog. You sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about? - Nope! - Bogey spotted! - Whiplash, come in hot. - Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one right now, and it's about to be blown to kingdom come. That's my exit. Ballroom, this is Whiplash One. I've got the bogey in my sights. Whiplash One, what is it? I've got no idea. - You have radio contact? - Non responsive, sir. Then you are clear to engage. Hit it. That bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock! - Inbound missile. - Flares! Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares! Deploy flaps! Holy! That thing just jumped off the radar, sir. The sat visual has been lost. No way that's a UAV. What is it? I can't see anything. Whatever it was, it just bought the farm. I think bogey's been handled, sir. - Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it's me. - It's who? - I'm sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me. No, see, this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. - You understand that? - This is not a piece of equipment. I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me! Rhodey, you got anything for me? - Mark your position and return to base. - Roger that, Ballroom. On your belly! It looks like a man! Shake him off! Roll! Roll! I'm hit! I'm hit! It's confirmed. He has been hit. Punch out! Punch out! Whiplash One down. Whiplash Two, do you see a chute? Negative! No chute, no chute! My chute's jammed! Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey. Whiplash Two, reengage. If you get a clear shot, you take it. Major, we don't even know what we're shooting at. - Call off the Raptors. - That thing just took out an F-22 inside a legal no fly zone! Whiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it! You've been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver. Keep going! Good chute! Good chute! - Tony, you still there? - Hey, thanks. Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch. You owe me a plane. You know that, right? Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on? No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better. Now, what am I supposed to tell the press? Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS? It's not that simple. An unfortunate training exercise involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday. I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured. As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira, it is still unclear who or what intervened, but I can assure you that the United States government was not involved. Hey! It is a tight fit, sir. Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt. Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off, so... Hey. - I really should be able to... - Please, try not to move, sir. What's going on here? Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing. Are those bullet holes? Welcome. Compliments of Tony Stark. If you'd killed him when you were supposed to, you'd still have a face. You paid us trinkets to kill a prince. Show me the weapon. Come. Leave your guards outside. His escape bore unexpected fruit. So this is how he did it. This is only a first, crude effort. Stark has perfected his design. He has made a masterpiece of death. A man with a dozen of these can rule all of Asia. And you dream of Stark's throne. We have a common enemy. If we are still in business, I will give you these designs as a gift. And in turn, I hope you'll repay me with a gift of iron soldiers. Technology. It's always been your Achilles' heel in this part of the world. Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes. That's the least of your problems. Crate up the armor and the rest of it. All right, let's finish up here. Set up Sector 16 underneath the arc reactor, and I'm going to want this data masked. Recruit our top engineers. I want a prototype right away. Hey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand? I need you to go to my office. You're going to hack into the mainframe and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This'll get you in. It's probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading. And what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here? Same drill. They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them. I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them. Tony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again. There is nothing except this. There's no art opening. There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign. There is the next mission and nothing else. Is that so? Well, then, I quit. You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I'm trying to protect the people that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out? You're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it. I shouldn't be alive, unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right. You're all I have, too, you know. Sector 16? What are you up to, Obadiah? You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark. - As you can see, Obadiah Stane... - Oh, my God. ... your deception and lies will cost you dearly. The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up. So, what are we going to do about this? I know what you're going through, Pepper. Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn't he? I was so happy when he came home. It was like we got him back from the dead. Now I realize, well, Tony never really did come home, did he? He left a part of himself in that cave. Breaks my heart. Well, he's a complicated person. He's been through a lot. I think he'll be all right. You are a very rare woman. Tony doesn't know how lucky he is. Thank you. Thanks. I'd better get back there. Is that today's paper? Yes. Do you mind? - Not at all. - Puzzle. Of course. Take care. Ms. Potts? We had an appointment. Did you forget about our appointment? Nope, right now. Come with me. - Right now? - We're going to have it right now. - Yeah, walk with me. - Okay. I'm going to give you the meeting of your life. Your office. Yeah, we've been working our best to do it. Absolutely, we're... I'm going to have to call you back. Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored what you've asked us, and it seems as though there's a little hiccup. - Actually... - A hiccup? Yes, to power the suit, sir, the technology actually doesn't exist. - So it's... - Wait, wait, wait. The technology? William, here is the technology. I've asked you to simply make it smaller. Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying to do, but honestly, it's impossible. Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps! Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark. Tony? Tony, are you there? Hello? Breathe. Easy, easy. You remember this one, right? It's a shame the government didn't approve it. There's so many applications for causing short-term paralysis. Tony. When I ordered the hit on you, I worried that I was killing the golden goose. But, you see, it was just fate that you survived that. You had one last golden egg to give. Do you really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you? Your father, he helped give us the atomic bomb. Now, what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you? Oh, it's beautiful. Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony. What a masterpiece. Look at that. This is your legacy. A new generation of weapons with this at its heart. Weapons that will help steer the world back on course, put the balance of power in our hands. The right hands. I wish you could've seen my prototype. It's not as... Well, not as conservative as yours. Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this. I would have preferred that she lived. What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed? Pepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah... Okay, where's Tony now? I don't know. He's not answering his phone. Please go over there and make sure everything's okay. Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut. Good boy. Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony! Tony! You okay? - Where's Pepper? - She's fine. She's with five agents. They're about to arrest Obadiah. That's not going to be enough. Section 16. Section 16. There it is. My key's not working. It's not opening the door. Oh, wow! What's that? It's, like, a little device? It's, like, a thing that's going to pick the lock? You might want to take a few steps back. That's the coolest thing I've ever seen. Not bad, huh? Let's do it. You need me to do anything else? Keep the skies clear. Damn! Next time, baby. Looks like you were right. He was building a suit. I thought it'd be bigger. How do you think the Mark One chest piece is going to hold up? The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir. That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight. Keep me posted. Pepper! - Tony! Tony, are you okay? - I'm fine. How are... - Obadiah, he's gone insane! - I know. - Listen, you'd better get out of there. - He built a suit. Get out of there right now! Where do you think you're going? Your services are no longer required. Stane! I love this suit! - Put them down! - Collateral damage, Tony. Divert power to chest RT. Power reduced to 19%. Lady! No, no, no, no, no, no! For 30 years, I've been holding you up! I built this company from nothing! Nothing is going to stand in my way. Least of all you! Impressive! You've upgraded your armor! I've made some upgrades of my own! Sir, it appears that his suit can fly. Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude. With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that... I know the math! Do it! Sir, you're not going to believe this. That thing is back. Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets! Not necessary, people. Just a training exercise. Yes, sir. - Thirteen percent power, sir. - Climb! - Eleven percent. - Keep going! - Seven percent power. - Just leave it on the screen! Stop telling me! You had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way! How'd you solve the icing problem? Icing problem? Might want to look into it. Two percent. We are now running on emergency backup power. - Potts! - Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay? I'm almost out of power. I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there. Nice try! - Weapons status? - Repulsors offline. Missiles offline. Flares! Very clever, Tony. - Potts? - Tony! This isn't working. We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof. - Well, how are you going to do that? - You're going to do it. Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know. You're going to hit the master bypass button. It's going to fry everything up here. Okay. I'm going in now. Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time. This looks important! I never had a taste for this sort of thing, but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit! You finally outdid yourself, Tony! You'd have made your father proud! It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof! Tony! How ironic, Tony! Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever! - Pepper! - And now I'm going to kill you with it! - You ripped out my targeting system! - Time to hit the button! - You told me not to! - Hold still, you little prick! - Just do it! - You'll die! Push it! Tony! You've all received the official statement of what occurred at Stark Industries last night. There have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned and caused damage to the arc reactor. Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark's personal security staff... ""Iron Man."" That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it. I mean, it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold-titanium alloy, but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway. Here's your alibi. Okay. - You were on your yacht. - Yeah. We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from 50 of your guests. See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me alone on the island. - That's what happened. - All right. Just read it, word for word. There's nothing about Stane here. That's being handled. He's on vacation. Small aircraft have such a poor safety record. But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard? He's my... I mean, is that... That's kind of flimsy, don't you think? This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark. Just stick to the official statement, and soon, this will all be behind you. You've got 90 seconds. Agent Coulson? I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help. That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us. - From the Strategic Homeland... - Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D. Right. - Let's get this show on the road. - You know, it's actually not that bad. Even I don't think I'm Iron Man. - You're not Iron Man. - Am so. - You're not. - All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I'd become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night. - What night? - You know. Are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof, and then you went downstairs to get me a drink, and you left me there, by myself? Is that the night you're talking about? Thought so. - Will that be all, Mr. Stark? - Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts. And now, Mr. Stark has prepared a statement. He will not be taking any questions. Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop... I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, - despite the fact that you... - I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero. I never said you were a superhero. Didn't? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, - largely public. - Just stick to the cards, man. Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is I am Iron Man. Jarvis! Welcome home, sir. ""I am Iron Man."" You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet. Who the hell are you? Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative. Subtitles by LeapinLar, Some things start out big, and some things start out small, very small. But sometimes the smallest thing... can make the biggest changes of all. - Yar, what is it? - I don't know. Plio, get back here! We don't know what it is! Plio, be careful. Dad, get over here. - Zini, it's not safe. - Oh, I always have to go when stuff's happening. Well, what is it? - It was an egg. Look. - What? - It's a cold-blooded monster from across the sea. - Vicious, flesh-eating. - Blech. - Eew. - Looks like a baby to me. Babies grow up. You keep that thing, one day, we'll turn our backs-- It'll be picking us out of its teeth. - Things like that eat things like us as snacks! - So, what do we do? Get rid of it! What has gotten into you? Plio, that thing is dangerous! I'm sorry, little one. - Okay, get rid of it. - Allright. I will. You'd better hurry up, Dad. It looks hungry. Here. - It's okay. - We'll teach him to hate meat. - Hmph. - Watch his head. I-I mean, watch it, he could bite. This monster's got no teeth. What's he gonna do? Gum us to death? Zini, come on. Look at that sweet little face. Does that look like a monster toyou? - Let me out! Let me out! Hair ball. - That was great! Get him! Oh, no! Attacking lemurs! Suri, please! I can't take it! There are too many of you! Come on! Pick on someone your own size! - Help! Oh, no-- Aladar, you're not dead. - No! All right, guys, break it up. Remember the courtship? - You gonna miss seeing all that smooching. -  Oh, Mom. - That's okay, Plio. We can smooch right here. - It's a shame you don't like kids. - Nasty little vermin. Ha-ha. Go find Zini. He's rehearsing pickup lines. Let's hope he's found some new material. Hey, sweetie, if you'll be my bride, I'll groom ya. That is good. Oh, that's good. Girls, I'm known as the ""professor of love"", and school's in session. - Yeah, I still got it.  - I hope it's not contagious. - I'm a raging epidemic of romance. - Come on, hot stuff. Let's get goin'. You don't wanna miss Yar's annual pep talk. Oh, goody. I can't wait to hear the mating advice of an old monkey. Hey-Hey-Hey, I heard that in his day, that old monkey was quite a swinger. - You talkin' about Yar? - Yeah, to hear him tell it, he put the ""prime"" in ""primate"". Really? Okay, boys, gather 'round. Listen and learn from the master. Now, girls, don't jump into the trees after the first boy with a cute back flip. It's more fun if you keep them guessing. And if a cute back flip doesn't work, guess. You're never going to forget this day, so make it one to remember. But if you mess up, don't worry. They'll never remember. Come on, guys! We don't wanna let 'em down! - Go on, now. Chest up! Chin up! -  Whoo! - Make 'em look good, son. - Come on, Yar. - My charm and your brains? No problem. Ha-ha! - Hey, girls, look what just pulled into town. -  Hey, ladies! - Your buffet table of love. - Right here!Right here! - Hey, beautiful! Hey, free samples! Get me while I'm hot! Whoa! Zini. - Whoo! Wah-hoo! -  Whoo! - Yah-hoo! - You're missin' all the action, pal. Come on. Hey, haven't you heard? I am the action! Ah, don't worry, Zini. You always have next year. Hey, I'm lucky to be rid of them. With the ladies, - before you know it, they all wanna move to a bigger tree. - Hmm. Oh, well. Poor Zini. The clan still has one bachelor. No, we have two. Well, it's never really been his best event. He's got a tougher hide than mine. - Oh, Aladar, if only there was someone on the island for you. Well, you know, who looks like you, but prettier. Come on, Plio. What more could I want? Whoa! - What are they? - I don't know. Dad? Something's wrong. Aladar, where's Suri? - She's up in the tree. Come on! Go! Go! Come on! -Mom! - Suri! - Mom! Mom! - Suri! - Mom! -  Suri, where are you? Run, Aladar! Run! Run! - Yar, come on! - Zini, jump! Jump! -  Zini, jump! - Hold on! Plio! Yar! Where are you? Aladar, over here! I feel bad. I feel bad. Oh, Suri. Easy, easy. They're all gone. - Shh, shh. I'm here. Come on. We can't stay here. Now, now, Suri. There's nothing to be afraid of. - Look! - Whoa! - Did you see that? -  What? -  I did. -  Me too! -  Where did it go? - I don't know. Let's go see. - Leave it alone. Hey! -  Shh, Dad. -  It's scaring Suri. -  No, it's not. Everyone just be quiet. -  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! -  Yar, grab on! -  I can't reach! -  Aladar, they're stopping! - Huh? Stay out of my way! You heard Kron. Move it! - Watch it. -  Zini, get your head down. Walkin' backwards, huh? Well, let me know if that gets you there any faster. Keep those little legs movin; Url, or you'll get left behind. Look at all the Aladars. - If you're even thinking of joining them-- - Hang on! Hang on! -Kron, there is a more protected spot further down the-- - We'll rest here for the night. Go ahead, Bruton. Oh, Eema, I wish we were at your nesting grounds now. All this pushing and shoving about, just for a place to sleep. I'm not used to this kind of behavior. - Baylene, you got big feet. Just give 'em a kick. Git! Ooh, I couldn't possibly. Shoo, shoo. Will you come on, Baylene? You wanna get to the nesting grounds alive? - Show some backbone. - Hey, there. - Oh, sorry about that. Uh, it'sjust, we overheard you talking, and, um-- Well, my word. Look at Uri. - He doesn't normally warm up to strangers so fast. - What an unfortunate blemish. - Good mud bath'd clear those right up. - Excuse me? Um, he's my grandfather, couple of times removed. Try a couple of species removed. Uh, my name's Aladar. This is my family. We're all that's left. Oh, my dear. I'm so sorry. Baylene's the last ofher kind. Finding stragglers like her all along the way. I heard you say something about nesting grounds? It is the most beautiful place there is, child. It's where the herd goes to have their babies. Will we find anybody that looks like us there? Oh, the last few days, I've seen 'em all shapes and sizes. Who knows what we'll find. The hard job now is just getting there. - And we're being driven unmercifully. - By who? Kron, the herd's head honcho. We can hardly keep up. An older woman like myself-- It's-- Well, it's positively indecent. - Then tell him. What's the worst he can do? Oh! - Hey! What's his problem? - That's him, honey. Kron. - Huh. - Uh, excuse me! Kron, you got a second? - Get lost, kid. - Hmm. Relax, Bruton. - Who are you? - Uh, Aladar. Why aren't you uphill with the-- uh, young bloods? - Well, I was back here talking to these guys. - I guess they-- They're having a hard time keeping up. - So, you know, maybe you could slow it down a bit? Hmm. Let the weak set the pace. Now, there's an idea. Better let me do the thinking from now on, Aladar. - Hey, they need help back here. - Hmm. Watch yourself, boy. Don't worry. That's how my brother treats newcomers, no matter how charming they are. You sure know how to catch a girl's eye, there, stud. I wouldn't be catchin' nobody's eye if I was you, especially Neera's. You just keep your head down, and you mind what Kron tells you. Since when do we take orders from the likes of him? Kron has swatted flies bigger than you, pops. I could hold that monster's brain in the palm of my-- No, Yar, she's right. Better to keep our heads down with this bunch... - than get 'em bitten off by those things. Well, you just consider yourself lucky that's all that's following us. - Hey, wake up. - Enough with the beauty sleep. You're ravishing already. Hey! Hello! Anybody in there? Zini, what are you doing? I believe you left a wake-up call for the dawn of time. - Come on! Move it! - What's the hurry? Something's up. The herd's gathering without us. Let's check it out. Rise and shine! Kron says everybody goes. - Come on. Get up. On your feet. Huh. The charm never stops around here. You say something? Uh, no-- no, sir. Unless you got a death wish, you and that little parasite better get moving! Sheesh, is that guy ugly or what? Hey, hey, hey, there's your girlfriend. - What are you talkin' about? - You know what I'm talkin' about: Neera. Scaly skin. Yellow eyes. Big ankles. Yeah, I made a real impression on her. What you need is a little help from the love monkey. - ""The love monkey""? - Ow, baby! Ow! - That, children, - is what's known as a ""jerkasaurus"". - And with that, the ice is broken. We've got a lot of first-timers here. Make sure they get it. We stop for nothing and no one. If this is your first crossing, listen up. - There is no water till we reach the other side. And you'd better keep up, 'cause if a predator catches you, you're on your own. Move out! -  Oh, my goodness. - It looks like a very long walk. -And hot. If you smell somethin' sizzlin', it could be me. We're moving too slow. I'll pick up the pace. Hey, old girl, you're wandering off a bit. That's all I need: a monkey on my back. - On your feet, Eema. We can't let those things eat you. They're out there waiting. - The lake! -  We made it? It's just over that-- that hill, baby. Oh, thank goodness. Come on, Eema. Water. Remember water? Oh, it's time to refresh my memory. I'm just gonna walk right into that lake... - until the water's up tomy eyeballs... and soak it all in. Maybe the rains collected somewhere else. What do you want us to do? Take a scout and check the entire perimeter. - Enough! You have to be strong now. The nesting grounds are only a few days away. Keep moving! - Kron, we've never gone this long without water. If we keep going like this, we'll lose half the herd. Then we save the half that deserves to live. What? They're moving already? Oh-Ho, we'll never keep up. There was water here, always water here before. We always had water, always. - And-- And plenty of mud.  - Oh, Eema, please. The herd won't wait. We must carry on. - You gotta get up. - There was water everywhere. - There is no water, dear. - Baylene, don't move. - What is it? What's wrong? - Doyou hear that? - I sure do. Lift your foot, Baylene. Ooh! - Now press down. I always did like big girls! - Water! - Oh, my goodness! - Water! Come on! - He found water. That's it, Eema. Come drink. Kron, look. All we had to do is dig, and-- Good. Now, get out of the way. Wait! Wait! There's enough for everyone! Ah! - Oh. - Eema! That's it. Keep pushing and shoving. That's very helpful. Bruton, we've been walking in circles. There's no water here. - I think we should get back. - Shh. Keep it down. - Let's get out of here. Now, you come out on three. One, two, three! Come on. Come on out. No one's gonna hurt you. Hey, hey. What's going on? The little Aladars haven't had anything to drink. I think they're scared of me. Who wouldn't be? You are pretty scary. -  Come on over, guys. - Take it easy. Don't worry. She's just a hair ball. - And proud of it. Come on. He's gonna find you some water. Here. Now, you just take a foot and press. - Whoa. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Come on. Knock it off. Let's work together here, huh? A little teamwork. Ready? One, two, three. Press! Good job, Suri. - So, where are your parents, anyway? -A lot of us are on our own now. You like kids, I see. - Well, the skinny ones can be a little chewy. I'm Aladar... the ""jerkasaurus"". Ohh. Sorry about that. You're probably right. -  Dad, wake up. -  Huh? Why did you help that old one? What else could we do? Leave her behind? Oh. You mean, you actually-- Well, that happens all the time. - You don't survive if you're not-- - Strong enough. Well... yeah. Is that you talking, or your brother? Everything's so different. I-I don't know what to think anymore. Look, Neera-- we watch out for each other, we all stand a chance of getting to your nesting grounds. - You sound so sure. - I'm not, but it's all I know. So, um-- Oh, water. I'll, uh, get you some water. - Can I try it? - Sure. Just press. - Hmm. -  Oops. - Sorry. - No. You-- You first. One down... and, well, one down. Kron! - Carnotaurs! - What? They never come this far north. The fireball must've driven them out. You led them right to us! Maybe you can feed them with your hide! Move the herd out, double-time! - What's happening? - My brother's moving the herd. Kron, what's going on? Carnotaurs. If we don't keep moving, they'll catch up to us. But the others in the back-- They'll never make it. They'll slow down the predators. You can't sacrifiice them like this! - Hold it! That could be you back there! Or you! If you ever interfere again, I'll kill you. Stay away from him! Ooh. Aladar, no. You just--just go. I'll be okay. Let's go! Let's go! Carnotaurs! - Carno-what? -Carnotaur. A mouthful of teeth with a bad attitude. Let's go. Come on, you guys! Get on! Get on! We're gonna get left behind. Let's go! Hurry up! We're losing them! Aladar, slow down. Oh, joy. Blisters. I've got blisters on my blisters. - You don't wanna know where I got blisters. - What was that? - It came from up ahead. - Okay, what's the worst thing it could be? - A carnotaur. - What's the second-worst thing it could be? - Two carnotaurs! Oh! - That's it. I'm gone. -  Oh, my goodness! Everybody, we don't know for sure. It could be the herd. - Let's check it out. - Oh, my goodness. Goodness gracious. Oh, it's Bruton. It appears we weren't the only ones left behind. - What happened? - Carnotaurs. We should keep moving. - We can't just leave him here. - We can if we move fast enough. Hey, you don't look so good. Let me help you. Save your pity. I just need some rest. Now, get away from me. - Suit yourself. - Hmm? If you change your mind, we'll be in those caves. Mm. It's dark, but at least it's dry. - I like dry. It's the dark part I'm having trouble with. Ouch! Ooh. Sorry, Url. Sturdy little thing, ain't he? - Ahem. We appear to have a visitor. You coming in or what? What is it with you? At least I know enough to get in out of the rain. Now, come on. On your feet. - Uh, you can lie down with us. It's warmer. May I remind you that he's one of them ? Well, looks like he's one of us now. Ahh. Who booked this trip, anyway? Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds soon enough. Well, when I get there, I'm gonna give Kron a piece of my mind. - You tell him, Eema. If I could sleep that deep, I'd be in paradise. If you could sleep that deep, honey, you'd be dead. This plant grew on our island. It will make you feel better. Ahh. Why is he doing this? Pushing them on with false hope? It's hope that's gotten us this far. But why doesn't he let them accept their fate? I've accepted mine. - And what is your fate? - To die here. It's the way things are. Only if you give up, Bruton. It's your choice, not your fate. Well, the plant will help. -Shh. Carnotaurs. - What do we do? - Wake the others. Oh. - Ooh. -  Go! Go! Hurry! Move it, Eema! Oh! -  Aladar! Aladar! Oh, no! - I'll hold them off!. You help the others! Bruton! Bruton! No! Bruton! You did what you could. It's okay, little ones. We're going to make it. Okay, okay. Let's do it again. Let's do it again. - Uh, I spy with my little eye-- - A rock. You got it again! Ooh! You are good! Well, I'll tell you what I spy. A dead end. - What do we do now? - I guess we just go back. Hold on a moment. - Zini, what is it? - Do you smell that? -  Yeah. Get a load of that. -  Good show. Everybody stand back. We're outta here! Aladar, look out! No! Aladar, we'll go back. Back to what? It's gone. We're not meant to survive. Oh, yes, we were. We're here, aren't we? And how dare you waste that good fortune by simply giving up? Shame on you. Shame on you! Shame on you! The worst of it is, you allowed an old fool like me to believe I was needed-- that I still had a purpose-- and do you know what? You were right. And I'm going to go on believing it. And I, for one, am not willing to die here. Oh, dear. The nesting grounds. It's-- It's untouched. Our new home. - And it comes with a pool! - Yodelay-yodelay- yodelay heehoo Cannonball! Whoo-hoo-ha-ha! Ha. Amateur. Look out below! - Not bad. But I don't get it. Where's the herd? - Not to mention Neera. They'll get here-- Mm. Soon enough. Oh, no. Eema? - I spoke too soon. - What is it? That is the way we used to get in here. They'll never make it over that. Aladar, wait! Wait! Kron'll eat you alive. Let him try. Mm. I hope Kron's in a listening mood. Stay here. We'll find a way around it. In the morning, we'll climb it. We have to keep trying. Our survival, our future, is over these rocks. Now, let's go home! You'll make it, won't you, boys? - No. - Watch them. They're tough! If they can do it, so can you! - Kron! Get the herd out of here! A carnotaur is coming! - Keep moving! -Stop! - I've been to the valley! There's a safer way! - Go on! Show 'em! - Kron, listen to him. - Look, we gotta go now! - Go where, straight to the carnotaurs? If we hurry, we can get around them! You can't get over those rocks! There's a sheer drop on the other side! You're gonna kill the herd! I know a way to the valley, and everybody can make it! - Now, follow me! - Kron! They're staying with me! All right. Let's go! Neera! He's led that monster right to us! This way! - No! Don't move! If we scatter, he'll pick us off!. Stand together! Kron! - No. No. Kron. Welcome home. Move over, everybody. Bringing in babies is what I do best. I'd say it's been a few years since you've hatched an egg. - You're right, so let me practice on your head. Look! Somebody wants to meet you. Ohh! Aren't you the sweetest little small fry I ever did see? Hey, little guy. He looks just like me. Meet your dad. He's not as crazy as he looks. -Ohh. Oh, happy day. - Well done, little one. Come here, you little rascal. Let me get a good look at you. Yep. You're your father's son, all right. - Hey! Look what I found! New neighbors! Any of you ladies up for a game of ""monkey in the middle""? - Easy, now! Easy! Hey! None of us really know what changes, big or small, lie ahead. One thing is certain-- Our journey's not over. We can only hope that in some small way... our time here will be remembered., OK, I'll go first. Let me say, we don't really need to be here. - See, we've been married five years. - Six. Five, six years. And this is like a check-up for us. Chance to poke around the engine, maybe change the oil. - Replace a seal or two. - Yeah, that's it. Very well, then. Let's pop the hood. On a scale of one to ten, how happy a couple are you? - Eight. - Wait. Ten being perfectly happy and one being totally miserable, or... - Just respond instinctively. - OK. Ready? Eight. How often do you have sex? I don't understand the question. Yeah, I'm lost. Is this a one to ten thing? But, because, is, like, one very little, or is one nothing? Because... You know, technically speaking, the zero would be nothing. How about this week? - Including the weekend? - Sure. Describe how you first met. - It was in Colombia. - Bogot. Five years ago. Six. Right. Five or six years ago. ... todas las habitaciones. Hey.  Qu pasa? Vamos, muchachos. Registren los elevadores y los escalones. Anda solo? Papeles. Seora. - Est sola? - No. - No, no, no, no, no. - Est bien. She's with me. Est bien. Abren. Sus papeles. I'm Jane. - John. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - To dodging bullets. - Dodging bullets. So it speaks. But does it dance? Hiya, stranger. Hiya back. I think room service fled. I did what I could. Thank you. Oh, that's good. I hope so. I had to milk a goat to get it. Hey, step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Try your luck. How about you, little lady? Wanna try your luck? Win a prize? Yeah, all right. - Two. - We got two over here. - You know how to hold it? - Step right up, have a shot. - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. - You gotta aim it. - I am. Don't laugh, I'll kill you. You didn't blink. Do we still get something? Beginner's luck. - I want to go again. - Going again. Where'd you learn to shoot like that? Beginner's luck. Stop. Stop, you've only known the girl for six weeks. I'm in love. She's smart, sexy. She's uninhibited, spontaneous, complicated. She's the sweetest thing I've ever seen. I knew Gladys two and a half years before I asked her to marry me. You have to have a foundation of friendship, brother. The other stuff fades. Hi. So you don't think this is all happening a little fast? You know I never do anything without thinking it through. - What does he do? - He's in construction. Big-time contractor. A server goes down on Wall Street. She's there, anytime, day or night. She's like Batman for computers. He's gone as much as I am, so it's perfect. I give the whole thing six months, tops. Eddie? I asked her to marry me. What? - I'm getting married! - What? I can't hear you. - Getting married. - I can't hear. - Stop hitting him, he said something crazy. - I'm getting married. - Gotta get these filters changed. - What did you think of Dr Wexler? His questions were a bit wishy-washy. Yeah. Watch your arm. Not the most insightful. And his office is clear across town. Well, you know the four o'clock means we hit rush hour. Not crazy about that. - So that's settled then, yeah? - OK. OK. Dinner's at seven. Yup. I'll be there. Here. Anybody calls, I'm in with the boss. OK? Got a call from the man. Big highline assignment, Steve. You know how it is. Actually, you probably don't. Sweetie? Could you grab me a coffee? I like it with lots of sugar. Thanks a lot. Hey there. And where do you think you're going? Well, I was... The boss wants to see me. Well, he sees you. Look, kid, people who've been working here for 25 years have never seen inside of that elevator. Here. This is the assignment? Now get outta here. - Hey, babe. - Perfect timing. It's pissing rain out there. Gardener left the lawnmower out. - How was work? - Ah, so-so. Oh, I got new curtains. Did you? Well? What do you think? There was a struggle over the material. This tea sandwich of a man, he got his hands on them first. - But I won. - Of course you did. They're a bit green, so we have to reupholster the sofas and get a new rug. Maybe a Persian. Yeah, or we can just keep the old ones, then we don't have to change a thing. We talked about this. You remember? I remember. I remember cos we said we'd wait. If you don't like 'em, we can take 'em back. OK. I don't like 'em. You'll get used to 'em. Yeah. Zero per cent APR till March. So, part two. Here we are. Only this time, you came back alone. Why did you come back? I'm not sure, really. Let me clarify, I love my wife. I want her to be happy. I want good things for her. But there are times... - Honey, would you just... - Five more minutes. There's this huge space between us. And it just keeps filling up with everything that we don't say to each other. - What is that called? - Marriage. What don't you say to each other? James of the Yukon got three stars. This looks nice. Did you do something new? Yeah? - I added peas. - Yeah, peas. Yeah, it's the green. Sweetheart, will you pass the salt? It's in the middle of the table. - Is that the middle of the table? - Yeah, it's between you and me. - How honest are you with him? - Pretty honest. I mean... It's not like I lie to him or anything. We just... I have little secrets. Everybody has secrets. Jesus! Honey, you scared me. I'm sorry, hon. I was looking for the... You going out? Yes. Some clown crashed a server in a law firm downtown and ended the world, so yes. We promised the Colemans. - I know. - OK. I'll be there. In and out. Just a quickie. Probably feels like you're the only people going through this, but there are millions of couples that are experiencing the same problems. - We got a plane in an hour. - All right. - Who's Al Gore? ""Quotes"", 800. - Prodded about possible insider trading, she remarked on national television, ""I want to focus on my salad."" Ryan? - Martha Stewart. - Martha Stewart? - ""Quotes"" for 1000. - Regarding Mick Jagger's knighthood, he scoffed, ""It's a paltry honour, mate. Hold out for the lordship."" - All right. I'll match you... What the hell? What's this shite? Sorry. Where's the can around here? Chrissake... Take a... Hey, you guys playing poker? - Private game. Piss off. - Could I sit in? You think I could... What part of ""piss off' do you not understand? Guys... Whoa, be a little friendly. I got the cash... Easy, big feller. That's cool, man. You're cool. Lis... Look, see? You see what I'm saying? See what I'm saying? Anyone interested? Nah. Cos I'll clean you out. I understand. Fine. Listen, I want... Those are really nice shoes, man. Jesus! - Here's an empty chair. I could sit here... - That is Lucky's chair. Where's Lucky? I don't see Lucky. - Lucky's not back yet. - Then I'll sit here. Unless... I'm too hot for you. - Solid silver. - Ooh, very sweet. ""To dodging bullets. Love, Jane."" In the pot. Put it in the pot. Oh, he's pulled something. You're in trouble now. - $60, eh? - In. Look at the big man over there! Let's play some poker! - Fives. - He's got 14 different tells! You are bleeding William Tell. - What the hell is this? - Sorry, Lucky. You're done, pal. Thanks for the memories. Oh, you Lucky? No kidding. What is it, kid? You looking for ajob or something? You are the job. Pair of threes. - Have you been a bad boy? - Yes. You know what happens to bad boys? - They get punished. - Ooh, yeah. Punish me. Have you been selling big guns to bad people? Mister Racin? Mister Racin? You OK? Oh, the Colemans. He's down! Taxi? - Hey, hon. - Hey, baby. I didn't hear you downstairs. Yeah, I went to the sports bar. Put some money on the game. Yeah? How'd you do? I got lucky. Welcome, neighbours! - Hi, Susan. - Good to see you, John. - There you go. - Oh, this is wonderful. Thank you. - What a lovely dress. - Thank you very much. So is yours. - Come on, let's go see the girls. - Don't stray too far, guys. You want a Cuban? No, I don't smoke. - Clean body, clean soul, Suzy says. - Ain't that the truth. - You guys have any vices? - Well, you know. - Can I get you a drink? - Yes. Chardonnay, please. - Girls? - Chardonnay. - Daddy! - I'll be up here at the filling station. - ...stock's getting butchered. - Hey, boys. Scotch? - Yes, sir. - It's a bloodbath over there. How'd you make out last quarter? Take a beating? Actually, I got all my dough buried under the tool shed. - So, Chuck got the promotion. - Oh, my God, that is so great. So excited. We can finally put the addition on the kitchen. Oh, shoot. Not again. Shoulda worn a raincoat. You know what? Would... Can you hold her for a second? - What? No... - It's all over the appliqu. - Oh, no, I... - No, please, just... Sure. Seltzer. Aw, she likes you. I liked your dress tonight. It was nice. Thank you. Good morning, Mr Smith. There's trouble in Atlanta again. - That's what I hear. What you got? - I've got your boarding pass, taxi receipts... Get rid of that gum. - You got a tissue? - And your hotel bill. - Thanks. - Don't lose those. Keep them in the envelope. We've got the new specs for the dam. - Great, Louie. I'll check those out. - Here. - Is Eddie here? - The door's unlocked. - Morning, pal. - How you doing? Same old same old. People need killing. Oh, Johnny. Little get-together this weekend at my house. Barbecue, no ladies, dudes only. It's gonna be awesome. Yeah, I'll talk to the missus. You want to use my cellphone? Maybe give her a call, in case you decide to scratch your ass or use the head later. - Make sure she thinks it's OK. - You live with your mother. Why bring her into this? She's a first-class lady. And I don't have to check in with her when I want to do something. She cooks, she cleans. She makes me snacks. I'm the dumb guy? John Smith. - Hello, John. - Morning, Atlanta. Quite the body count this week. We have a priority one, so I need your expertise. The target's name is Benjamin Danz, aka ""The Tank"". He's a direct threat to the firm. DIA custody. They're making a ground-to-air handoff to heli, ten miles north of the Mexican border. I need you to make sure the target does not change hands. ""The Tank""? - I-Temp technology... - Jane Smith confirmed. Stand by for contact. Sorry to interrupt, but we have a situation. You know the competition would love to see us burn. I need you to handle this personally. - Target? - Benjamin Danz. I'm rolling the specs now. We need this quick, clean, and contained. Yes, sir. - Ladies. - Morning. - Morning. - Hello, Jane. Yesterday's op: One kill, one agent in protective custody. - We'll get him out tomorrow. - Two cases of G-40s. - The grenade launchers are here. - Order more. All right. Go, Jas. The target's name is Benjamin Danz, aka ""The Tank"". - You serious? - Yeah. He's being moved across the border to a federal facility. The only point of vulnerability is just south of the border. I want GPS and SAC of the canyon, and the weather report for the last three days. He'll rendezvous with the helicopter at a deserted airstrip. We've one chance to strike. Oh, look. More desert. - Are we green? - Perimeter is armed. We are up and running. Red team, red team, this is Broadway Joe. Half-time is approaching. Copy that, Broadway Joe. Oh, come on... - You getting this? - Affirmative. Is it a threat? Countdown's initiated. The convoy is not in the zone yet. An idiot's in the field. He'll blow the charges. OK. You gotta be kidding me. Civilians. Let's get a tune out of this trombone. Picking up a weapon signature. Shit. Not a civilian. Aw, man... Asshole. Countdown is initiated. You should so not be allowed to buy these things. Abort! I think I got ID'd on that hit. You ever been ID'd on a hit? - Not that I'm aware of, no. - Right. I'm in trouble. - You get a look at him? - Little thing. Buck ten, buck fifteen tops. Maybe he's Filipino. I'm not even sure it was a him. You saying that you had your ass handed to you by some girl? I think so. A pro. Well, it shouldn't be that difficult. I mean, how many chicks are hitters out there? - You guys want any dessert? - What do you have, honey? - Ice cream. - Delicious. What flavours? - Chocolate and vanilla. - I don't like those. But mixed together, that could be nice, you know what I mean? And not just the little pink spoon, I like the whole sundae. - That could be arranged. - Perfect. ""Could be arranged."" You hear that? I'd like to have her kick my ass, know what I mean? - Any other details besides her weight class? - Laptop. Sorry? You're in a whole zone right now... - Laptop. - OK, laptop. I want to know who that bitch is. Get me that tape. - Jane. - Get me that tape. - What? - It's Father. The FBI secured the package. The window's closed, sir. - I told you we couldn't afford mistakes. - There was another player. We do not leave witnesses. If this player ID'd you... You know the rules. You have 48 hours to clean the scene, Jane. Looking forward to it, sir. All right, we have a new target. Let's find out who he is. Jesus... What did you do to it? Put a campfire out with it? Buy a new one. This one has sentimental value for its owner. - Who's that? - Well, Gwen, I'm just hoping you can tell me. So, why you gotta know so bad, anyway? You know, just trying to return some lost property. - Hey, Phil. - Hey, John. - You a vegan? - No. My girlfriend is. Here we go. Upgraded RAM module. Chip's Chinese. Imported by Dynamix. Retailed by... You know, I might be able to get you a billing address. All right? No name, just an address. 570 Lexington Avenue, Suite 5003. New York. You know the place? Sweet Jesus! Mother of God... Why don't you both go make some coffee? Jane, it's your husband. He's back from Atlanta and he wants to know about dinner. Tell him... Dinner's at seven. Hi, John. Yeah, she says dinner's at seven. It always is. Perfect timing. As always. - This is a nice surprise. - I hope so. - You're home early. - I missed you. I missed you, too. - Shall we? - Yes. - Thought these were for special occasions. - This is a special occasion. Pot roast. My favourite. Allow me, sweetheart. Been on your feet all day. Thank you. Sure. So how's work? Actually, we had a little trouble with a commission. - Is that right? - Yeah. Double booking with another firm. - Green beans? - No, thank you. You'll have some. Well, I hope everything worked out OK. It hasn't yet. But it will. Pot roast is my favourite. Sweetheart, could you pass the salt? Tried something new? How was Atlanta? Had a few problems ourselves. Some figures didn't add up. - Big deal? - Life or death. Wine? - I got it. - I'll get a towel. Janie? Honey? Jane! Jane! How could I be so stupid? Jane! Jane! Oh, dear God... Wait. No, no. Accident. Honey? Accident. Jane, stop the car, now. Jane? You're overreacting. Let's not get carried away. We don't want to go to sleep angry. We can talk this out. God! Pull over. Pull over! Pull over! Now, look... We need to talk! - OK, I'm coming. Who is it? - Open up. - What the hell happened to you? - My wife. - She tried to kill me. - Yes. And you know what? Gladys tried to kill me. Not with a car. At least Jane was a man about it. But they all try to kill you. Slowly, painfully, cripplingly. And then, wham! They hurt you. You know how hurt I used to be? I used to beat myself up. Now I'm great. I got dates all the time. I just woke up from a thing, I'm in my robe. - You live with your mom. - I choose to. Because that's the only woman I've ever trusted. - It's unbelievable. - Look, I know exactly what you're thinking. If she lied about that, what else has she lied about? I mean, herjob is a spy, to get information from people. French Riviera. A yacht. An Iranian prince. She's supposed to get close to him and gain his trust. It's disgusting. What? What are you saying? What? Your husband is the shooter? That's impossible. Really? This was probably planned from the beginning. Operation Stakeout Johnny. A six-year stakeout to get information from you. Mission accomplished. OK. Here's the upside. - You don't love him. - No. You'll kill him, and nobody's better at that than you are. - Thank you. - And then it'll be over. Lookit, I know you're embarrassed, but it's Eddie you're talking to. The guys we work with, they don't know, I'm never gonna tell 'em. The people she works with probably got a big laugh over this, but that's not important. Lookit, it's like 150 pages of a book have been written. In the first 150 pages, Johnny's been a clown. Well, you can write the last ten pages. You been smoked, but you can write the last ten. Great talk, man. We should do it more often. It was great, I'm proud of you. - I'm gonna borrow this. - I like where your head's at, man. - I'll do it in the morning. - Yeah. - You OK? - Yeah. - OK. Good night. - Night. You don't love him. - Night, Johnny. - Night, Eddie. Good night, Mom. OK, girls. Let's go. Pocket litter, receipts, matchbooks. You know the drill. This is nice. Who picked this out? - What is this? - It looks like your wedding. - I know what it is. What are you doing? - Research on the target. This room is wrapped. Thank you. ...to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, till death do us part. I promise. I, John, take you, Jane, to be my lawfully wedded wife, to have and to h... What's going on, Mrs Smith? Garden party, girls. Howdy, neighbour. Wow. I can't believe I've never been in here before. This is great. - Start with the living room. - Oh, yeah. - I love the floors. What are they, teak? - Red oak, Martin. Red oak. And you won the Golf Masters trophy this year. - Again. - Again. That'll be on your mantel next year. Bitch. Target profile is our main priority. Utilise all means necessary. Phone taps. Credit cards. Audio scan civilian frequencies. With what, Jane? You've reached the Smiths. We can't take your call, but leave a message after the tone and we'll get back to you. - And search the database. - For what? John Smith? - Find him. - Jane? What? - I think I found him. - Where? Here. Heat sensor breach in the perimeter. Commence scanning all floors. I told you not to bother me at the office, honey. - Well, you are still Mrs Smith. - Well, so are a lot of girls. Careful. I can push the button any time, anywhere. Baby, you couldn't find the button with both hands and a map. Last warning. You need to disappear. - No. - Now. D sector clear. - You expect me to roll over and play dead? - Should be used to it after five years. - Six. And I'm not leaving. - E sector clear. Anywhere, any time. Intruder detected. - Evacuate plan C. - Evacuation in progress. Evacuation in progress. Evacuation in progress. Evacuation in progress. Chickenshit! Pussy! You tell me you had a shot at her and you didn't take it? We got all this stuff here, and you're trying to tell me you couldn't take her out? Well, now she's a problem for both of us. Now my house is priority one. Just gimme a hand, will you? You're driving me crazy with the tongs and the furnace. You're like an insane man. All right, they gave you 48 hours. What we got left here? - 18 and change. - 18 hours until they close the book on you? - Eddie? Mom, we're on high alert here! I almost killed you right then. - You do not even realise! - Never mind. I am so done playing games with this broad. - You gotta take her out head-on. - Don't tell me how to handle my wife. She's not your wife, she's the enemy. She could be outside now! Eddie. Got it. Now we're talking. Only question is, how much is it to buy a vowel? - Blackbow Realty. - Hi, I'm from I-Temp. Great! How's our new penthouse working out? Well, just fine, thank you for asking. This is security. There's a problem with your elevator, sir. Do you want an engineer to come see what the problem is? Take your time, I'm really quite comfortable. Are you really comfortable? Jane? Is that you, sweetheart? First and last warning, John. Get out of town. You know I'm not going anywhere. Well, so you say. But right now, you're trapped in a steel box hanging 70 floors over nothing but air. - Oh, so this is a trap? - He's in car three. It's never gonna work, honey. It's never gonna work, because you constantly underestimate me. - Do I? - You have no idea who I am. You have no idea what I'm capable of. - Well, back at you, baby. - Let me guess... Shaped charge on the counterbalance cable, two on the primary and secondary brakes? Maybe? - He found them. - Yes, thank you. Did you also get the base charge on the principle cable? Promise to leave town, or I'll blow it. OK. I give up. Blow it. - What? - Go on, blow it. - You think I won't? - I think you won't. OK. Five, four... - Any last words? - The new curtains are hideous. Goodbye, John. - What the hell was that? - What? You said goodbye. The gas! Cut off the gas! Jane? Madame. Thought of a number of lines for this moment. ""Thought I'd just drop in."" ""Hey, doll, thanks for giving me the shaft."" Nice. So what did you decide? I want a divorce. I like it. You proposed to me here, so it has agreeable symmetry. Coat, sir? - May I sit? - No. - Champagne? - No, champagne's for celebrating. - I'll have a martini. - I'm fine, thank you. So what do you want, John? We have an unusual problem, Jane. You obviously want me dead. And I'm less and less concerned of your wellbeing. So what do we do? Do we shoot it out here? Hope for the best? Well, that would be a shame, because they'd probably ask me to leave once you're dead. Dance with me. - You don't dance. - That was just part of my cover, sweetheart. Was sloth part of it too? Think this'll have a happy ending? Happy endings are just stories that haven't finished yet. Satisfied? Not for years. It's all John, sweetheart. Why is it you think we failed? Cos we were leading separate lives? Or was it all the lying that did us in? I have a theory. Newly formed. - I'm breathless to hear it. - You killed us. Provocative. You approached our marriage like ajob, to be reconned, planned and executed. And you avoided it. What do you care, if I was just a cover? Well, who said you were just a cover? - Wasn't I? - Wasn't I? I have to... Excuse me. No exits up there, Jane. Be cold, John. She's a liar. Be super cold. Come on, madam, this way. Do you know that you're ticking? Get back! Limo, sir? Jane Smith. - That's the second time you tried to kill me. - It was just a little bomb. I'm going home to burn everything I ever bought you. I'll race you there, baby. You there yet? First time we met, what was your first thought? You tell me. I thought... I thought you looked like Christmas morning. I don't know how else to say it. And why are you telling me this now? Guess in the end you start thinking about the beginning. So there it is. I thought you should know. So how about it, Jane? Hm? I thought... I thought that you were the most beautiful mark I'd ever seen. - So it was all business, yeah? - All business. - From the go. - Cold, hard math. Thank you. That's what I needed to know. OK. Hey, John. Hey, Bill. - Are you all right? - Yeah. OK. Uh, by the way, John, your car is hanging out over the sidewalk here. - Yeah, thanks, Bill. - OK. Have a good night. Good night. Shit. Shit. You still alive, baby? Your aim's as bad as your cooking, sweetheart. And that's saying something. Come on, honey. Come to Daddy. Who's your daddy now? Can't do it. Don't! Come on. Come on! You want it? It's yours. Hi, stranger. Hiya back. - Yeah? - Everything OK? We heard an awful ruckus. - No, everything's fine here. Yeah, it's great. - So you guys are fine? Yeah, couldn't be better. Nice. You guys are... - Suzy, Martin. - Have a nice night. Looks like you're redecorating, it's very... Yeah. Shame about the red oak... Five more minutes, Mom... Tempting. But I don't get out of bed for less than half a million dollars. - That left of yours... A thing of beauty. - You take it well. Thank you. That vacation in Aspen? You left early. Why? - Jean-Luc Gaspard. - Oh, God! - Yeah. - I wanted him. Forget it. You didn't hear me that night the chopper dropped me off for our anniversary dinner. - No. - No? Percussion grenades. I was partially deaf that night. I'm slightly colour blind. - Retinal scarring. - I can't feel anything in these three fingers. Three ribs. Broken eye socket. Perforated eardrum. You ever have trouble sleeping after? - Nope. - Yeah, me neither. Go, go, go. Look out. Move it. Shoes. I was given 48 hours to take you out. Same. Jesus, where's the trust? What do you expect? Why do I get the girl gun? - Are you kidding me? - No. We need a car. Colemans. Guy's had my barbecue set for months. - I was never in the Peace Corps. - What? I really liked that about you. Maybe this honesty thing isn't such a good idea. - I didn't go to MIT. - Really? Notre Dame. Art History major. - Art? - History. - It's reputable. - OK. Fuckers get younger every year. I have to tell you, I never really liked your cooking. It's not your gift. Baby, I've never cooked a day in my life. I-Temp girls cooked. Web of lies! I don't know how you do it Making love Out of nothing at all Making love... I like it. Deal with it. - We got company. - What? Shit. - Baby, hold steady now! - It's called evasive driving, sweetheart. Hold still. This thing's all over the place. How do you drive these things? Honey! - Honey, let me drive. - I got it. Move over. Move. I'm the suburban housewife, sweetheart. - You move. - Fine. Go. - Go. - Go. They're bulletproof. They're bulletproof! I think I should probably tell you. I was married once before. - What is wrong with you? - You're what's wrong with me. - It was a drunken Vegas thing. - That's better. That's much better. Great. Stop it. Go, go, go! - Her name and social security number? - No, you're not gonna kill her. These doors are handy. You know, sweetheart, you're being a bit hypocritical. It's not like you're some beacon of truth. John, my parents... They died when I was five. I'm an orphan. Who was that kindly fellow who gave you away at our wedding? Paid actor. I said I saw your dad on Fantasy Island. I know. I don't even want to talk about it. - You got it? - Got it. - Any time. - I got it. We're gonna have to redo every conversation we've ever had. I'm Jewish. Can't believe I brought my real parents to our wedding. Disgusting. How could you serve this? Ma'am, is it possible to get this reheated? Miss? Miss, I'm talking to you. Excuse me? Jesus, Johnny. - Good morning, Eddie. - Morning. It's good to see you're OK. Tell me you got smart and that you killed that lying bitch. This lying bitch? Guess it was just wishful thinking. - I'm sorry. - Eddie. - Nice to see you, Jane. - Eddie. Eddie! Focus. We got problems. Problems? Crack addicts got problems, my friend. You two are smoked. - Maybe. - Maybe? You got the entire agency gunning for you. Probably her agency, too. - And what about you? Where you at? - Me? Where am I at? I find myself dragging my feet this morning. I think you owe me a little money, anyway. - So what do... - We don't understand each other. But I don't need those looks, OK? I been in his life a long time. - Focus, Eddie, focus. - A long time. I'm pissed off. They blew up my house, they shot at my wife. My own company. If she works for who the street says that she works for... ...you're Macy's and Gimbel's. Then she would be the WE channel, and you would be... Whatever channel competes against the WE channel. Know what I'm saying? The point is simple. Once you guys get off the reservation, that's it. - Then you're off the reservation. - Eddie, how bad? How bad is it? You remember Canada. - Kids' stuff next to this. - That was you? Is that a turn-on? Didn't she try to kill you with a car? A good friend stays out of it. This is the facts. If you two separate from each other, you got a shot. Not a great shot, Johnny, but a shot. You two stay together, you're dead. Unless you can find something they want more than they want you. Found him. He's being held in sub-basement D of the federal courthouse. High security, motion and thermal. Power's on the city grid. This is as far as we go, Jane. - Right. Thanks for everything. - Good luck, baby. ...and this north-westerly blow coming down from the middle of the country... Do you guys mind changing the channel? ...one is moving in now... Nick? Would you please get off your fat ass and change the channel? - I know it's tough. Thank you. - ...tomorrow, that's going to make things... 30 second window. I cut the power, you grab the kid. Simple and clean. Got it? Got it. Tell me, how many? Does it matter? - Should I go first? - OK. I don't exactly keep count, but... I would say... High 50s, low 60s. I've been around the block, but the important thing is... - How? - Some were two at a time. - Honey? - I'm... - You monitoring the perimeter? - I checked the perimeter. - What about the police bands? - I'm on the police bands. - Connected... - This is not my first time. Think we've established that. All right. Turn left. Left, John. Left. You don't need to talk to me like that. OK? Be nice. - Left, please. - I can't go left. See? There is no left. Look. I have straight, or back the way I came. There's no left. Which way do you want? - Just stay there and wait for my mark. - See what I'm sitting in? You see that? - Take your time. - Yeah, all right! Stay. Stay there, wait for my mark. I'll find it. Wait for my mark. Almost there. I don't know what happened. Just hold on. John, what are you doing? What are you doing? Cut the lights on my signal. Now. Kill the lights. - Jane, kill the lights. - What's that? - Where? - Turn 'em back on! Idiot! - Here they come. - Uncuff me. Turn 'em back on. Turn 'em back on! - Turn 'em back on! - All right! - Give me the light! - Shut up! - Nick! - Shut up. Give me a gun. Nick, give me a gun! Zip it! This guy's a wily one. - You didn't wait for my signal. - I improvised. - You deviated from the plan. - Plan was flawed. - The plan was not flawed. - Anal. - Organised. - Jane, 90 per cent of this job is instinct. - Your instincts set off the alarms. - And got the job done. Not The Jane Show... No, it was The John Show. Half-assed. Like Christmas, our anniversary, the time you forgot to bring my mother's birthday present. - Your fake mother's birthday. - You are always the first to break team. You don't want a team, you want a servant for hire. I want someone I can count on. - Jane, there's no air around you any more. - OK, what is that supposed to mean? It means there's no room for mistakes, no mistakes whatsoever. No spontaneity. - Who can answer to that? - Well, you don't have to. Cos this isn't even a real marriage. - Who are you people? - Shut up! OK. So, now I realise you witnessed the missus and I working through some domestic issues. That's regrettable. But don't take that as a sign of weakness. That would be a mistake. Now, tell us what you know. Why do both our bosses want you dead? You underst... Honey. Please? Wrap it up. Maybe it's not a good idea to undermine me in front of the hostage. Sends a mixed message. Sorry. Girls. OK. Where was I? - A mistake on your part. - Shut up. Options. I'm gonna lay out your options for you, OK? Option A... - If I could... - Shut up. Option A. You talk, we listen, no pain. Option B. You don't talk. I remove your thumbs with my pliers. It will hurt. Option C. I like to vary the details a bit, but the punch line is, you die. Benjamin? We're impatient people, Benjamin. Can I get a soda? Or ajuice, or some... A, option A! - Ow, that hurt! - OK, that was a nice shot. What's... You got a spasm? I'm tied up. Why don't you check my back pocket? I'm not the target. You are. Both of you. They found out you're married, so they teamed up and sent you to the same hit. It was ajoint task force, both companies. Two competing agents living under the same roof? It's bad for business. - They wanted you to take each other out. - You were bait. Well, it's entry level. Toehold into the company. Couple hits, they bump me up to a desk. It's pretty cool, actually. - You keep the photo in your pocket? - Was I supposed to frame it? You get rid of it. You burn it. Tradecraft 101. Guess I skipped that day. I guess you skipped the day about not marrying the enemy. You were bait or you are bait? Belt! Belt, belt, dude. Two minutes. One minute. - A little help? - Clear. Clear. My way out is a boat standing by in La Paz. Cargo drop, Atlas Mountains. So what? So at least apart we know what the odds are. Let's just call this what it is. And what it isn't. All right, so it's a crap marriage. All right, I'm a mess, you're a disaster. We're both liars. But you run, you'll always be running. I say we stay and fight. We finish this thing. Then if you want to go, you can go. Well, thank you. What? ""Let's call this what it is."" Jesus Christ... - Stop... - Don't. This is a really good store. - See you in the next life, Jane. - Likewise, John. Sorry. We'll talk about this later. Jesus! - I didn't touch a thing. - Yes, you did. - Sorry about the knife in the... - I don't want to talk about it. - I'll fly. - I'll be bait. I'm going clockwise. Watch my six. Go! Move! How's it look? It's a piece of cake. Watch these, they tend to jam. So watch 'em. You favour your left, sweetheart, so I'll cover right. Damn, that boat in La Paz is looking pretty good right now, isn't it? Well, it rains a lot this time of year. There's nowhere I'd rather be than right here, with you. Shut up. I'm interested in the progress you've made in the last few weeks. Doing all right, aren't we? I'm not gonna lie to you, there were times when I wanted to... - ...kill her, but... - Likewise. - Couldn't take the shot. - That's a good sign. - Who'd have thought? - You have to battle through. - That's marriage, right? - Yeah. Take your best shot, and... - Oh, we redid the house. - We did. Yes, we did. You know there will always be challenges? Threats out there? Yup. But you can handle it together. - So far. - Yes, we can... So far? What is that? - I'm leaving room for the unknown. - So far. And do you feel your relationship styles are more conducive to this... Ask us the sex question. John. Well, that... Ten. Visiontext Subtitles: Paul Burns ENGLISH, Merry. No! No! With a sigh You turn away With a deepening heart No more words to say You will find That the world has changed Forever And the trees are now Turning from green to gold And the sun is now fading I wish I could hold you Closer Merry! Merry! Merry. Merry, it's me. It's Pippin. I knew you'd find me. Yes. Are you going to leave me? No, Merry. I'm going to look after you. Hands off! That shiny shirt, that's mine. It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else. I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats! You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut. The scum tried to knife me. Kill him! That's for Frodo! And for the Shire! And that's for my old Gaffer! Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat. I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig. Not if I stick you first. Sam! Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry. Sorry for everything. -Let's get you out of here. -It's too late. It's over. They've taken it. Sam... ...they took the Ring. Begging your pardon, but they haven't. I thought I'd lost you. So I took it. Only for safekeeping. Give it to me. Give me the Ring, Sam. Sam. Give me the Ring. You must understand. The Ring is my burden. It will destroy you, Sam. Come on, Mr. Frodo. We best find you some clothes. You can't go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin. We did it, Mr. Frodo. We made it to Mordor. There are so many of them. We'll never get through unseen. It's him, the Eye. We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo. There's nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters. Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening. If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it. It's only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes... ...but behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping. Let him stay there. Let him rot! Why should we care? Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom. I've sent him to his death. No. There is still hope for Frodo. He needs time and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth. -We can give him that. -How? Draw out Sauron's armies. Empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate. We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms. Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves. A diversion. Certainty of death... ...small chance of success... ...what are we waiting for? Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait. Oh, I think he will. Long have you hunted me. Long have I eluded you. No more. Behold the Sword of Elendil. The city has fallen silent. There is no warmth left in the sun. It grows so cold. It's just the damp of the first spring rain. I do not believe this darkness will endure. Look, the Orcs... ...they're moving off. You see, Mr. Frodo... ...some luck at last. Move it, you slugs! Come on! Faster! Come along, you scum.... I'll whip you down to the bone, you.... Come on! What have I told you?! Get up! Come on, you slugs! You two are going straight to the front line! Now, move it! Go on! Fall in! Move it! To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it! Don't you know we're at war? Company, halt! Inspection! Sam, help me. Mr. Frodo! Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up! It's so heavy. Oh, no. What do I do? What do we do? -Hit me. -What? Hit me, Sam. Start fighting. Get off of me! Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot. Get off of me! Break it up! Break it up! Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't shut this rabble down! Go, Sam. Now! Move along, scum! Back in the line! You maggots! Get back into the line, you slugs! Dig it, you slugs. Move it. Move it! I can't.... I can't.... I can't manage the Ring, Sam. It's.... It's.... It's such a weight to carry. It.... Such a weight. We're going that way. Straight as we can. There's no point carrying anything we're not sure to need. Mr. Frodo. Look. There is light... ...and beauty up there... ...that no shadow can touch. Take mine. There's a few drops left. There will be none left for the return journey. I don't think there will be a return journey, Mr. Frodo. Frodo, get down! Hide! Frodo! Where are they? Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth! Let justice be done upon him! My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome. Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me? We do not come to treat with Sauron... ...faithless and accursed. Tell your master this: The armies of Mordor must disband. He is to depart these lands, never to return. Old Greybeard. I have a token I was bidden to show thee. Frodo. Frodo. -Silence. -No! Silence! The Halfling was dear to thee, I see. Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain? And he did, Gandalf. He did. And who is this? Isildur's heir? It takes more to make a king than a broken Elvish blade. I guess that concludes negotiations. I do not believe it. I will not. Pull back. Pull back! It's gone, Mr. Frodo. The light's passed on, away towards the north. Something's drawn its gaze. Hold your ground! Hold your ground. Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers! I see in your eyes... ...the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of Men fails... ...when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. But it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields... ...when the age of Men comes crashing down. But it is not this day. This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth... ... I bid you stand, Men of the West! Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an Elf. What about side by side with a friend? Aye. I could do that. Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo? It'll be spring soon. And the orchards will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket. And they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields... ...and eating the first of the strawberries with cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries? No, Sam. I can't recall the taste of food... ...nor the sound of water... ...nor the touch of grass. I'm... ...naked in the dark. There's-- There's nothing. No veil between me and the wheel of fire. I can see him... ...with my waking eyes. Then let us be rid of it... ...once and for all. Come on, Mr. Frodo. I can't carry it for you... ...but I can carry you. Come on! Aragorn. Elessar. For Frodo. Look, Mr. Frodo. A doorway. We're almost there. Clever Hobbits to climb so high! Mustn't go that way. Mustn't hurt the precious. You swore! You swore on the precious! Smagol promised! Smagol lied. Frodo! Eagles. The eagles are coming! Frodo! I'm here, Sam. Destroy it! Go on! Now! Throw it in the fire! What are you waiting for? Just let it go! The Ring is mine. No. No. No! Yes! Yes! Precious! Precious! Precious! Precious! Give me your hand! Take my hand! No! Don't you let go. Don't let go. Reach! Frodo! Frodo! It's gone. It's done. Yes, Mr. Frodo. It's over now. I can see the Shire. The Brandywine River. Bag End. Gandalf's fireworks. The lights in the Party Tree. Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone... ...it would've been her. It would've been her. I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee... ...here at the end of all things. Gandalf? Frodo! Gimli! Now come the days of the king. May they be blessed. This day does not belong to one man... ...but to all. Let us together rebuild this world... ...that we may share in the days of peace. My friends... ...you bow to no one. And thus it was. A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began. And the Fellowship of the Ring... ...though eternally bound by friendship and love... ...was ended. Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey... ...we found ourselves looklng upon a familiar sight. We were home. Hi. Hey, watch the pumpkin. More of the same, Rosie. Good night, lads. How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on... ...when in your heart you begin to understand... ...there is no going back? There are some things that time cannot mend... ...some hurts that go too deep... ...that have taken hold. There and back again... a hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins Mr. Frodo? What is it? It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed. ""There and Back Again. A Hobbit's Tale by Bilbo Baggins. And The Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins."" You finished it. Not quite. There's room for a little more. Bilbo once told me his part In this tale would end... ...that each of us must come and go In the telling. Bilbo's story was now over. There would be no more journeys for him... ...save one. Tell me again, lad, where are we going? To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have accorded you a special honour... ...a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth. Frodo... ...any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again? The one I gave you. I'm sorry, Uncle. I'm afraid I lost it. Oh. Pity. I should like to have held it one last time. Well, here's a sight I have never seen before. The power of the Three Rings is ended. The time has come... ...for the dominion of Men. The sea calls us home. I think I'm... ...quite ready for another adventure. Farewell... ...my brave Hobbits. My work is now finished. Here at last, on the shores of the sea... ...comes the end of our Fellowship. I will not say, ""Do not weep""... ...for not all tears are an evil. It is time, Frodo. What does he mean? We set out to save the Shire, Sam. And it has been saved. But not for me. You don't mean that. You can't leave. The last pages are for you, Sam. My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in two. You will have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. Your part In the story will go on. Well... ... I'm back. Lay down Your sweet and weary head Night is falling You have come To journey's end Sleep now And dream Of the ones who came before They are calling From across The distant shore Why do you weep? What are these tears Upon your face? Soon you will see All of your fears Will pass away Safe In my arms You're only sleeping What can you see On the horizon? Why do the white gulls Call? Across the sea A pale moon rises The ships have come To carry you home And all will turn To silver glass A light on the water All souls pass Hope fades Into the world of night Through shadows falling Out of memory and time Don't say We have come now to the end White shores are calling You and I will meet again And you'll be here In my arms Just sleeping What can you see On the horizon? Why do the white gulls Call? Across the sea A pale moon rlses The ships have come To carry you home And all will turn To silver glass A light on the water Grey ships pass Into the West, Mysteries in History, with your host, Peter Graves. Although no one has ever been able to prove their existence, a quasi-government agency, the Men in Black, supposedly carries out operations here on Earth in order to keep us safe from aliens throughout the galaxies. Here is one of their stories that ""never happened"" from one of their files that doesn't exist. 1978. The leaders of Zartha flee their planet in order to escape the clutches of the evil Kylothian, Serleena. - Arriving on Earth, the Zarthans bring- The Light of Zartha, a cosmic force so powerful, that in the wrong hands it could lead to the annihilation of Zartha. The Zarthans' princess, Lauranna, beseeched the Men in Black, to hide the Light from Serleena. But they had no choice. Intervention would have meant the destruction of the Earth. However, in an act of galactic bravery, the Men in Black subdued Serleena, allowing the Zarthans to escape so they might hide the Light on another planet. Serleena, released from her captors, vowed that the Light would be hers, and that she would destroy any planet that stood in her way. And so, never knowing what happened, the people of Earth were saved by a secret society of protectors known as the Men in Black. Harvey! Harvey, get over here! Harvey. Heel, heel! You're barking at the moon, moron. Harvey. Harvey! Harvey! Hey, pretty lady. You taste good. Hey, what the...? Yeah, you too. Nothing fancy, no heroics. By the book. Got it. Hey! Ooh. Hey, Jeff. What's happening, buddy? We were wondering why you're here. The man's talking to you. You know our arrangements. Stay in the E, F and R subway lines and you get all the garbage you want. What the hell are you doing here, worm boy? Uh, Tee. Jeff, uh... Excuse my partner. He's new and he's... - ...Kind of stupid. - Whoa! You getting big, Jeff. Boy, what you been eating? Oh. You like jokes, huh? Jeffrey! Ah! All right. Sweet dreams, big boy. Sweet dreams... ...big boy. Transit authority. Move to the forward car. We got a bug in the electrical system. Yo! People! We got a bug in the electrical system! Now y'all running'? No, no, no! Sit down! It's only a 600-foot worm. Everybody out before I knock heads. Put the hammer down on this thing. I'm Captain Larry Bridgewater. I decide what happens. Oh, oh. You decide? Oh. Okay, come here. Come here. Larry? That's my man, Jeff. Larry just made a decision. Larry need to take his ass in there. Don't make me do this, Jeff! Eighty-first Street. Just a second. May I have your attention, please? We thank you for participating in our drill. Had this been an emergency, you'd have been eaten. Because you don't listen. You're ignorant. How a man gonna bash through...? That's the problem with New Yorkers. ""We've seen it all. A 600-foot worm! Save us, Mr. Black Man!"" I ask you nice, ""Move to the next car."" You just sit there like... Thank you for participating. Hopefully, you enjoyed our smaller, energy-efficient subway cars. Watch your step. You will have a nice evening. I need a cleanup crew at 81st and Central Park West. Revoke Jeff's movement privileges. Have him escorted to the Chambers Street station. And please check the expiration date on the unipod worm tranquilizers. Sorry, fellas. Station closed. Emergency drill. For your safety. Do you believe these putzes? You're welcome. I know, by the book. Tee, when was the last time we just looked at the stars? This is a test. I can do this. Ever feel like you're alone in the universe? Yes. No. Hey, let me buy you a piece of pie. Really? Thanks. Hey, you're not alone in the universe. Remove the arm. Okay. Please, shut up, Charlie. I'm tired of you constantly talking behind my back. You meet a girl. She's into it. The best line you come up with is: ""Wanna come back to my place for some tonsil hockey and egg salad?"" Whoa! Who are you and how'd you get in? You like egg salad? Serleena! Why didn't you say it was you? - Where's the Light? - Here's the deal. You're looking for this Light. We found it. You want it, it'll cost you 50 mill. Here's how it'll work. First... Where is the Light? We couldn't find it, but we found a guy who might know where it is. He runs a pizza parlor on Spring Street. Let's go. And wipe your nose, idiot. Mmm. Oh. Good pie. Yeah. Crowded. Well, they got good pie. What is wrong with you? You're gonna neuralyze me. No, I'm not. You took me here so I wouldn't make a scene. You making a scene. Let me ask you a question. Why did you join MiB? Six years in the Marines. I like the action. Protect the planet. You like being a hero? You joined the wrong organization. You ever heard of James Edwards? No. Well, he saved the lives of 85 people on the subway tonight. No one knows he exists. And if no one knows he exists, how can anyone ever love him? Hey, how long we been partners? Feb 1. Five months, three days. Started at noon. Nine hours. Get married. Have a bunch of kids. Okay. Excuse me. My buddy's kind of shy, but he thinks you are hot. Here it is. Ta-da. Ben, I don't know what to say. Years from now, you know what people'll say? ""Employee"" is spelled wrong? Eh, they charge by the letter. They'll say, ""imagine that. Big shot like her used to work here."" Ben... You deserve it. Bring up a case of Mountain Dew from the basement. Hey, Bruno. Two slices of pepperoni and information about the Light of Zartha. - Whoever you are, don't hurt me. - Where's the Light, Ben? I don't know what you're talking about. Let me down, ma'am. I want to report a robbery... There. Noise. Kitchen! Oh. You idiots see anything? Wind blew the door open. Nothing out of the ordinary. For 25 years, I've traveled the universe looking for it. But it never left Earth, did it? You kept it here. What are you talking about? I'm running out of time. Where's the Light? - I don't know what you mean. - Listen, Zarthan. You hid the Light on Earth. I'll find it. Once we have the Light, Zartha will be ours. You're too late. Tomorrow at midnight, the Light will leave the third planet and be back home. Sorry you made the trip for nothing. Now we don't know if it's on Earth or not. He said third planet. It's here, you idiot. Third Rock from the Sun. I never got that till now. It's on Earth, and I know who's gonna tell me where it is. Don't you ever go home? Nope. I see you neuralyzed another partner. Bee, Dee, when you use a fission carbonizer, attach a de-atomizer so it doesn't sound like a cannon. Hey, get some booties on them things. You're crapping up the floor. Check his visa. The Cephalopods have been making counterfeits at Kinko's on Canal. Why do I have a dead Tricrainasloph going through passport control? That'd be my fault. I'm very sorry. Please don't neuralyze me, sir. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing, sir. Good work in the subway. I remember Jeff when he was yea high. What you got for me? Look. See those guys in black suits? They work here. We got it covered. Zed, what you got? Dedication's one thing, but this job will eat you up and spit you out. You want to look like me when you hit 50... ish? I'll be in the gym if you need me. All right, there was a killing earlier. 177 Spring. Alien-on-alien. Take Tee with you and make a report. Um... Tee. Right. What happened... What happened with Tee... Passports. No rush. How they hanging, Jay? You have got to stop neuralyzing MiB personnel. He was crying in the middle of the diner. I hate that. And plus, you can't count Elle. She wanted to go back to the morgue. I helped her. You need a partner. I'm cool. I'll be his partner. Jay, wait up. I appreciate the shot, man. Thought I'd never get out. Lose the suit. Sure thing. Just going for the look. But if I say so myself, I find it slimming. Not that I've had problems with the ladies. When you get down to... Whoa. Nice sled, very swank. Heated seats? Sometimes I get hives. Frank! Bring your head in this window before I roll it up in there. Got it. Frank! My money? It's missionary. I was in the Bowery, and I meet this Great Dane. A little thick in the body, but pretty. That's just not appealing to me, man. Seriously. I say we do the good cop, bad cop thing. You interrogate the witness and I growl. Grrr! How about we do the good cop, dumb dog thing, and you just shut up? You got it, partner. Total silence. Absolute quiet. Not a word out of me. What do we got? Zip. What do we got? There's residue on the wall. We sent samples to Em for analysis. Hey, Jay, zero percent body fat. Funny. Witness? Girl. Saw everything. She's taking it well. I won't answer any more questions. I want to know what happened here. - I'll handle this one. - You got it. Alone. A talking dog might be a bit much for her now. What do you want me to do? Sniff around. What? Funny. Take a deep breath. Everything is all right. What part is she supposed to feel all right about? I'm Agent Jay. Tell me what you saw. A two-headed guy and a woman. Caucasian? Gray, with tentacles that she used to rip... His skin off. It's not skin. It's protoplasma polymer similar to the gum in baseball cards. What was the last thing you ate? Calzone. What time? Lunch. Spinach? Mushroom. Hm. You need pie. They kept asking Ben about a light. Light of Zartha, something like that. You okay? An hour ago, a man I've known my whole life vanished because of a woman with things coming out her fingers and a two-headed guy with the IQ of a cannoli. So yeah, everything's okay. When we're kids, before we're taught how to think, our hearts tell us there is something else out there. I know what I saw. Tell me what I'm supposed to believe. I'm a member of a secret organization that monitors alien activity on Earth. Ben was an alien. So were his killers. I don't know why they did it, but I promise I'm gonna find out. Okay. Okay? Okay. Okay. Uh... Uh... I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to... Kill me. No! Ha-ha. Just a little flash and everything goes back the way it was. After you flash me, if I see you again, will I know it's you? I'll see you. But you won't see me. Must be hard. Must be very lonely. Excuse me. I gotta go. What about the flashy thing? Uh... I'll flash you some other time. What? Did you tell the girl you love her? She's a witness to a crime. That's it. Yada, yada. You're attracted. She's not my species, and I'm attracted. I should take advice on love from a dude that chases his own ass? Easy, pal. That's canine profiling, and I resent it. Hey, Jay, wait up. Coming through. MiB brass. Look sharp. I'm Agent Eff, Jay's new partner. Who are you eyeballing, huh? Frank, just cool out, dog. Got kids? No. Want them? Get him off me! Talk to me. It's Kylothian, class C. Serleena. Serleena. Old girlfriend? She wishes. The perps were looking for the Light of... Zartha. Yeah, what is it? This makes no sense. It's not on Earth. We took care of this a long time ago. Obviously not. That is very bad news. The Zarthans came to Earth to hide the Light from Serleena. We don't do that. Right. I ordered it off the planet. Well, Zed... I got a Kylothian class C in my park. Are you sure this Light isn't here? Positive. I gave the order. My best agent carried it out. It's as if I gave the order to you. Ask the agent. Can't. Dead? Sort of. He works at the post office. No. If Serleena gets to Kay before we do, he's dead. The Earth's very existence may rest on what Kay knows. Too bad you wiped out his memory of it. Bring him in. Now. How cool is this? Going to get Kay. The legend, the go-to guy. Your mentor, the guy who taught you everything you know. - The greatest agent in MiB history! - Frank! Stop talking. Stay. Listen, partner. I may look like a dog, but I only play one here on Earth. Whatever. Wipe your mouth. Hey, babe. People of Truro, may I kindly have your attention? To facilitate your shipping needs, all packages must be properly wrapped. This one is an example of ""go home and do it again."" I think you know what I mean, Mrs. Vigushin. Heh, heh. Brown paper and triple-twist twine are the preferred media. Thank you for your time. Kay. C. Express mail, two-day air. Kevin. Heh. Wow. Kevin. That's funny. You don't have a ""Kevin""... You don't remember. We worked together. I never worked in a funeral home. Something I can do for you, slick? Straight to the point. You were an agent of an organization that monitors aliens on Earth. We're the Men in Black. We have a situation. We need your help. There is a free mental health clinic on the corner of Lilac and East Valley. - Next. - Excuse me. - Twenty Rugrats stamps. - Elizabeth. The Postal Service hasn't kept up with today's youth, but we have Berlin airlift stamps. Opera legends? No. No. American Samoa? Amish quilts. No. I'm sorry, got a world to save here. There was no coma. It was a cover. Who are you? Who are you? Postmaster of Truro, Massachusetts, and I'm ordering you to leave. Is that decaf? Sorry. We have a breach. Cordon off this area. Full perimeter wipe-down, right here, right now. Get a mop and escort all civilian personnel from this site immediately. Listen to yourself, Kay. Who talks like that? Boo. Why do you think you're so comfortable here? Just about everybody who works in a post office is an alien. No smoking. Kay. My wife and I saw Siegfried and Roy fly a tiger around a room. You're nothing special. When you look at the stars, you get a feeling, like you don't know who you are. Like you know more about out there than you do down here. That's why she left you, Kay. That's why your wife left you. Okay, I'll tell you what. You want to know who you really are, take a ride with me. If not, people are waiting for their TV Guides. Think he'll bite? I'm just going for a ride. If things don't add up, it's hasta luego. Hey, Kay. How's it hanging? Good to see you, Kay. Good to see you too, whoever you are. Well, let's see what you got here, chief. Welcome back, Agent Kay. Agent Kay. Greetings, Kay. Wow, look who's back. I don't mean to bother you... You're Agent Kay! That's what they tell me. This is an honor. Agent Gee. The most respected agent in MiB history. The most feared human in the universe. Maybe I could buy you a cup of coffee? Black, two sugars, if you're going. An honor. - Yeah, I'll take a... My man? - Good to see you, Kay. How'd it go? The Drolacks are gone and the treaty is signed. Good work. What about that position you promised me in Men in Black? Still working on the alien affirmative action program. That's not what you promised me. You're breaking up Zed? Hello? I'll call you back. I could be Agent Em. Zed, you... I think Earth might be in a bad way. You're the only one that could save it. Well, neither rain, sleet, snow... Good man. Get him armed and up to speed and over to deneuralyzation. Frank? Yeah? I'm gonna need them together on this one. Ouch. I need an assistant. It's not field work, but you get dental. Dental? The most advanced technologies from all over the universe are in this room. What's this? All is lost! All is lost! Don't touch that! I didn't do anything. Hands in your pockets. Your favorite weapon. That? Yep. Let's go put it on. What? The last suit you'll ever wear. Again. The... The deneuralyzer. Magneto-energy will surge through your brain, unlocking information that could hold the key to Earth's very survival. Okay. What's that thing? The deneuralyzer. Welcome to planet Earth. There are some rules and regulations. Go out only at night. If you must go out during the daylight, only the East Village. Hey, hey, hey! Name and planet of origin? Sylona Gorth. Planet Jorn. Kaluth system. Any fruits or vegetables? Yeah, two heads of cabbage. Reason for visit? Education. I want to learn how to be an underwear model. They told me I've got real potential. Hmm? Help! Heart attack! Clear! Wake up, champ! Oh, jeez. Lockdown. Code 101. Lockdown. This is not good. This is not good. Breach! We're being flushed. Flushed? Yep. Ever been to a water park? I don't know. Whoo! Heh. Flushed. Heh. Yeah, man, back when you was an agent, you loved getting flushed. Yeah, every Saturday night, you'd be like, ""Flush me, Jay. Flush me."" I'd be like, ""No."" You can't quit on me. I save the world, you tell me why I stare at the stars. Cool. Hop in. Hop in what? Does that come standard? It came with a black dude, but he kept getting pulled over. Yep. Silly little planet. I could rule the place with the right set of mammary glands. Trapped like rats in a Chia Pet. Computer, surveillance MiB. Hmm. MiB is locked down. Computer, magnify. Times 10. Communicator. Frank. - Jay, where are you? - We got flushed. MiB is code 101. Yeah, who did it? Some hot-looking biker chick. Want me to tail her? Stay where you are. I'll be in touch. Stay where I am. Easy for you to say. Find Kay? Neuralyzed. Not active. Civilian. What? He was... Here. To get... Deneuralyzed. Memory's shot. But we'll find him. Don't put anything in our ears. What? What do you make of that? Found it in my pocket. Weird, huh? Yeah, you're smiling. Is that the only deneuralyzer? Officially. The plans leaked out on the Internet. Computer, Internet. Deneuralyzer. Perfect. It's an old friend. Jay, ain't seen you in a while. Did you peep that drop-top thing out front? My business is banging, dog. You gotta check out the website. It's Jeebsie dot... Okay, whoa. He's retired, right? We need the deneuralyzer. You're kidding. The meter's running, Jeebs. Do you remember me? Can't say I do. I'm good with faces. Heh. I think I'd remember that. The great Kay's a neutral. You're between me and my memories. Do you have this deneuralyzer or not? No. Fresh out. Can't help you. Heh. Don't got it. Even if I did, if it doesn't work, he dies, you blow my head off. If it does, I've brought back Kay, who, for fun, blows my head oh'. So, what's my incentive? Okay, homey, I keep it downstairs next to the snow blowers. Alien prisoners released, armed and ready for your orders. Prisoners of MiB, the scum of the universe. Now it's the scum's turn. I'm in a jam, so I'll make this simple. I need the Light of Zartha, and Kay knows where it is. Whoever brings Kay to me gets Earth. Find a deneuralyzer. They want his memory back. Check. Now. Jarra, good to see you. Okay, that should do it. If I could have your attention while we go over the safety procedures. Keep your hands inside the vehicle. If, during the ride, you become disoriented, there's nothing we can do about it. Have you removed all your jewelry? Are you allergic to shellfish? Jeebs! Right, then! Smoke 'em if you got 'em. Have you used this before? I used it to make some hot-air popcorn. That's about it. Okay! Let's make it happen, cap'n! Hm. Perfect. You're back. No. How'd you know his head grows back? It grows back? Real nice. Okay, that's the last time I help out a friend. Kay, you remember anything? Goodbye. Kay, Wait! Kay! I never got the updated software. Still working off the 6.0. Your brain needs to reboot. Give it a minute. Kay! Bottom of my heart, I'm really sorry. I hope it won't affect our friendship. All those years of loyalty and trust, respect for one another. Right over there! - Where's Kay? - He's not here! He went... Kay's retired. I'm his trigger-happy replacement. Right in the pie hole. Now nothing's gonna taste right. Lower your weapon. No. Jay, how are you, boo-boo? These guys really need Kay. He's a neutral. Tell me something we don't know. Yeah, tell me something... Achoo! I am so sorry. God bless you. Thank you. If I don't bring Kay back to MiB, Serleena's gonna kick my ass. Now, where is he? Where is who? You don't look too good. Yeah, and you look like crap. I take that back. He look like crap. Bend him! Bend him. Wait, don't bend him. Hey, honey, how you doing? Damn decent of you. Don't mention it. I'm gonna be sick. You don't wanna do that. Fellas, I think he's telling the truth. Then he's no good to us. Didn't I teach you anything, kid? Pineal eye! Go for the mosh tendrils! Kay, he's a ball-chinnian. Oh. You were in a tight spot. I handled it. You need a partner. I had one. Job got too tough. I'm back. You got some dust on your coat. So you got your memory back. Yeah. What the hell is going on? Don't know. The Light of Zartha? Never heard of it. Cool. You don't remember the Light of Zartha? Must've neuralyzed myself to keep it from myself. Good plan. What you doing? I do the driving. Wait, no. Whoa, whoa. I remember that. What you remember is you used to drive that old, busted jawn. I drive the new hotness. Old and busted, new hotness. Old busted hotness. - Serleena, please. - Been a long time, Zed. I'm just touched you remembered me. Makes me fuzzy all over. Never forget a pretty whatever you are. Unh! Zed? Zed? Look at you. Twenty-five years, and you're still such a looker. Cut out the meat and dairy. And you, still a pile of squirmy crap in a different wrapper. So feisty. Look, we both need the same thing. Bring him in. Don't think so. What about the Light's secret? If it's not off Earth by midnight, it self-destructs, annihilating your little planet. I lose, you lose. I win, everything keeps spinning. You don't want the Light on Earth any more than I do. All right, Serleena. You win. Zed? Is that you? I could be Agent Em. Zed. Hello? So feisty. Fastest way back to MiB, you take this right on 39th. Right here. Right. Next right on 37th. Right here. Thirty... Thirty... Right! We're not going back to MiB. Headquarters has been breached. We need to peel caps and split wigs. Not ready. Look, you've been out for five years. That's a long time. I understand you're scared. I'm a little scared too. I'm not scared. Me neither. I just thought we was bonding. You're acting like a rookie . Splitting wigs and stepping on caps. No wonder Zed brought me back. He did it because you messed up. Your attitude makes for a stressful environment. Tell it to the hand. Stressful is what we got back at MiB. Exactly. Serleena broke into MiB in order to lure me back. Into a trap. Which is why we can't bust in there. We need a plan. Where we going? Scene of the crime? You're the boss. Scene of the crime. That's a left. I'll contact the witness. We'll talk to her. Things have changed. We used to neuralyze witnesses. See, originally, I'd, um... No, I was going to, uh... I interrogated her. - Then neuralyzed her? - What? MiB code 773/I-1 clearly states that all civilian personnel... Drop that weapon! No, no, no! Jay, I'm... I'm sorry. No, no, I'm fine. It's my fault. Uh... Uh... Kay, my partner. Laura, the witness. Pleasure. Thanks for sending those agents over to keep an eye on me last night. MiB procedural code 594-B states that MiB personnel shall never be used... Ben, the Zarthan, was vaporized here. I assume the perp was over here. Ben. Was he 5'7"", thinning hair? You knew him? Nope. Never seen him before in my life. That is a hell of a fish. Wait a minute. You left yourself clues? In case I was deneuralyzed because my replacement couldn't handle it. If the joker that had got deneuralyzed hadn't created the situation... Boys. All right. You pointing at something. Okay. Excuse me. The astronaut. Jay? Okay, all right. He's pointing... He's like... He like... Who would stack boxes like this? A box stacker who's not stacking boxes. He's leaving clues. It's an arrow. Jay? You're slowing me down, slick. Whatever we're looking for is in these cabinets, right here. Anchovy filets in virgin olive oil. I hope I'm not slowing you down. Good work, partner. Yeah. We gotta figure out where it goes. I know where. Whoa. No. Not yet. MiB code 773 clearly says... I know the code, but she might be important to me. To us. Well, for help. To help us later. Well, she can't stay here. They'll be back. You can stay with friends of mine. People like you? Kind of. Jay! Low bridge! What's going on, man? Hey, what's happening, fellas? MiB is code 101. Bad. Very bad. - I need your help. This is Laura. - Laura! Easy, easy! They're worms. Once you go worm, that's what you'll yearn. Yaah. I've dated worse. They're suspended for stealing from duty-free shop. We were framed. Zed's wormophobic. - Kay! - You're back! They said you were dead. We're double-parked. Laura's very important to me. To us. To the stuff... Me and you, man, the stuff we're doing. Keep an eye on her. I'll keep both on her. No problem! Hey, hey, hey. Why don't you sit here? Like you got a shot. Hey, shut up! My communicator, in case you need it. Ooh. Ha-ha. Nice move. Okay. Um... Oh. Uh... Just watch out for Neeble. Which one's Neeble? Um, he's... Which one of y'all is Neeble? Yo, mama! Ah. Him, right there. It's fine. Everything's straight. It's safe. Don't fall asleep. Twister! Run over your plan one more time. I'm struggling with it. You neuralyzed memory of the Light but left yourself clues. Right. Photo pointing to a key in a pizzeria which opens a locker at Grand Central. In the locker, we'll find another clue. That's the plan. Ah. I like to keep my enemies confused. We all confused, Kay. Are you gonna slow me down? Your brain's working on old software. Why don't you go grab us some coffee? Sure. How do you take it? Black? Couple cubes of kiss my ass? I don't know what's in there, so step back. Kay, for real, man. Open the damn locker. Kay! He's back! The light giver! All hail Kay! All hail Kay! You are the man who would be king of the train locker. Praise Kay! Oh, good and gentle townfolk of Locker C-18, did I leave anything here? Yes. The timekeeper. Left to illuminate our streets and hearts. - I've been looking everywhere for this. - Merciful one! The clock tower! I got y'all, it's cool. Check this out. Titanium case. Waterproof to over 300 meters. That's banging. Who are you, stranger? - Jay. - Hmm. All hail Jay! All hail Jay! Oh, merciful Jay, the keeper of... Come on. - Wait! The commandments! - The tablet! The tablet! The tablet! The tablet! The tablet! We have lived by its word, and peace has reigned throughout our world. Pass it on to others! So that they too may be enlightened! Be kind! Rewind! Reconcile your past, in order to move tranquilly into your future! Two for one every Wednesday. Give twice as much as ye receive on our most sacred of days. Every Wednesday. Large adult entertainment section in the back. That's just nasty. What's with the video card? Don't know. The watch? A reminder. Of what? Can't remember. Guess. I guess we have till midnight, that's 59 minutes to figure it out. Look. Here's an idea. Let's stop chasing butt-backwards clues, get a couple fission carbonizers and get our headquarters back. It's all about to make sense, kid. Is this card valid? - This card hasn't been used in years. - I've been away on business. - Billions of frequent flier miles. - Try and use them. I wanted to go to Cambodia. You can get a lobster dinner for a dollar. The airlines black out holidays. It's a conspiracy, I'm sure, I mean... Can you tell us anything about the account? You never checked out a tape. You reserved one once, but you never picked it up. Newton. There's a rat in the toilet. It's all stopped up. You're gonna have to pee in the sin... Still think I'm paranoid? Yeah. Gentlemen, my name is Newton. I run the place. Seen any aliens lately? You need professional help. He's getting it. It's not working. Okay, so, new case, huh? Episode 27, Light of Zartha. Got it. Jarra, it's a sin they've kept a genius like you locked away. Their agent Jay caught me siphoning ozone to sell on the black market. They're touchy about global warming. I need a spacecraft that can travel 300 times the speed of light. I'll give you whatever you want. Give me Jay. We'll call it even. Groovy. You've got till midnight. Gatbot, I got a little something special for you. Newton? Newton, is that you? Yes, Mom, I'm up here with some friends. I wanna have your baby. Would you like some mini-pizza? You guys want some mini-pizzas? They're good. They're like mini-bagels, with pizza stuff on them. She'll put a little fontina cheese on. She has palsy, so she ends up putting a lot of cheese on. No, thanks, we're cool. All right. Over here. - This is it. - Hm. Finally some hard evidence. Gentlemen, before I play the tape, one question: What's up with anal probing? Aliens travel billions of light years just to check out our... Boy, move. Okay. Just a question. Here is one of their stories that ""never happened"" from one of their files that doesn't exist. 1978. Devastating war of Zartha had raged on for 50 years. Hm, looks like Spielberg's work. But the Zarthans had a great treasure, the Light of Zartha. A source of power so awesome, it alone could mean victory and restoration for the Zarthans or complete annihilation, if it fell into the hands of the Kylothians. A group of Zarthans made the journey, led by the Keeper of the Light... Lauranna. Princess Lauranna. Lauranna beseeched the Men in Black to help her hide the Light on Earth. But they could not intervene. No. It was night. And it was raining. You've been very wise. Kay, please. If Serleena takes the Light, it's the end of our world. If we extend protection for the Light beyond Earth, we put Earth in jeopardy. We must remain neutral. - Where is it? - We're neutral, remember? If you want it, go get it. No! And so never knowing it happened, the people of Earth were once again saved by a secret society of protectors... I shouldn't have. You never sent it off the planet. You hid it here. The worm guys. Are you one of Newton's friends from therapy? Yes, ma'am, I am. Look here, please. Would you like some mini-pizz...? A neuralyz... Okay, first, get some contact lenses. Joints look like they pick up cable. Second, take her to Cambodia. Get her lobster. Pay more than a dollar. Third, the second y'all get back from Cambodia, move your bum ass out of your mom's house. - Let's go. - Boy, you like 40 years old. Agent Jay? All right, all right. Oh. And there ain't no such thing as aliens or Men in Black. You wanna go to Cambodia? Yeah. Hey, Mom? Communicator, Jay. Laura, it's me. Jay, we're playing Twister. What's up, Jay? Quit touching my butt! I thought it was your face. They're good at this. They don't have spines. Oh. They were telling me about Oprah, from Chicago. Maybe landed in Chicago. Ha-ha-ha. - Are you wearing a bracelet? - Yeah. Is it glowing? It's never done that before. We're on our way. Communicator, Frank. Frank, get down to Level C. Deactivate lockdown. We're headed to the worm guys. We found the Light. Got it, Jay. Scrad? Bitch. Why didn't you say I love you? He's a dog. I don't even like him. No, the girl. You're sweet on her. That's why you didn't neuralyze her. You got emotionally involved. Like you did with Lauranna? I put the entire planet in danger. I don't want to see you making my mistakes. Whatever, man. Laura? Oi. Damn! Never stood half a chance. Oh, boy. Unh. That's gonna leave a scar. Where's Laura? MiB headquarters. Some dumb two-headed guy. They got the bracelet. We got 39 minutes. You guys, um, pull yourselves together. Damn. Oh, that's feeling better. - Hey, guys, wait up! - Let me grab my drink! Serleena has the bracelet. Why take Laura? She also wants me. What's the book say? We're off book. I say split some wigs. We need wig-splitting weapons. Got them. Ah. Paw Paw's coming to visit me. Hello, Paw Paw. Paw Paw and ZuZu love to see what's going on in the garden. Don't worry, folks. I used to live here. Came to pick up a few things. Nice place. Hoo-ah. Hoo-eeh. Yah! See you. You did not see a room full of weapons or four aliens. You will cherish and love each other for the rest of your lives. Which could be the next 28 minutes, so get to loving and cherishing. Oh. And she can stay up as late as she want and have cookies and candy and stuff. Four minutes to launch. Four minutes to launch. Your ship is ready. Good. Send it to Kyloth now. Ready, guys? Lock and load, baby. You ready, kid? Kid? I saved the world from a Kreelon invasion. They're the Backstreet Boys of the universe. They throw snowballs? Know what you're doing? I'm about to attack one of the most feared aliens with four worms and a mailman. Let's make it hot. No, no, wait! A code 101 lockdown! The building gets pressurized. Nothing in, nothing out. I knew that. Yeah, you knew. Front and center, worms! You got it. It's about time you guys got here. That lady is causing all kinds of hell. Yummy. Someone I need to eat. Get to the launch pad. The bracelet shows the departure point. Do not come back for me. What do you mean? Do not come back for me. Worm guys, give me some cover fire. Too scared, can't move. Go! Limber. Go to subcontrol panel 7-R-Delta. Shut off power so they can't take off. Can't. Too scared. Oh, that way. Away from the bullets. No problem. Hoo-ah. Alley-oop. Nice to see you again, Kay. 3 minutes to launch. Jay! Three minutes to launch. Hello, Jay. Long time. Jarra! What's up, man? You look great. What's it been? Five years? And 42 days. You count every one when you're locked away. You shouldn't have tried to steal our ozone. Be there in one minute. Over our dead titanium bodies! Two minutes. Uh, let's play this one by ear. I should have vaporized you before. You really did love Lauranna. Didn't you, Kay? You silly little man. Unh! Aah! Ha-ha. Ow! Aah! Two minutes to launch. Just go, I'll be fine! What you talking about? I'm winning. Jarra, you are under arrest for being that ugly, and for making that many copies. Surrender! I want him in pieces. Aah! Whoo! Jarra Jr. is going, going, gone! - Rectum. - Damn near killed him! Never get tired of that one. Where do we shut off the power? I don't know. - I'm fine. I'll be there in a minute. - No, he won't. Uh-huh. Down to one now, Jarra! Thirty seconds to launch. Fifteen seconds to launch. Ten seconds to launch. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. Launch terminated. What did you mean, leave you? Well, he took your gun. Cracked your head. Slammed you across the room. Half the time you were on your back. Look, that's how I fight. You've lost, you insignificant speck. You've wasted 25 years of my time, and for what? The total annihilation of Zartha. All because you went mushy. I'll give you one last chance to surrender, you slimy invertebrate. What are you gonna do to stop me? Not me. Him. Your flight's been canceled. Shut down power. Shut down power. Buttons, buttons. I'm guessing, uh... Yeah. - Worms! - Sorry. Give me the bracelet. I'm going with you. Everybody in the car. Everybody. This bracelet is what everybody's been after? It's often something small. It's not the Light. It tells us the departure point. What? If we don't get there in 11 minutes, that bracelet will go nuclear and destroy Earth. What?! Hello. Oh. Wait, Kay, no. I know what I'm doing. Damn. Modified to hyper-speed! Seat belts. What's that? At hyper-speed, you have to use the navigational stalk. Toggle switches for the ailerons . Joysticks for the stabilizer and rudder. Okay. I just want you to know... Hold on to that for one second. Computer, worms. I said, ""Bitch, if you don't want me to kick your skinny Zone Diet ass, turn around and exit the planet."" Frank, where are you? Main hall, egg display. We're taking fire. Kay pushed the red button. Computer at MiB can destroy bogey. I'll walk you through it. Jay? Frank. You were the best darn partner a Remoolian could ever have. Godspeed. Frank? Frank? Okay, here we go, automatic pilot. It is not automatic piloting. He doesn't operate at hyper-speed. I could use a steering wheel here! This is what we got. Didn't you ever have a Game Boy? What is a Game Boy? You know what? Move. Move. Okay. Oh! Hey, that is not the navigational stalk! Okay, straight down. Idiots. Subway may not be the best place to lose her. Shh. Where is he? He? Jeff. Hang on! Oops. Teeth. Running out of time, Kay. Where is the Light? Right here. What? What, I'm the Light? No. No way. You have a planet to save. You're mistaken. I work at a pizzeria. Two days ago, I was running a post office. You are who you are. Laura, you are the Light. The leader of your people. Their spirit and their hope. The power is within you to save a planet. I protected you until it was your time. Your time is now. You will save a world. You know things before they happen. I'm a Libra. You're Zarthan. When you get sad, it rains. Lots of people get sad when it rains. It rains because you're sad, baby. It's not fair. Never is. We are who we are, even if we sometimes forget. Jeff, I am so not in the mood for you! Get back in the subway! Now! That's not good. Wait! No! Aah! Jay! I cannot emphasize enough how much we need you on that transport. Laura! You have to go! Oh, jeez. Go. He's fine. He does this all the time. Nope! About to lay the smackdown on your candy ass. Laura! It's your destiny! I was talking, Kay! Aah! Hey! No biting. If you don't go, we all die. You're just as beautiful as your mother. Kay? A little help? Kay? Might I suggest a bigger gun? Kid? Yeah. Thanks for bringing me back. No problem. Why didn't you tell me? Would you have let her go? So, what's it like on the outside? Not doing this every day? It's nice. Sleep late on the weekends. Watch the Weather Channel. I did miss this city. So Laura is Princess Lauranna's daughter. Did y'all...? MiB is a mess. Let's go, kid. Let's go? Thousands of people in New York and New Jersey saw our little event. Plan needs to be thought out. Plan needs to be cool. What you...? Kid, I'll get you trained yet. I want one of those. Damn! Hey Hey. How you doing? I'm good, man. We've all been there. The girl is gone and it hurts. Wanna talk'? No. I can help. No. Still sulking? No. Yeah. Hell, you miss her. It happens to all of us. I knew this hot young thing. When our bodies were in the positions of the Kamasutra... Zed! Ah... Come on, man! Damn! I'll tell you about dames. They say they want to be scratched, but they really want is: Hey! Frank. What? Still sitting shiva? Want my advice? No. No advice. No talking. Hell, no. Fellas, I swear, I'm fine. All hail Jay! All hail Jay! I brought them from Grand Central. Why put them in my locker? I thought it would put things in perspective. It's kind of sad. We need to let them out. They need to know the world is bigger than that. Still a rookie. Whoa., Senator, we're making our final approach into Coruscant. Very good, Lieutenant. We made it. I guess I was wrong. There was no danger at all. Cord. Milady, I'm so sorry. I've failed you, Senator. No. Milady, you're still in danger here. - I shouldn't have come back. - This vote is very important. You did your duty. Cord did hers. Now, come. Senator Amidala, please. I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists. If they do break away-- I will not let this Republic that has stood for a thousand years... be split in two. My negotiations will not fail. If they do, you must realize... there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We're keepers of the peace, not soldiers. Master Yoda... do you think it will really come to war? The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see the future is. The Loyalist Committee has arrived, Your Honour. Good. Send them in. We will discuss this matter later. Senator Amidala, your tragedy on the landing platform-- terrible. Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart. Do you have any idea who was behind this attack? Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of Naboo. I think that Count Dooku was behind it. He is a political idealist, not a murderer. You know, milady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He couldn't assassinate anyone. It's not in his character. But for certain, Senator... in grave danger you are. Master Jedi, may I suggest... the senator be placed under the protection of your graces? Do you really think that's a wise decision under these stressful times? Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe-- The situation is that serious? No, but I do, Senator. I realize all too well that additional security... might be disruptive for you... but perhaps someone you're familiar with. An old friend, like Master Kenobi. That's possible. He's just returned from a border dispute on Ansion. Do it for me, milady. Please? The thought of losing you... is unbearable. I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, milady. Thank you, Master Windu. - You seem a little on edge. - Not at all. I haven't felt you this tense since we fell into that nest of gundarks. You fell into that nightmare, Master... and I rescued you, remember? Oh... yes. You're sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath. I haven't seen her in ten years, Master. Obi? Obi! - Mesa so smilen to seein yousa! - Good to see you again,Jar Jar. Senator Padm. Mesa palos here! Lookie, lookie, Senator. Desa Jedi arriven. It's a great pleasure to see you again, milady. It has been far too long, Master Kenobi. Ani? - My goodness, you've grown. - So have you. Grown more beautiful, I mean. Well, for a senator, I mean. Ani, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine. Our presence here will be invisible, milady, I can assure you. I'm Captain Typho of Her Majesty's security service. Queen Jamillia has been informed of your assignment. I am grateful you are here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit. I don't need more security. I need answers. I want to know who's trying to kill me. We are here to protect you, Senator, not to start an investigation. We will find out who's trying to kill you, Padm. I promise you. We will not exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner. I meant that in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course. We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin... and you will pay attention to my lead. - Why? - What? Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate. We will do exactly as the council has instructed. And you will learn your place, young one. Perhaps with merely your presence... the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now, if you'll excuse me... I will retire. I know I'll feel better having you here. I'll have an officer stationed on every floor... and I'll be in the control centre downstairs. Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Ani. She hardly even recognized me,Jar Jar. I've thought about her every day since we parted and... she's forgotten me completely. Shesa happy. Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time. You're focusing on the negative, Anakin. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was pleased to see us. Now, let's check the security. I hit the ship, but they used a decoy. We'll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam. My client is getting impatient. Take these. Be careful. They're very poisonous. And, Zam, there can be no mistakes this time. Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin would try that way. - Any activity up here? - Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her. - What's going on? - She covered the cameras. I don't think she liked me watching her. What is she thinking? She programmed R2 to warn us if there is an intruder. There are many other ways to kill a senator. I know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don't we, Master? You're using her as bait. It was her idea. Don't worry. No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me. It's too risky. Besides, your senses aren't that attuned, my young apprentice. And yours are? Possibly. You look tired. I don't sleep well any more. Because of your mother? I don't know why I keep dreaming about her. Dreams pass in time. I'd much rather dream about Padm. Just being around her again is... intoxicating. Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin. They betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi order... a commitment not easily broken. And don't forget, she's a politician. They're not to be trusted. She's not like the others in the senate, Master. It is my experience that senators focus... only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they're in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy... - in order to get those funds. - Not another lecture. At least not on the economics of politics. And besides, you're generalizing. The chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt. Palpatine is a politician. I have observed that he is very clever... in following the passions and the prejudices of the senators. I think he's a good man-- I sense it too. Stay here! Are you all right, milady? What the-- Jedi poo doo! - What took you so long? - Oh, you know, Master. - I couldn't find a speeder I liked... - There he is. with the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities. If you spent as long practising your sabre techniques as you do your wit... you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman. I thought I already did. Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Pull up, Anakin. Pull up! You know I don't like it when you do that. Sorry, Master. I forgot you don't like flying. I don't mind flying, but what you're doing is suicide! Anakin! How many times have I told you... stay away from power couplings! That was good! Where are you going? He went that way. Master, if we keep this chase going any longer... that creep is gonna end up deep-fried... and, personally, I'd like to find out who he is and who he's working for. This is a short cut... I think. Well, you've lost him. I'm deeply sorry, Master. That was some short cut, Anakin. He went completely the other way. - Once again you've proved-- - If you'll excuse me. I hate it when he does that. Anakin! - She went into the club, Master. - Patience. - Use the Force. Think. - Sorry, Master. - He went in there to hide, not to run. - Yes, Master. - Next time, try not to lose it. - Yes, Master. - This weapon is your life. - I try, Master. Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me? Don't say that, Master. You're the closest thing I have to a father. Then why don't you listen to me? I am trying. Can you see him? I think he is a she... and I think she is a changeling. In that case, be extra careful. - Go and find her. - Where are you going, Master? For a drink. Thank you. -You wanna buy some death sticks? -You don't want to sell me death sticks. I don't want to sell you death sticks. You want to go home and rethink your life. I want to go home and rethink my life. Easy. Jedi business. Go back to your drinks. Do you know who it was you were trying to kill? It was a senator from Naboo. - And who hired you? - It was just a job. Who hired you? Tell us. Tell us now! It was a bounty hunter called-- Wee shahnit... sleemo. Toxic dart. Track down this bounty hunter you must, Obi-Wan. Most importantly, find out who he's working for. What about Senator Amidala? She will still need protecting. Handle that your Padawan will. Anakin, escort the senator back to her home planet of Naboo. She'll be safer there. And don't use registered transport. Travel as refugees. As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult... to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital. Until caught this killer is... our judgement she must respect. Anakin, go to the senate... and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter. I will talk with her. Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order. I know her well enough to assure you of that. Thank you, Your Excellency. And so, they've finally given you an assignment. Your patience has paid off. Your guidance more than my patience. You don't need guidance, Anakin. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then you will be invincible. I have said it many times: You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met. Thank you, Your Excellency. I see you becoming the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin... even more powerful than Master Yoda. I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet. The council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. The boy has exceptional skills. But he still has much to learn, Master. His abilities have made him, well, arrogant. Yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi. Too sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones. Remember, Obi-Wan, if the prophecy is true... your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance. I'm taking an extended leave of absence. It will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate. Representative Binks, I know I can count on you. Mesa honoured to be taking on dissa heavy burden. Mesa accept this with muy, muy humility and-- Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up. I'm sure you have a great deal to do. Of course. Milady. I do not like this idea of hiding. Don't worry. Now that the council has ordered an investigation... it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find this bounty hunter. I haven't worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act... to not be here when its fate is decided. Sometimes we must let go of our pride... and do what is requested of us. Anakin, you've grown up. Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it. Don't get me wrong. Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and... as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. In some ways-- a lot of ways-- I'm really ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials... but he feels that I'm too unpredictable. He won't let me move on. - That must be frustrating. - It's worse. He's overly critical. He never listens. He doesn't understand. It's not fair! All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow. I know. Anakin... don't try to grow up too fast. But I am grown up. You said it yourself. Please don't look at me like that. Why not? It makes me feel uncomfortable. Sorry, milady. - Be safe, milady. - Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorm. The threat's on you two now. He'll be safe with me. You'll be fine. It's not me, milady. I worry about you. What if they realize you've left the capital? Well, then my Jedi protector will have to prove how good he is. Anakin... don't do anything without first consulting either myself or the council. Yes, Master. I'll get to the bottom of this plot quickly, milady. You'll be back here in no time. I'll be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi. - It's time to go. - I know. Anakin, may the Force be with you. May the Force be with you, Master. Suddenly I'm afraid. This is my first assignment on my own. I am too. Don't worry. We have R2 with us. I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish. I'd be more concerned about her doing something than him. Someone to see ya, honey! Jedi, by the looks of him. Obi-Wan! Hello, Dex. Take a seat. I'll be right with ya. - You wanna cup o' jawa juice? - Oh, yes. Thank you. Old buddy! So, my friend, what can I do for ya? You can tell me what this is. Well, whattaya know! I ain't seen one of these since I was prospectin'... on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim. Can you tell me where it came from? This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino sabredart. I wonder why it didn't show up in the analysis archives. It's these funny little cuts on the side that give it away. Those analysis droids only focus on symbols. I should think that you Jedi would have more respect... for the difference between knowledge and... wisdom. Well, if droids could think... there'd be none of us here, would there? Kamino. I'm not familiar with it. Is it in the Republic? No, no. It's beyond the outer rim. I'd say about 1 2 parsecs outside the Rishi Maze. Should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archives. These Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damn good ones too. - Cloners. Are they friendly? - Depends. Depends on what, Dex? On how good your manners are... and how big your... pocketbook is. - Did you call for assistance? - Yes, I did. Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi? Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system called Kamino. It doesn't show up on the archive charts. Kamino. It's not a system I'm familiar with. Are you sure you have the right coordinates? According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here... just south of the Rishi Maze. I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for... doesn't exist. Impossible. Perhaps the archives are incomplete. If an item does not appear in our records... it does not exist. Hey, you! No droids! Get outta here! Thank you, R2. Must be difficult, having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like. Or be with the people that I love. Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi. Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love... is central to a Jedi's life. So you might say that we are encouraged to love. You've changed so much. You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. Reach out. Sense the Force around you. Use your feelings you must. Younglings. Younglings! A visitor we have. Hello, Master Obi-Wan. Hello. I'm sorry to disturb you, Master. What help can I be, Obi-Wan? I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him, but the systems don't show on the archive maps. Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing! Liam, the shades. Gather round the map reader. Clear your minds... and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will. It ought to be here... but it isn't. Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot. Gravity's silhouette remains... but the star and all the planets... disappeared they have. How can this be? A thought? Anyone. Master? Because someone erased it from the archive memory. Truly wonderful the mind of a child is. The Padawan is right. Go to the centre of gravity's pull... and find your planet you will. The data must have been erased. But who could empty information from the archives? Isn't that impossible? Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who and why, harder to answer. Meditate on this I will. I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected... but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready. The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they even tried to amend the constitution... so you could stay in office. I was relieved when my two terms were up. But when the queen asked me to serve as senator... I couldn't refuse her. I agree with her. I think the Republic needs you. I'm glad that you chose to serve. If the senate votes to create an army, it's sure to push us into a civil war. It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic. Do you see any way through negotiations... to bring the separatists back into the Republic? Not if they feel threatened. They'll turn to the Trade Federations or the Commerce Guilds for help. It's outrageous... but after four trials in the Supreme Court... Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation. I fear the senate is powerless to resolve this crisis. We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it. Let's pray that day never comes. In the meantime, we must consider your own safety. What is your suggestion, Master Jedi? Anakin's not a Jedi yet. He's still a Padawan learner. - But I was thinking-- - Hold on a minute. Excuse me. I was thinking I would stay in the lake country. There are some places up there that are very isolated. Excuse me. I'm in charge of security here, milady. And this is my home. I know it very well. That is why we're here. I think it would be wise... if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance. Sorry, milady. Perfect. It's settled, then. There it is, R4, right where it should be. Our missing planet Kamino. Master Jedi. The prime minister is expecting you. - I'm expected? - Of course. He is anxious to meet you. After all these years... we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now, please, this way. May I present Lama Su... prime minister of Kamino. And this is Master Jedi-- Obi-Wan Kenobi. I trust you're going to enjoy your stay. Please. And now to business. You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule. 200,000 units are ready... with a million more well on the way. That's good news. Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas... that his order will be met on time. I'm sorry. Master-- Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still... a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not? Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago. I'm so sorry to hear that. But I'm sure he would have been proud of the army we've built for him. The army? Yes, a clone army, and I must say... one of the finest we've ever created. Tell me, Prime Minister... when my master first contacted you about the army... did he say who it was for? Of course he did. This army is for the Republic. But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself. That's why I'm here. We used to come here for school retreat. We would swim to that island every day. I love the water. We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing. I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating... and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here, everything is soft... and smooth. No. I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry. Very impressive. I'd hoped you would be pleased. Clones can think creatively. You will find that they are immensely superior to droids. We take great pride in our combat education and training programmes. This group was created about five years ago. You mentioned growth acceleration. Oh, yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now we can do it in half the time. I see. They are totally obedient... taking any order without question. We modified their genetic structure... to make them less independent than the original host. And who was the original host? A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. And where is this bounty hunter now? Oh, we keep him here. Apart from his pay, which is considerable... Fett demanded only one thing: an unaltered clone for himself. - Curious, isn't it? -""Unaltered''? Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration. I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett. I would be very happy to arrange it for you. Magnificent, aren't they? I don't know. Sure you do. You just don't want to tell me. You gonna use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me? They only work on the weak-minded. All right. I was 1 2. His name was Palo. We were both in the Legislative Youth Programme. He was a few years older than I. Very cute. Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes. All right, I get the picture. Whatever happened to him? I went into public service. He went on to become an artist. Maybe he was the smart one. You really don't like politicians, do you? I like two or three... but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works. How would you have it work? We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem... agree what's in the best interest of all the people... and then do it. That's exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't always agree. Well, then they should be made to. - By whom? Who's gonna make them? - I don't know. Someone. - You? - Of course not me. - But someone. - Someone wise. Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me. Well, if it works. - You're making fun of me. - No. I'd be much too frightened to tease a senator. Ani, are you all right? Boba, is your father here? Yep. May we see him? Sure. Dad, Taun We's here. Jango, welcome back. Was your trip productive? Fairly. This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's come to check on our progress. Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud. I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe. Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant? - Once or twice. - Recently? Possibly. Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas. Boba, rood eht so-heeck. Master who? Sifo-Dyas. Is he not the Jedi who hired you for this job? Never heard of him. Really? I was recruited by a man called Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden. Curious. Do you like your army? I look forward to seeing them in action. They'll do their job well. I'll guarantee that. Thank you for your time,Jango. Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi. What is it, Dad? Pack your things. We're leaving. And when I got to them, we went into aggressive negotiations. "" Aggressive negotiations''? What's that? Well, negotiations with a lightsabre. If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this, he'd be very grumpy. From the moment I met you... all those years ago... not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again... I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you-- I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss... that you should never have given me. My heart is beating... hoping that that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul... tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything that you ask. If you are suffering as much as I am, please, tell me. I can't. We can't. It's... just not possible. Anything is possible, Padm. Listen to me. No, you listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi. I'm a senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion... it'll take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other. Then you do feel something. I will not let you give up your future for me. You are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings... but I can't. I will not give in to this. Well, you know... it wouldn't have to be that way. We could keep it a secret. We'd be living a lie... one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that? No. You're right. It would destroy us. Tell your council that the first battalions are ready. And remind them, if they need more troops... it will take more time to grow them. I won't forget, and thank you. Thank you. R4! Scramble code five to Coruscant, care of the old folks' home! I have successfully made contact with the prime minister of Kamino. They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army. I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter... is the assassin we are looking for. Do you think these cloners are involved... in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala? No, Master. There appears to be no motive. Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan. Clear your mind must be... if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot. Yes, Master. They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for a clone army... at the request of the senate almost ten years ago. I was under the impression he was killed before that. Did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army? No. Whoever placed that order... did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council. Bring him here. Question him we will. Yes, Master. I will report back when I have him. Blind we are if creation of this clone army... we could not see. I think it is time we informed the senate... that our ability to use the Force has diminished. Only the dark lord of the Sith knows of our weakness. If informed the senate is... multiply our adversaries will. No. Mom, no. Don't go. I don't want to disturb you. Your presence is soothing. You had another nightmare last night. Jedi don't have nightmares. I heard you. I saw my mother. She is suffering, Padm. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She is in pain. I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator... but I have to go. I have to help her. I'll go with you. I'm sorry. I don't have a choice. Dad, look! Boba, get on board! Oh, not good. Wait right there. Okey-okey. Chut-chut, Watto. Let me help you with that. What? What do you want? Wait! You're a Jedi! Whatever it is, I didn't do it. I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker. Ani? Little Ani? Nahhh. You are Ani! It is you! You sure sprouted, huh? AJedi! Whattaya know! Maybe you could help with some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money. My mother. Oh, yeah. Shmi. She's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her. - You sold her? - Years ago. Sorry, Ani, but you know, business is business. I sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. At least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her! Can ya beat that, eh? Do you know where they are now? Long way from here. Someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think. I'd like to know. Sure. Absolutely! Let's go look at my records, huh? Dad! I think we're being tracked! He must have put a homing device on our hull. Hang on, son. We'll move into the asteroid field... and we'll have a couple of surprises for him. Seismic charges! Stand by. He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy. Watch out! Get him, Dad! Fire! Blast! This is why I hate flying! We got him! We'll just have to finish him. R4, prepare to jettison the spare part canisters. Fire them now! We won't be seeing him again. Well, R4, I think we've waited long enough. There's an unusual concentration of Federation ships over there, R4. Stay with the ship, R2. Hello. How might I be of service? I am C-- 3PO? The maker! Master Ani! I knew you would return. I knew it! And Miss Padm. Oh, my. Hello, 3PO. Bless my circuits! I'm so pleased to see you both. I've come to see my mother. I think perhaps we'd better go indoors. Master Owen, might I present two most important visitors. I'm Anakin Skywalker. Owen Lars. - This is my girlfriend, Beru. - Hello. I'm Padm. I guess I'm your stepbrother. I had a feeling you might show up someday. Is my mother here? No, she's not. Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife. We should go inside. We have a lot to talk about. It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusken Raiders. Your mother had gone out early, like she always did... to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators. From the tracks, she was about halfway home... when they took her. Those Tuskens walk like men... but they're vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. I'd be out there with them, but after I lost my leg... I just couldn't ride any more until I heal. I don't want to give up on her... but she's been gone a month. There's little hope she's lasted this long. Where are you going? To find my mother. Your mother's dead, son. Accept it. You're gonna have to stay here. These are good people, Padm. You'll be safe. I won't be long. We must persuade the Commerce Guild... and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty. What about the senator from Naboo? Is she dead yet? I am not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk. I am a man of my word, Viceroy. With these new battle droids we've built for you... you'll have the finest army in the galaxy. As I explained to you earlier... I am quite convinced that 1 0,000 more systems... will rally to our cause with your support, gentlemen. What you are proposing could be construed as treason. The Techno Union army... is at your disposal, Count. The Banking Clan will sign your treaty. Good. Very good. Our friends from the Trade Federation have pledged their support... and when their battle droids are combined with yours... we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy. The Jedi will be overwhelmed. The Republic will agree to any demands we make. Mom? Ani? Ani? Is it you? I'm here, Mom. You're safe. You look so handsome. My son. My grown-up son. I'm so proud of you, Ani. I missed you. Now I am complete. I love y-- Stay with me, Mom. Everything-- I love-- I love-- Anakin! No! What is it? Pain, suffering... death I feel. Something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain... terrible pain. The transmitter is working, but we're not receiving a return signal. Coruscant's too far. R4, can you boost the power? We'll have to try something else. Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo. It's much closer. Anakin, do you copy? This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin? He's not on Naboo, R4. I'm going to try and widen the range. I do hope nothing's happened to him. That's Anakin's tracking signal, all right... but it's coming from Tatooine. What in the blazes is he doing there? I told him to stay on Naboo. We haven't got much time. Anakin, do you copy? This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Retransmit this message-- Anakin, do you copy? My long-range transmitter has been knocked out. Retransmit this message to Coruscant. I brought you something. Are you hungry? The shifter broke. Life seems so much simpler when you're fixing things. I'm good at fixing things. Always was. But I couldn't-- Why'd she have to die? Why couldn't I save her? I know I could have! Sometimes there are things no one can fix. - You're not all-powerful, Ani. - Well, I should be! Someday I will be. I will be the most powerful Jedi ever. I promise you. I will even learn to stop people from dying. It's all Obi-Wan's fault! He's jealous! He's holding me back! What's wrong, Ani? I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead. Every single one of them. And not just the men... but the women... and the children too. They're like animals... and I slaughtered them like animals! I hate them! To be angry is to be human. I'm a Jedi. I know I'm better than this. I know wherever you are it's become a better place. You were the most loving partner a man could ever have. Goodbye, my darling wife. And thank you. I wasn't strong enough to save you, Mom. I wasn't strong enough. But I promise I won't fail again. I miss you... so much. R2? What are you doing here? It seems that he is carrying a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Master Ani, does that name mean anything to you? Anakin, my long-range transmitter has been knocked out. Retransmit this message to Coruscant. I have tracked the bounty hunter, Jango Fett... to the droid foundries on Geonosis. The Trade Federation is to take delivery of a droid army here... and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray... is behind the assassination attempts on Senator Amidala. The Commerce Guilds and the Corporate Alliance... have both pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming-- Wait. More happening on Geonosis, I feel, than has been revealed. I agree. We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you is to stay where you are. Protect the senator at all costs. That is your first priority. Understood, Master. They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come halfway across the galaxy. Look. Geonosis is less than a parsec away. If he's still alive. Are you just gonna sit here and let him die? - He's your friend, your mentor. - He's like my father! But you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here. He gave you strict orders to protect me... and I'm going to help Obi-Wan. If you plan to protect me, you'll just have to come along. I'm not worried, R2. It's just I've never flown before. The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war. There can be no doubt of that. Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them. The debate is over. Now we need that clone army. Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The senate will never approve the use of clones... before the separatists attack. This is a crisis. The senate must vote the chancellor emergency powers. He can then approve the creation of an army. But what senator would have the courage... to propose such a radical amendment? If only Senator Amidala were here. Traitor. Oh, no, my friend. This is a mistake, a terrible mistake. They have gone too far. This is madness. I thought you were the leader here, Dooku. This had nothing to do with me, I assure you. I will petition immediately to have you set free. Well, I hope it doesn't take too long. I have work to do. May I ask why a Jedi knight... is all the way out here on Geonosis? I've been tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Do you know him? There are no bounty hunters here that I am aware of. The Geonosians don't trust them. Who can blame them? But he is here, I can assure you. It's a great pity our paths have never crossed before, Obi-Wan. Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you. I wish he were still alive. I could use his help right now. Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you. Don't be so sure, my young Jedi. You forget that he was once my apprentice... just as you were once his. He knew all about the corruption in the senate... but he wouldn't have gone along with it if he had learned the truth as I have. - The truth? - The truth. What if I told you that the Republic was now under the control... of the dark lord of the Sith? No, that's not possible. The Jedi would be aware of it. The dark side of the Force has clouded their vision, my friend. Hundreds of senators are now under the influence... of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious. I don't believe you. The viceroy of the Trade Federation... was once in league with this Darth Sidious... but he was betrayed ten years ago by the dark lord. He came to me for help. He told me everything. You must join me, Obi-Wan... and together we will destroy the Sith! I will never join you, Dooku. It may be difficult to secure your release. It's-a clear desa separatists made a pact... wesa desa Federation du Trade. Senators, ""dellow felagates'': In response to this direct threat to the Republic... mesa propose that the senate... give immediately emergency powers... to the supreme chancellor. Palpatine! Palpatine! Order! We shall have order! It is with great reluctance... that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracy. I love the Republic. The power you give me... I will lay down when this crisis has abated. And as my first act with this new authority... I will create a grand army of the Republic... to counter the increasing threats of the separatists. It is done, then. I will take what Jedi we have left and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan. Visit I will the cloners on Kamino... and see this army they have created for the Republic. See those columns of steam straight ahead? They're exhaust vents of some type. That'll do. Look, whatever happens out there, follow my lead. I'm not interested in getting into a war here. As a member of the senate... maybe I can find a diplomatic solution to this mess. Don't worry. I've given up trying to argue with you. My obtuse little friend, if they had needed our help... they would have asked for it. You obviously have a great deal to learn about human behaviour. For a mechanic, you seem to do an excessive amount of thinking. I am programmed to understand humans! ""What does that mean?'' That means I am in charge here! Where are you going now? You don't know what's out there. Have you no sense at all? Idiot! Please wait. Do you know where you're going? Wait. Oh, my goodness! Shut me down! Machines making machines. How perverse! Calm down, R2! I almost fell. You'll get your chance-- I'm scrap. It's a nightmare! I want to go home! What did I do to deserve this? I wonder what happened to poor little R2. He's always getting himself into trouble. Oh, no! Uh-oh. I'm so confused. Not again! Obi-Wan's gonna kill me. Don't move,Jedi! Take him away. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life. What are you talking about? I love you. You love me? I thought we had decided not to fall in love... that we would be forced to live a lie... and that it would destroy our lives. I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. I truly... deeply love you... and before we die, I want you to know. I was beginning to wonder if you'd got my message. I retransmitted it just as you had requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you. Good job. Settle down. Settle down. Let the executions begin. I've got a bad feeling about this. -Just relax. Concentrate. - What about Padm? She seems to be on top of things. She can't do that! Shoot her... or something! Jump! This isn't how it's supposed to be! Jango! Finish her off! Patience, Viceroy, patience. She will die. Master Windu. How pleasant of you to join us. This party's over. Brave... but foolish, my old Jedi friend. You're impossibly outnumbered. I don't think so. We'll see. My legs aren't moving. I must need maintenance. What's all this noise? A battle! There's been some terrible mistake! I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction! Die,Jedi dogs! Oh! What did I say? Oh, dear. I'm terribly sorry about all this. Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up. - You call this a diplomatic solution? - No, I call it aggressive negotiations. - Uh-oh. - Roger, roger. R2, what are you doing here? What are you doing? Stop that! You're going to strain something. My neck! Now where are you taking me? This is such a drag! I'm quite beside myself. R2, please be careful! You're singeing my circuits! Yes, but is my head on straight? Master Windu... you have fought gallantly... worthy of recognition in the archives of the Jedi order. Now... it is finished. Surrender... and your lives will be spared. We will not be hostages to be bartered, Dooku! Then... I'm sorry, old friend. Look! Around the survivors a perimeter create. I've had the most peculiar dream! If Dooku escapes... rally more systems to his cause he will. Hold on! Aim right above the fuel cells! Good call, my young Padawan. The Jedi have amassed a huge army. That doesn't seem possible. How could the Jedi come up with an army so quickly? We must send all available droids into battle. There are too many. Our communications have been jammed. Pilot, land in that assembly area! Yes, sir. Sir... I have five special commando units awaiting your orders, sir. To the forward command centre take me. Attack those Federation starships, quickly! Master Yoda, all forward positions are advancing. Very good. Very good. This is not looking good at all! We must get the starships back into space. We have to order a retreat. My master will never allow the Republic... to get away with this treachery. I'm sending my warriors to hide in the catacombs. The Jedi must not find our designs for the ultimate weapon. If they find out what we are planning to build, we're doomed. I will take the designs with me to Coruscant. They will be much safer there with my master. Concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship. Yes, sir. Move all quadrants to sector 51 5. Look over there! It's Dooku! Shoot him down! We're out of rockets, sir. - Follow him! - We're gonna need some help! There isn't time! Anakin and I can handle this! Put the ship down! Don't let your personal feelings get in the way! Follow that speeder! - Lower the ship! - I can't take Dooku alone! I need you! If we catch him, we can end this war right now! - We have a job to do! - I don't care! Put the ship down! You will be expelled from the Jedi order! - I can't leave her! - Come to your senses! What do you think Padm would do were she in your position? She would do her duty. The droid army is in full retreat. Well done, Commander. Bring me a ship. You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku. We'll take him together. - I'm taking him now! - No, Anakin! No! As you see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now... back down. I don't think so. Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. Surely you can do better. Are you all right? Uh-huh. We'd better get back to the forward command centre. No. Gather what troops you can. We've got to get to that hangar. Get a transport. Hurry! Right away. Brave of you, boy. But I would have thought you had learned your lesson. I am a slow learner. Master Yoda. Count Dooku. You have interfered with our affairs for the last time. Powerful you have become, Dooku. The dark side I sense in you. I've become more powerful than any Jedi. Even you. Much to learn you still have. It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided... by our knowledge of the Force... but by our skills with a lightsabre. Fought well you have, my old Padawan. This is just the beginning. The Force is with us, Master Sidious. Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have done well. I have good news for you, my lord. - The war has begun. - Excellent. Everything is going as planned. Do you believe what Count Dooku said about Sidious controlling the senate? It doesn't feel right. Joined the dark side Dooku has. Lies, deceit... creating mistrust are his ways now. Nevertheless.. I feel we should keep a closer eye on the senate. I agree. Where is your apprentice? On his way to Naboo, escorting Senator Amidala home. I have to admit that without the clones, it would not have been a victory. Victory? Victory, you say? Master Obi-Wan, not victory. The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun the Clone War has., Previously on Hannibal... - How do you know Hannibal is in Florence? - Botticelli. You're drawing them to you, aren't you? I'm not searching for Hannibal. I know exactly where he is. I will pay 3 million dollars for the doctor alive. I'm inspector Rinaldo Pazzi. Dr. Lecter is careful. He will strike. You're going to be caught. It's already been set into motion. Jack. He's wounded... and he's worried. No, Hannibal doesn't worry. Knowing he's in danger won't rattle him any more than killing does. If Rinaldo Pazzi had decided to do his job as an officer of the law, he would have determined very quickly that he was Hannibal Lecter. Would have taken less than 30 minutes - to get a warrant. - All those resources were denied to Pazzi. As soon as he decided to sell Hannibal, he became a bounty hunter. Outside the law and alone. Here we are: outside the law and alone. Have you told la polizia they're looking for Hannibal Lecter? They're motivated to find Dr. Fell inside the law. Knowing who he is, what he's worth, it will just coax them out of bounds. - That'd be a free-for-all. - And Hannibal will slip away. Will you slip away with him? Part of me will always want to. You have to cut that part out. No, of course, you found him here, not because of the exhibit, but because of the crowd it attracts. You had him, Jack. He was beaten. Why didn't you kill him? Maybe I need you to. I want to be able to draw these streets from memory. I want to be able to draw the Palazzo Vecchio and the Duomo. You won't be coming back here for a very long time. Memories of Florence will be all I have. Florence is where I became a man. I see my end in my beginning. All of our endings can be found in our beginnings. History repeats itself, and there is no escape. You've packed lightly. I packed for you. This is where I leave you. Or more accurately, where you leave me. This isn't how I intended to say goodbye. I imagined it differently. I didn't. I knew that you intended to eat me, and I knew that you had no intention of eating me hastily. Would be a shame not to savour you. I have not marinated long enough for your tastes. When they come for you... And they will come... what will you say of me? I will help you tell the version of events you want to be told. I will help you because you asked me to. You may make a meal of me yet, Hannibal... but not today. Synced and corrected by oykubuyuk www.addic7ed.com Pig tails cut into sections to give the aesthetic of fingers cut at the joint. Finger food. Ha! Hands are how we touch the world. They're tactile... sensual. Remove an arm and your patient will still feel phantom digits. Imagine how Dr. Lecter will feel when he watches you nibble on his fingers. Oh, poetry, Cordell. Poetry. In a ginger-black vinegar sauce. Mmmm. It's mostly skin and bone. - Oh! - The actual fingers will have more meat. Then, there's the marrow. Here it is in a fermented bean sauce. Ah, I prefer the ginger. No, no. Spit. - (spitting) - (Ding!) - (Cordell laughing) - A Buddhist singing bowl. The gong represents the start of a new day. - Buddhists don't eat meat. - This isn't meat... this is man. Papa always used to say meat was a people business. He was a pioneer in livestock production; I'm sure he's eaten someone. I must admit a tremble at the notion myself. I find there's something reassuring about you eating Dr. Lecter. It makes you the apex predator. I like that. ""Apex predator."" We could... Peking duck him. Oh? You have to torture a duck to prepare it. Pump its skin up with air, then glaze it with a hot honey and hang it by its neck until it dries. And then roast until crispy. Transubstantiation. I'm here. Tell me. I feel like I just paid a lot of money for a dead dago. The feces will fly about Pazzi. Better get it out that Pazzi was dirty. They'll take it better if he was dirty. Was he dirty? Except for this, I don't know. What if they trace Pazzi back to you? (disfigured man): Oh, I can take care of that. You took care of Pazzi. I have little interest in the expensive piece of meat twitching on the end of that electrical cord, Dr. Bloom. Might wanna get interested. Hannibal could disappear too well and you'd be left with nothing. (seated woman): Better buy another cop. Better buy the whole department. You must be looking for Hannibal Lecter. One of his patients? No, not a patient. Where is he? Seeing how you let yourself in, forgive me if it's forward for me to ask, who the hell are you? Family. And you've come all the way from home. Who are you? I'm his psychiatrist. Medicinal purposes. You're like his bird. I'm his bird, too. He puts us in cages - to see what we'll do. - Fly away or dash ourselves dead against the bars. You haven't flown away. You are flying right towards him. How does he inspire such devotion? You're his psychiatrist. You could add into what I've learned from my experience with him and from the mute postures of the dead. Were you there? Did you watch as the wild beast within him turned from the teat and entered the world? I met the beast... and I saw him grow. Someone wants to kill him. More than one someone, I'd say. What do you want? I want to cage him. I thought Will Graham was Hannibal's biggest mistake... wonder if it isn't you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to take my medicine. Mrs. Fell I presume? My husband is a doctor. He's been treating my condition. And what condition is that... Mrs. Fell? I get confused. Oh, please. You need to get over yourself, whatever self that is, Bedelia. My name is Lydia Fell. You expect us to believe that you somehow lost yourself in the hot darkness of Hannibal Lecter's mind? That Lydia Fell is some construct? It's you, isn't it? Well, now I'm really confused. I... don't... believe you. You... are not confused... Bedelia. - That is not my name. - Oh, you know who you are and what you've done, and you know exactly how you're going to wiggle out of it. What is this? Sedatives? Hypnotics? Ethanol? Scopolamine? - Midazolam? - Same cocktail Dr. Lecter served Miriam Lass. You've been freebasing your alibi. And I'm not even mad at you. To tell the truth, I'm fairly impressed. Mostly because you're still alive. When this fog of yours clears... - I'd love to hear how you managed that. - You say my husband murdered a chief investigator. Where is the polizia? Shouldn't they be questioning? Don't worry. They will. They sure are taking their time. What could possibly be the delay? Oh, I have an idea. Do you? They're being bought by the same people that bought Rinaldo Pazzi. Interest in my husband is certainly getting competitive. Will? Will? I wonder who'll catch him first. I've made new friends in Italy. They're cleaning up and starting over, so all you need to concern yourself with now is what will happen once Dr. Lecter is in your hands. You've worked so hard to give me what I want. It's only fair to talk about what Margot wants. Come sit on Santa's lap, huh? You know what I want. The biggest regret of my life is taking away your ability - to create it. - Adoption is a nice thing to do. No pedigree in buying a Chinese baby. They're cheaper than shoats. I wish I could give you a Verger baby, our own baby. Yours and mine. We could raise it together. The last time you said you wanted to have a baby, - you removed my uterus. - In my defense, you weaponized your uterus. You shouldn't have been waving it around like a loaded pistol. I brought it on myself. As you so often do, Margot. But there's a possibility that I'm still packing loads of viable sperm. Stumbled across any viable uteruses lately, hm? What are you up to, Mason? I want us to have a baby, Margot. I could be really good to a child. I could take parenting classes. Let's find a way, Margot. Let's find a way to be a family again, hmm? If I saw you every day, forever, Will, I would remember this time. Strange seeing you here in front of me. Been staring at afterimages of you in places you haven't been in years. ""To market, to market, to buy a fat pig. Home again, home again, jiggity-jig."" I wanted to understand you before I laid eyes on you again. I needed it to be clear... what I was seeing. Where does the difference between the past and the future come from? Mine? Before you and after you. Yours? It's all starting to blur. Mischa. Abigail. Chiyoh. How is Chiyoh? She pushed me off a train. Atta girl. You and I have begun to blur. Isn't that how you found me? Every crime of yours... feels like one I am guilty of. Not just Abigail's murder, every murder... stretching backward and forward in time. Freeing yourself from me and... me freeing myself from you, they are the same. We're conjoined. I'm curious whether either of us can survive separation. Now is the hardest test: not letting rage and frustration... nor forgiveness keep you from thinking. Shall we? After you. Mason's ahead of the FBI in the pursuit of Hannibal Lecter. Mason has no intention of ever sharing his lead with the FBI. I do... once he has Hannibal. There is something I need to get from Mason before he goes to prison. Any experience harvesting sperm? (with Italian accent): We cannot locate Dr. Fell. Close attention has been brought to bear on him. We have eyewitness accounts of a bloody figure, matching his description, running from the scene. The Italian public has already decided il Mostro has killed Rinaldo Pazzi. A 20-year-old debt finally paid. The Italian public is right. Il Mostro died in prison. Il Commandator Pazzi had been assigned to investigate the disappearance of two men from the Palazzo Capponi. My husband knew Professor Sogliato. We were at his home many times. We believe your husband was responsible for the disappearances and murdered Pazzi when he came to the same conclusion. If you haven't already, access the ViCAP database at Quantico. You'll find Dr. Fell on the Most-Wanted page, under the name of Hannibal Lecter. The fingerprints you'll pull from Pazzi's noose - will be his. - If you knew Dr. Fell to be Hannibal Lecter, why didn't you bring it to the attention of the Questura? He had a price on his head. Pazzi knew about it, tried to sell him. For that kind of money, I can't blame him. Can you? You've already been questioned regarding Rinaldo Pazzi's murder, Signor Crawford. Since you're not in Florence on official FBI business, that will be all. Not you, Signora Fell. You stay right where you are. This is gonna hurt. The bullet is still inside you. Chiyoh has always been very protective of me. Did she kill her tenant, or did you? She did. Excellent. You dropped your forgiveness, Will. You forgive how God forgives. Would you have done it quickly? Or would you have stopped to gloat? Does God gloat? Often. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. Ugh! Give that a moment. I can almost taste the butter. Taste and smell are the oldest senses and the closest to the center of the mind. (Will): Parts that precede pity and morality. They play in the dome of our skulls, like miracles illuminated on a church ceiling. The ceremonies and sights and exchanges of dinner can be far more engaging than theater. What's for dinner? Never ask. Spoils the surprise. No, no. I don't indulge much in regret, but... I am sorry to be leaving Italy. There were things in the Palazzo Capponi I would have liked to read. I would have liked to play the clavier... and perhaps compose. I would have liked to show you Florence, Will. Soup isn't very good. It's a parsley and thyme infusion, and more for my sake than yours. Have another sip. Let that circulate. Are we expecting company? Wrong floor. - (tick-tock) - (something sizzling) - (louder sizzling) - (Italian song still playing) Will. He is under the table, Jack. Argh! Your husband left you behind. I had no reason to run. I've done nothing wrong. I hold in my hands the photographs taken for Dr. Fell's State work permit. Oh. I also have his French work papers. Looks different with a beard, no? - That is not my husband. - This is Roman Fell. And this is Lydia Fell. I am Lydia Fell. Did you murder her with your husband? Or did you just watch? I... am Lydia Fell. I don't care who you are. I don't care if you're in your right mind or your wrong mind. Understand? Those things are inconsequential. I understand. In this moment, you do not work for the Questura. Hmm... That's a good thing to understand. I do not want to be seen as... uncooperative. How you're seen is entirely up to you. Rescued by the brave Questura or... apprehended. I've never considered myself in need of being... rescued, until now. Is your husband still in the city? My husband was hoping to meet a friend before he left Florence. Where? The nature of the meeting required privacy. They will be somewhere no one is supposed to be. I've taken the liberty of giving you something to help you relax. Won't be able to do much more than chew, but that's all you'll need to do. I didn't have an opportunity to ask you during our last encounter, but did you enjoy the exhibition? A different kind of evil minds museum... Not that different. We were supposed to sit down together at your house in Baltimore, just the three of us. You were to be the guest of honour. But the menu was all wrong. Yes, it was. Jack was the first to suggest getting inside your head. Now, we both have the opportunity to chew quite literally... what we've only chewed figuratively. Hannibal... stop. Stop! Gentlemen, welcome to Muskrat Farm., BELLA: ""These violent delights have violent ends, ""and in their triumph die, like fire and powder, ""which, as they kiss, consume."" Gran? Edward, don't! She'll see you. Hmm. Okay. Gran, I'd like you to meet... Happy birthday, Bella. Happy birthday. I thought we agreed, no presents. Well, the one from me's not wrapped, so it doesn't count. Thas actually great. Thanks, Dad. It goes with this one from your mom. We coordinated. Well, she coordinated me. Is to put your pictures in from senior year. (SIGHS) Senior year. - How'd you get so old so fast? - I didn't. Is not that old. I don't know. Is that a gray hair? No. No way. Happy birthday. Thas really funny. ON RADIO: Another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed dead. Rangers are searching for the killer animal... Situation's a!! Critica! You've got to look first before you go ERIC: Is Bella. Bella! - Hi. - MIKE: I'm... JESSICA: Today's the big day, Bella. A and J essay due. - Oh, yeah. - Wherefore art thou, Bella? ALL LAUGH) Let me take a picture of you guys. My mom wants me to put together, like, a scrapbook full of memories. ERIC: Oh. MIKE: Cool. Yeah. I take them. I'm not in them. - No, no, no, come here. - BELLA: Well, you are today. You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right? ERIC: Don't worry, I'm in the picture. No one will be looking at you guys. BELLA: Thas good. Oh, good. Cullen's here. Well, talk to you later. - Happy birthday. - Don't remind me. EDWARD: Mmm. Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate. - Yeah, but my aging's not. - Your aging? I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that. Its one year older than you. No, it isn't. I'm 109. Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man. Is gross. I should be thoroughly repulsed. Uh-huh. - We have to go to class. - Okay. Wait a second. Someone wants you. - JACOB: Bella! - Jacob! What? I'll leave you to talk. Hello, biceps! You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you. Well, I'm just filling out, Bella. You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more. You should switch schools. You can come hang out with the palefaces. I'm all right. I prefer the rez school's exclusivity. They let any old riffraff into this place. - I see. Then why are you slumming it? - Mmm-hmm. I was just buying a part for the Rabbit. You should really come take a ride when is done. Is it fast? Uh. Is decent. - I'm kidding. - Okay. Good. Hey, happy birthday. Your dad told my dad, so... Yeah, of course he did. I saw this the other day and thought of you. Catches bad dreams. Thas kind of perfect. Thank you. No problem. - Good seeing you. - Yeah, I'll see you later. Bye. So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't? Because I have nothing to give back to you. Bella, you give me everything just by breathing. See? Thank you. - Thas all I want. - ALICE: Bella! - Happy birthday! - Shh, shh! I thought I said no presents. I've already seen you open it, and guess what, you love it. You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place. Come on. Please? Lll be fun. - Okay. All right. - Great! Okay, I'll see you at 7:00. Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing. Sorry, Bella. Happy... Never mind. You can't trust vampires. Trust me. ROMEO: (ON VIDEO) O my love! My wife! Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. Thou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks. And death's pale flag is not advanced there. BELLA: I hate being celebrated. EDWARD: There are worse tragedies. I mean, look at Romeo. Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity. BELLA: Yeah. Though I do envy him one thing. BELLA: Juliet is, like, perfect. If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing. Not the girl, the suicide. Is nearly impossible for... For some people. For humans, a little poison, a dagger to the heart. There's so many different options. Why would you say that? Because I had to consider it once. I didn't know if I'd get to you in time. I had to come up with some kind of plan. What was the plan? That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi. - The what? - The Volturi. MR. BERTY: Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention? Mr. Cullen? Yes, Mr. Berty. ""O here will I set up my everlasting rest ""and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh. ""Eyes, look your last. ""Arms, take your last embrace! ""And, lips, O you, the doors of breath, ""seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!"" Eyes on the screen, people. ROMEO: Thus with a kiss I die. The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family. I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has. - Is that Carlisle? - Yeah. He lived with them for a few decades. Described them as very refined. No respect for human life, of course, but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least. And the law. Above all, the law. BELLA: Vampires have laws? EDWARD: Not very many. And only one thas regularly enforced. BELLA: What is it? EDWARD: That we keep the existence of our kind a secret. We don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously. Unless, of course, you want to die. You gotta stop talking about that. I can't even think about someone hurting you. Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you. And I don't have anything else to be afraid of. Thas not true. Victoria? She'll come for me one day. Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready. I could protect you if you change me. Bella, you already do protect me. You're my only reason to stay alive, if thas what I am. But is my job to protect you. From everyone except my sister. Is time! Is time. Is time. Is time! Your lips are nettles Your tongue is wine You're left as liquid But your body's pine DR. CULLEN: Sorry about all this. - We tried to rein Alice in. - As if that were even possible. - Happy birthday, Bella. - Thanks. I found it in your bag. You mind? Dating an older woman. Hot. - What? - You first, Rosalie. Is a necklace. Alice picked it out. Thanks. Show me the love. This one's from Emmett. Already installed it in your truck. Finally a decent sound system - for that piece of... - Hey! Don't hate the truck. ALICE LAUGHS) Open Esme and Carlisle's. DR. CULLEN: Just a little something to brighten your day. Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately. Ow. Paper cut. Jaz, Jaz. Is okay. Is just a little blood. DR. CULLEN: Get Jasper out of here. I'm sorry, I can't. I'll have to stitch this up in my office. Check on Jasper. I'm sure he's very upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now. Edward. BELLA: I never wanted to have a party. DR. CULLEN: Is not your fault. Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us. How do you do it? Years and years of practice. Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way? No. I knew who I wanted to be. I wanted to help people. It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless. Damned? Like hell? Carlisle, you couldn't be damned. You couldn't. Is impossible. Thank you, Bella. You've always been very gracious about us. So thas it? Thas why he won't change me? Lmagine the situation in reverse. Hmm. If you believed as Edward does, could you take away his soul? You can't protect me from everything. At some point, something's gonna separate us. Is gonna be an accident or illness or old age, as long as I'm human. And the only solution is to change me. Thas not a solution. Thas a tragedy. You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother. Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all? Carlisle told me how you feel about your soul. I don't believe that. So don't worry about mine. You should go inside. Is still my birthday. So can I ask one thing? Kiss me? I love you. Up with your turret Aren't we just terrified? Shale, screen your worry From what you won't ever find Don't let it fool you Down Hey. Just come take a walk with me. We have to leave Forks. Why? Carlisle's supposed to be 10 years older than he looks, and people are starting to notice. Okay, I've gotta think of something to say to Charlie. When you say ""we""... I mean my family and myself. Edward, what happened with Jasper, is nothing. You're right. It was nothing, nothing but what I always expected and nothing compared to what could have happened. You just don't belong in my world, Bella. I belong with you. No. You don't. I'm coming. Bella, I don't want you to come. You don't want me? No. That changes things a lot. But if is not too much to ask, can you just promise me something? Don't do anything reckless. For Charlie's sake. And I'll promise something to you in return. This is the last time you'll ever see me. I won't come back, and you can go on with your life without any interference from me. It will be like I never existed, I promise. If this is about my soul, take it. I don't want it without you. Is not about your soul. You're just not good for me. Not good enough for you. I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long. Please... Don't... Goodbye. Edward. Edward! Edward. I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again. - BILLY: The Cullens left town, Charlie. - Good riddance. Where'd they go? We'll find her, Charlie. - Thanks, Harry. - Charlie! BILLY: Hey. She's all right. I got her. Thank you, Sam. There's a possibility All that I had Was all I'm gonna get BELLA: Alice, you've disappeared, like everything else. Now who else can I talk to? I'm lost. When you left, and he left, you took everything with you. But the absence of him is everywhere I look. Is like a huge hole has been punched through my chest. Bella. BELLA: But in a way I'm glad. The pain is my only reminder that he was real, that you all were. All right. Thas it. What? You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother. I'm not leaving Forks. Bells, he's not coming back. I know. Is just not normal, this behavior. Quite frankly, is scaring the hell out of me... and your mother. Baby, I don't want you to leave. I don't, but just go. Go to Jacksonville. Make some new friends. I like my old friends. - Well, you never see them anymore. - I do. I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow with Jessica. - You hate shopping. - I... I need a girls' night out. All right. Girls' night. Shopping. I like it. Go buy some stuff. BELLA (ON PHONE): Hi, Jessica, is Bella. Yeah, Bella Swan. JESSICA: I don't know why you want to sit through all those zombies eating people and no hot guys kissing anybody. Is gross. Like... And why are there that many zombie movies anyway? 'Cause if is supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy, my cousin had leprosy. Is not funny, you know? And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism? Because don't be so pleased with your own, like, self-referential cleverness, you know? Like, some girls like to shop. Not all girls, apparently. Although I was surprised you even called at all. You know? Like, your depression thing, I get it. I'm totally, totally worried. But after a while is like, - you're still bumming... - CHET: You want a ride, girls? ...and I'm going through stuff, too. You know? Like Mike deciding he just wants to be friends. CHET: Whas up? Look what we found. JESSICA: Is hard, you know? Like, and since when does ""just friends""... BIKER 1: Whas up guys? BIKER 2: Look what we found. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, where you going? Keep walking. This is dangerous. - Dude, come on. - CHET: Come here for a sec! I think I know those guys. CHET: We got beer! We got bikes! Well, they seem great. Can we go? I'm just gonna see something. CHET: Hey, girlie! All right, all right. We got a taker. Turn around. BIKER 2: Shut up! BIKER 3: You shut up! I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else. No, thas cool. I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey. So, what do you say? You promised me, nothing reckless. You promised it would be as if you never existed. - You lied. - You say something, babe? You know what? Never mind. Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Hey, what the hell's wrong with you? Just curious. - I thought that I saw something. - You... Oh. You're insane, actually. Or suicidal. That homeboy coulve been a psycho. I was about to end up in an FBI interview room like some lame TV show. God, that was such a rush. Awesome. So you're an adrenaline junkie now? Thas cool. You can go bungee jumping. You don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle. Crazy. BELLA: Alice, I saw him. Maybe I'm crazy now. I guess thas okay. If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him, then thas what I'll find. Bella! Where the hell have you been, loca? (SIGHS) I brought you something. - Okay. - Is a little crazy. Wow. Scrap metal. You shouldn't have. I saved it from the junkyard. I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth, but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend - to help me out then... - Ah! - Me being the mechanic-type friend? - Thas right. - Since when are you into motorcycles? - Since now. I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless. Yeah, I mean, is completely stupid and reckless. When do we start? Uh. Now. - Please? - (CHUCKLES) All right. Oh, hey, be careful. Those things are actually really heavy, so... Jake, you're, like, buff. How did that happen? You're, like, 16. I don't get it. Mmm-hmm. Age is just a number, baby. What are you, like, 40 now? It feels like that sometimes. That song's good. You don't like it? I don't really like music anymore, kind of. Okay. No more music. So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day, and hopefully we will, we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere. I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you. You? Influence me? Please. Are you... I'm older than you, so that makes me the influencer and you the influence. (LAUGHS) No, no, no. My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you because of your general paleness and lack of know-how. I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me. Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naive? Okay. So where do we stand? - I'm 35. And you might be, like, 32. - Come on. - QUIL: Yo, Jake, you in there? - Is okay. Is just my boys. - Hey, Jake. - Hey. Guys, this is Bella. - Bella, thas Quil and Embry. - Hi. I'm Quil Ateara. So the bike building story is true. Oh, yeah, yeah, I taught him everything he knows. What about the part where you're his girlfriend? Uh... We're friends, you know. - (LAUGHS) Burn. - Actually, remember I said she's a girl and a friend. Embry, do you remember him making that distinction? Nope. So you guys have girlfriends? Thas awesome. Yeah, right. Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom. Yeah, thas still a riot. You want funny, Black? I'll give you funny. Jeez. JACOB: Hey, that hols illegal! EMBRY: I got five bucks on Quil. You're on. All of the astronauts Champagne in plastic cups Waiting for the big hero to show Outside the door he stands His head in his hands And his heart in his throat What can he tell them now BELLA: Dear Alice, I wish I had your real address. I wish I could tell you about Jake. He makes me feel better. I mean, he makes me feel alive. The hole in my chest, well, when I'm with Jake, is like is almost healed for a while. So, Quil keeps asking to come over. I think he likes you a little too much. Oh. Well, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing. You know? Whas up with you and age? I mean, how old was that Cullen guy, anyway? BELLA: But even Jake can't keep the dreams away. Hey, hey, hey! Wake up, Bella. (SHUSHING) You're okay. You're okay. I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not. Can I ask you something? Hanging out with Jacob, that seems to take your mind off things a bit, doesn't it? You know, sometimes you gotta learn to love whas good for you. You know what I mean? Of course, what do I know? I'm just a terminal bachelor. Famous ladies' man. Okay. I'm gonna go to bed. Uh... I love you. If I told you I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you have said? Are you doubting your mad skills? No. Definitely not. I mean, they'll run fine. Is just, maybe if I was smart, I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit. If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes, I'd say that thas really too bad, but that we're just gonna have to find something else to do. Is that Sam Uley? Yeah. Him and his cult. Oh, my God. Did you see that? They're not really fighting, Bella. They're cliff diving. Scary as hell, but a total rush. - A rush? - Most of us jump from lower down. We leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples. You have some kind of beef with him or something? I don't know. They just think they run this place. Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids. - Now look at him. - Thas Embry? - Yeah. - What happened to him? He missed some school. Now all of a sudden, he started following Sam around like a little puppy. Same thing happened with Paul and Jared. Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something. Is kind of starting to freak me out. Well, you should just avoid him. I r y. Okay. - You look scared. - I'm not. All right. - Brake? - That one. Clutch? Good. Gas? Ready? Now, slowly release the clutch. EDWARD: Bella. Stop. Whoa! You all right? I'm gonna go again. Okay. Ah! Whoa! Hit the brake! I wanna go again. Are you trying to get yourself killed? - No. I want to go again. - No. Forget it. No more bikes. Man, your head. Ow. - Yeah. - Oh, my God, I'm sorry. What, you're apologizing for bleeding? Yeah. I guess I am. Well, is just blood, Bella. No big deal. There. What are you staring at? You're sort of beautiful. How hard did you hit your head? I don't know. Les go. ANGELA: I did see something in the woods. Totally. Baby, I believe you. No, he doesn't. He's just trying to get lucky. ANGELA: No, okay. It was jet black and huge. On all fours, it was still taller than a person. A bear, maybe? Or an alien. You're lucky you didn't get probed. ANGELA: Well, I saw it. You know, you're not the only one. My das been getting reports at the station. Like, five hikers have been killed by some bear. But they can't find the bear. Hmm. Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend. MIKE: Um... So? I mean, Bella's back? Yeah, I guess so. All right, thas... Well, welcome. So, listen, now that you're talking and eating again, which, you know, you've got to get that protein in there, I was just wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me. Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I do. Cool. Let me see, we could check out Love Spelled Backwards Is Love. You know, is a dumb title, but is a romantic comedy. - I mean, is supposed to be pretty... - No. No romance. How about Face Punch? Have you heard of that? I mean, thas an action movie. Yeah, thas perfect. Guns, adrenaline. Thas my thing. Okay. We should get a bunch of people to go. Do you guys want to go see Face Punch? ERIC: Face Punch, yeah! Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that. Remember, the trailer's like... - ""Punch faces."" - I remember. (SARCASTICALLY) Yeah! Movie night with Bella. JACOB: So Face Punch, huh? You like action movies? Not really. I heard it sucks. Bad. Are you even old enough to see this movie? I mean, you know, without, like, adult supervision. Right, yeah, well, she's buying my ticket for me. She's buying it. Okay. Jessica bailed, and Angela got the stomach flu, so Eric's taking care of her. - Is just us three. - Great! - Great. - Yeah. MAN 1 ON SCREEN: Put your gun down. MAN 2 ON SCREEN: Put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your frickin' head off. MAN 3 ON SCREEN: Both of you put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your frickin' heads off. MAN 1 ON SCREEN: All right, forget it, les do this! Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up. He's... (SCOFFS) What a marshmallow! You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach. Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit. Yeah. I'll keep my eye open for that. I feel bad. He probably has that flu thas going around. What? I can't hold your hand? No, of course you can. I just think it means, you know, something a little different to you. So... Okay, well, tell me something. You like me, right? And you think I'm sort of beautiful? (SOFTLY) Jacob, please, don't do this. Why? Because you're about to ruin everything. And I need you. Well, I've got loads of time. I'm not gonna give up. I don't want you to, but is just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere. And thas really selfish. You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up. I'm never gonna run right. So I should be fair to you. Is because of him, right? Look, I know what he did to you. But, Bella, I would never ever do that. I won't ever hurt you. I promise. I won't let you down. You can count on me. MIKE: Well, I need to go home. I was feeling sick before the movie. Okay? What is your problem? Right now? You're my problem. Feeling sick? Maybe you need to go to the hospital. You want me to put you in the hospital? Jake! Jake. Jake, the movie's over. What are you doing? You're really hot. Like, you feel like you have a fever. Are you okay? I don't know whas happening. I gotta go. That dude is weird. BELLA: (ON PHONE) Jake, your dad says you have mono. He won't let me visit, but would you call me? Hey, is me again. I just... I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theater. I just wanted to hear your voice, so no pressure. Jacob, please... Call me. Okay. We should be back around 3:00. Hey. Look, I don't have to go fishing today. Yes, you do. Yeah, you do. Go. What are you talking about? Just be careful. Always am. Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella. My kung fu is strong. Jake! Hey! You cut your hair off? And got a tattoo? Bella. I thought you were too sick to come outside or pick up the phone when I call. Go away. What? Go away. What happened to you? Whas... Hey! What happened? Did Sam get to you? Is that whas happening? Sam's trying to help me. Don't blame him. But if you want somebody to blame, how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love, the Cullens? I don't know what you're talking about. No, you know exactly what I'm talking about. You've been lying to everyone. Charlie. But you can't lie to me. - Not anymore, Bella. - SAM: Jacob! Jacob! Look, Bella, we can't be friends anymore. (CRYING) Look, Jake, I know that I've been hurting you. Is killing me. It kills me. I just need... Maybe give me, like, - some time or something. - Look, don't. Is not you. Is not you, is me, right? Really? Is true. It is me. I'm not good. I used to be a good kid. Not anymore. This doesn't even matter. All right? This is over. You can't break up with me. I mean... I mean, you're my best friend. You promised me. I know. I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella. And this is me keeping that promise. Go home and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt. BELLA: Alice, things are... Things are bad again. Without Jake, I just... I can't stand it. I don't see Edward anymore. Will it really feel like he never existed? I will find the place where I can see him again. Bella. Laurent. I didn't expect to find you here. I went to visit the Cullens, but the house is empty. I'm surprised they left you behind. Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs? Yeah. You could say that. Do the Cullens visit often? Lie. Yeah, absolutely, all the time. Lie better. I'll tell them that you stopped by. But I probably shouldn't tell Edward, 'cause he's pretty protective. But he's far away, isn't he? Why are you here? I came as a favor to Victoria. - Victoria? - She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens. Victoria feels is only fair to kill Edwars mate, given he killed hers. An eye for an eye. Threaten him. Edward would know who did it. And he'd come after you. I don't think he will. After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected? Victoria won't be happy about my killing you, but I can't help myself. You are so mouth-watering. - Please, don't. I mean, you helped us. - No, no, no, no. Don't be afraid. I'm doing you a kindness. (SOFTLY) Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, whereas I'll make it quick. I promise. You will feel nothing. Edward, I love you. I don't believe it. - Dad! I saw them. - Whas the matter? - In the woods. They're not bears. - What do you mean ""in the woods""? Bell, what the hell were you doing out in the woods? They're wolves. I mean, they're like huge wolves. Are you sure about that, Bella? Yeah! I just saw them. They were after something. Wolves? You saw them? All right, well, Harry, feel like going hunting? Get some of your guys together? Sure, yeah, I'll just... BELLA: By now, those wolves will be dead, and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected. Victoria. I should go to the station. Yeah, you should. You should go. CHARLIE: Can you just stay in the house? JACOB: (WHISPERS) Bella! You scared me. - What the hell are you doing? - Back up. I'm coming up. Hey. Look, I'm sorry. - For what? - I wish I could explain. But I literally can't. Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone, one that wasn't yours to share? Well, thas what is like for me. But worse. You have no idea how tight I'm bound. I hate this. I hate what they've done to you. I mean, the killer part is, you already know. Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push? The... The story. The story about the cold ones. I guess I understand why thas the only part you remember. There's gotta be something that you can do. No. I'm in it for life. Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while. Just leave, just you and me. You'd do that? I would do it for you. Is not something I can just run away from, Bella. But I would run away with you if I could. I gotta go. They'll start wondering where I am. Come here. (SOFTLY) Please, try to remember. Id be so much easier if you knew. I'll try. But, Jake... Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake. Jake. Edward, I'm scared. You should be. JACOB: Really, is just like an old story. I'm not really supposed to say anything about it. Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves? Bella? I need to see him. He's not in. - OK, I'm sorry, I really need to see him. - Bella! What did you do? - Okay, what did you do? - Hey. - What did you do to him? - Easy! He didn't want this. What did we do? What did he do? Whad he tell you? - Both of you calm down. - Nothing. He tells me nothing because he's scared of you. - Too late now. - SAM: Bella, get back! SAM: Paul, calm down, now! Bella! Run! Jake, run! SAM: Paul! Hey! Take Bella back to Emily's place. EMBRY: Guess the wolf's out of the bag. BELLA: Alice, is it possible that everything is true? The fairy tales and horror stories? Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all? Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay. I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him. Serves him right. No way. Jacob's a natural. You see him phase on the fly? I got five says Paul doesn't touch him. Come on in, Bella. We won't bite. Speak for yourself. I done me wrong And done all wrong All the wrong I've done I'm sure I'll live quite long Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiance? Don't stare. It bugs Sam. Why would I stare? Are you guys hungry? Like I have to ask. Who's this? JARED: Bella Swan. Who else? Hmm. So, you're the vampire girl. So, you're the wolf girl. Guess so. Well, I'm engaged to one. Save some for your brothers. And ladies first. Muffin? Sure. Thanks. Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order. He didn't say anything to me. Thas a wolf thing. Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not. And check it out. We can hear each other's thoughts. Would you shut up? These are trade secrets. Damn it! This chick runs with vampires. You can't really run with vampires. 'Cause they're fast. Yeah? Well, we're faster. Freaked out yet? You're not the first monsters I've met. SAM: Jake's right. You're good with weird. Hey. Sorry. So you're a werewolf? Yeah. Last time I checked. A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene. A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in. Mono. Yeah. I wish. Well, can't you find a way to just stop? I mean, is wrong. Is not a lifestyle choice, Bella. I was born this way. I can't help it. You're such a hypocrite. What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you? Is not what you are. Is what you do. They never hurt anybody. You've killed people, Jake. Bella, we're not killing anyone. Then who is? What we're trying to protect you people from, the only thing we do kill, vampires. Wait, Jake, you can't. Don't worry. We can't touch your little precious Cullens unless they violate the treaty. Thas not what I'm saying. You can't kill vampires. They'll... They'll kill you. Really? We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough. Laurent? And his red-headed girlfriend is next. Victoria's here? Was. We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night. She keeps coming back. We don't know what she's after. I do. Me. Don't worry. We've got this place covered. She won't get near you or Charlie. Look, you've got to be careful. She's fast. You don't know how fast she is. You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting. All right, I'd better go. You gotta go? Yeah. Got a vampire to kill. BELLA: Alice, I'm all right. Until I'm alone. And lately, thas all the time. Jacob's gone. He's hunting Victoria. And Charlie's hunting Jacob. And you're gone. And so is Edward. And there's just nothing now. You got something, Harry? Nope. Nothing. But I realize where I have to go, what I have to do to see him again. A tear in my brain Allows the voices in They wanna push you off the path With their frequency wires And you can do no wrong In my eyes You can do no wrong In my eyes A drunken salesman Your hearing damage Your mind is restless They say you're getting better But you don't feel any better Your speakers are blowing Your ears are wrecking Your hearing damage You wish you felt better You can do no wrong In my eyes EDWARD: Don't do this. You wanted me to be human. Watch me. EDWARD: Please. For me. You won't stay with me any other way. Bella, please. This constant noise all the time Even though you're the only one I see JACOB: Breathe! Breathe! Come on, Bella, breathe! Bella? Bella, can you hear me? Jake? Come here. What the hell were you thinking? I just wanted to see something. Get her home! I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place. What happened at Harry's? Harry Clearwater had a heart attack. Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family. Is he okay? He's gone. Come on. I'll get you something dry and drive you home. 108 degrees over here. God! My hands are freezing. It must be nice, never getting cold. Is a wolf thing. Is not. Is a Jacob thing. You're just warm. You're like your own sun. This is better, now that you know about me. But... You saw what happened to Emily. Sam got angry. Lost it for a split second. Em was standing too close. He'll never be able to take that back. What if I got mad at you? Sometimes, I feel like I'm gonna disappear. Okay, not that you need me to tell you something like this, but I always will. You're not gonna lose yourself. I wouldn't let that happen. How? I'll tell you all the time how special you are. Thank you. For everything. Wait. There's a vampire. How do you know? I can smell it. I'm getting you out of here. Thas Carlisle's car. They're here. Bella, is a trick! Stop! You gotta come with me! They won't hurt me. If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory. Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands. - I can't protect you here. - Okay. Thas okay. You don't have to. You're about to cross a line. Then don't draw one. Please? Alice? - Oh, my God! What are you... - Bella! I'm sorry, I just, I can't believe you're here. Is... Would you like to explain to me how you're alive? What? I saw a vision of you. You jumped off a cliff. Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself? I mean, what about Charlie? - What about... - I didn't try to kill myself. I was cliff jumping. Recreationally. It was fun. I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy. Does... Did you tell him? No. He only calls in once every few months. He said he wants to be alone. Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell? Uh... Thas probably me. Or is Jacob. Jacob who? Jacob's kind of a werewolf. Bella! Werewolves are not good company to keep. Speak for yourself. I had to see you were safe. I thought you couldn't protect me here. Guess I don't care. Well, I'm not gonna hurt her. No, you're just a harmless Cullen. I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you. Victoria? Yeah, Victoria's been around. I didn't see her. I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either. I can't see past you and your pack of mutts. Don't get me upset... - Hey, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. ...or things are gonna get very ugly. I'll give you a minute. Hey. You're not going anywhere. You're gonna come back, - right? - As soon as you put the dog out. Is he... Are there others? How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying? No. Is just Alice. And she can stay as long as she'd like. Well, are the rest coming back? No. Not that I know of. Anything else? Thas it. Well, if thas all, then you'd better go run back to Sam. I've done it again. I keep breaking my promise. We don't have to do this to each other. Yes, we do. (SOFTLY) Bella... Swan residence. He's not here right now. He's arranging a funeral. Who was that? What? Always in the way. Who was that? Bella, step back. - Jake, who was that? - Bella! Bella, is Edward. He thinks you're dead. Rosalie told him why I came here. Why would you... Why didn't you let me speak to him? - He didn't ask for you. - Bella. - I don't care! - Bella. Bella! He's going to the Volturi. He wants to die, too. JACOB: He left you, Bella. He didn't want you anymore. Remember? No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt. What about your dad? I'm 18. I'm legally free to go, and I left a note. Please, Bella, just stay here. For Charlie. Or for me. I have to go. I'm begging you. Please. Goodbye, Jacob. Okay. AIRPLANE WHOOSHING) So you've made up your minds. I'm afraid your particular gifts are too valuable to destroy. But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us. We would be delighted to utilize your skills. Won't you consider staying with us? You know it will happen anyway. Not without cause. Such a waste. I'm guessing you didn't rent this car? I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto. Not today. What? What do you see? They refused him. - So? - He's gonna make a scene. - Show himself to the humans. - No! When? ALICE: He's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest. God, Alice, you got to hurry up. There's Volterra. - Why are they all in red? - San Marco's Day festival. They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city. Is the perfect setting. The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself. (PANTING) We have five minutes. I know, Bella, just breathe. Alice! Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming. If I go, he'll read my thoughts. He'll think I'm lying. He'll rush into it. - Where do I go? - He'll be under the clock tower. Go! Don't! Heaven. You have to move. Open your eyes. Look at me. I'm alive. You have to move. Bella. - You're here. - I'm here. You're alive. Yes. I needed to make you see me once. You had to know that I was alive, that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything. I can let you go now. I never acted out of guilt. I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist. - But you said... - I lied. I had to lie. But you believed me so easily. Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me. I mean, I'm nothing. I'm human. I'm nothing. Bella, you're everything to me. You're everything. I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen. Aro wants to speak with you again. No rules were broken. Nonetheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue. Fine. Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival? The girl comes with us. No. You can go to hell. Come on, guys. Is a festival. You wouldn't want to make a scene. We wouldn't. Enough. Jane. Aro sent me to see what was taking so long. Just do as she says. Go ahead. Don't be scared. Are you? No. - Is she human? - Yes. Does she know? Yes. Then, why would... She wants to be. And so she will be. Or dessert. ALEC: Sister. They send you out to get one and you bring back two. And a half. Such a clever girl. What a happy surprise! Bella is alive after all. Isn't that wonderful? I love a happy ending. ARO: Ah. They are so rare. Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty. How can you stand to be so close to her? - Is not without difficulty. - Yes, I can see that. ARO CHUCKLING) Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch. And now you know everything. So get on with it. You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward. Though you can't read Bella's thoughts. Fascinating. I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well. Would you do me the honor? Interesting. Hmm. I see nothing. I wonder if... Let us see if she's immune to all our powers. Shall we, Jane? - No! - Pain. BELLA: Stop! Stop! Please! Stop! (GRUNTS) Stop! Just stop hurting him! Please! Please! Jane? Master? Go ahead, my dear. This may hurt just a little. Remarkable! She confounds us all. So what do we do with you now? You already know what you're going to do, Aro. She knows too much. She's a liability. Hmm. Thas true. Felix? EDWARD: No! Please! No! No! Please, please! Kill me! Kill me! Not him. How extraordinary. You would give up your life for someone like us. A vampire. A soulless monster. Just get away from her! You don't know a thing about his soul. This is a sadness. If only it were your intention to give her immortality. Wait! Bella will be one of us. I've seen it. I'll change her myself. Mesmerizing. To see what you have seen before it has happened. Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal, Isabella. Go now. Make your preparations. Let us be done with this. Heidi will arrive any moment. Thank you for your visit. CAIUS: We will return the favor. I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon. We do not offer second chances. ARO: Goodbye, my young friends. DEMETRl: Nice fishing, Heidi. Yes, they do look rather juicy. Save some for me. HEIDl: This way, please. Stay together. Stop! Stop! You're here. You can sleep. I'll still be here when you wake up. Bella, the only reason I left was because I thought I was protecting you. I needed you to have a chance at a normal, happy life. It was so easy for you to leave. Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years. And I swear, I will never fail you again. I'm so sorry. - Charlie's coming. - Hey. You okay? I'm fine. Dad, you don't have to worry. You know, last time you said that, you took off. I didn't see you for three days. I'm really sorry, Dad. Bella, do not ever do that to me again. Ever. And you're grounded for the rest of your life. Okay. I'm not technically breaking any of his rules. He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door. I came in through the window. He's not gonna forgive me easily. I know. Can you? I hope you can, 'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you. Come here. Once Alice changes me, you can't get rid of me. She won't need to change you. There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark. No. No. You all know what I want. And I know how much I'm asking for. The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote. - You don't know what you're talking about. - Shut up. Alice? I already consider you my sister. - Yes. - Thank you. JASPER: I vote ""yes."" It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time. Hmm. ROSALIE: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry to both of you for how I've acted, and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother. But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself. And I wish that there'd been someone to vote ""no"" for me. So, no. I vote ""Hell, yeah."" And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way. I already consider you a part of the family. Yes. Why are you doing this to me? You know what this means. You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice. I won't lose my son. BELLA: I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie. Edward, I want you to be the one to do it. He wants to talk to me. JACOB: So you're still alive for now. EDWARD: He thinks is me keeping you away. JACOB: You stay the hell out of my head. Jacob, I know you have something to say to me. But I want to say something to you first, if thas all right. Thank you. Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't. No. You didn't. And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me. I'm still grateful. But I'm here now. I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away. We'll see. Hey, my turn to talk. I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty. I haven't forgotten. What key point? If any of them bites a human, the truce is over. But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you. No. No, I won't let you. You're not gonna be one of them, Bella. Is not up to you. You know what we'll do to you. I won't have a choice. Bella, please, come. Wait. Is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind. Jake, I love you. So, please, don't make me choose, 'cause ill be him. Is always been him. Bella... - Goodbye, Jacob. - No, you don't speak for her! Bella, get out of here. BELLA: Stop! Stop! You can't hurt each other without hurting me. Jake. He's right. You shouldn't become what I am. I can't do this alone. Then, please, just wait. Just give me five years. Thas too long. Then three? You're so stubborn. What are you waiting for? I have one condition if you want me to do it myself. Whas the condition? And then forever. Thas what I'm asking. Marry me, Bella.

Stand it anymore, darling Stand it Meet me on the equinox Meet me halfway When the sun is perched at its highest peak In the middle of the day Let me give my love to you Let me take your hand As we walk in the dimming light Oh, darling, understand That everything, everything ends Meet me on your best behavior Meet me at your worst For there will be no stone unturned Or bubble left to burst Let me lay beside you, darling Let me be your man And let our bodies intertwine But always understand That everything, everything ends That everything, everything, everything ends A window An opened tomb The sun crawls Across your bedroom A halo A waiting room Your last breaths Moving through you As everything, everything ends As everything, everything, everything Everything, everything, everything ends Meet me on the equinox Meet me halfway When the sun is perched at its highest peak In the middle of the day Let me give my love to you Let me take your hand And as we walk in the dimming light Oh, darling, understand, OK... Here we go. Focus. Speed. I am speed. One winner, 42 losers. I eat losers for breakfast. Breakfast. Wait, maybe I should have had breakfast. A little breck-y could be good for me. No, no, no, stay focused. Speed. I'm faster than fast. Quicker than quick. I am lightning! Hey, Lightning! You ready? Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready Ka-chow! Get your antenna balls here! Go, Lightnin'! - Whoo! - You got that right, slick. Uh! Welcome back to the Dinoco 400. I'm Bob Cutlass, here with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip. We're midway through what may be an historic day for racing. Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof. If this gets more exciting, they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth! Right, Darrell. Three cars are tied for the season points lead, heading into the final race of the season. And the winner of this race will win the season title and the Piston Cup. Does The King, Strip Weathers, have one more victory in him before retirement? He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years! Can he win them one last Piston Cup? And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks. He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career. Chick thought this was his year. His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow. But the last thing he expected was... Lightning McQueen! You know, I don't think anybody expected this. The rookie sensation came into the season unknown. But everyone knows him now. Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco? The legend, the runner-up, and the rookie! Three cars, one champion! No you don't. Hey! What a ride! Go get 'em, McQueen! Go get 'em! I love you, Lightning! Dinoco is all mine. Trouble, turn three! - Get through that, McQueen. - Huge crash behind the leaders! Wait a second, Darrell. McQueen is in the wreckage. There's no way the rookie can make it through! Not in one piece, that is. Yeah! Lightning! Oh! Look at that! McQueen made it through! A spectacular move by Lightning McQueen! Yeah! Ka-chow! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! While everyone heads into the pits, McQueen stays out to take the lead! Don't take me out, coach. I can still race! What do you think? A thing of beauty. - McQueen made it! - What? He's not pitting! You gotta get me out there! Let's go! Get me back out there! McQueen's not going into the pits! The rookie fired his crew chief. The third this season! - Says he likes working alone. - Go, go! Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits. Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up. Get ready, boys, we're coming to the restart! Come on, come on, come on! We need tires now! Come on, let's go! - No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas! - What? You need tires, you idiot! Looks like it's gas-and-go's for McQueen today. Right. No tires again. That's a short-term gain, long-term loss, but it's workin' for him. He obviously knows somethin' we don't know. This is it, Darrell. One lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead. He's got it in the bag. Call in the dogs and put out the fire! We're gonna crown us a new champion! Checkered flag, here I come! No! McQueen's blown a tire! And with only one turn to go! Can he make it? You fool! McQueen's blown a tire! He's blown a tire! Go, go, go! He's lost another tire! - King and Chick come up fast! - They're entering turn three! Come on. I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob! Lightning McQueen is 100 feet from his Piston Cup! The King and Chick rounding turn four. Down the stretch they come! And it's, and it's... - It's too close to call! Too close! - I don't believe it! Lightning! - The most spectacular, amazing... - I don't believe it! ...unequivocally, unbelievable ending in the history of the world! - And we don't know who won! - Look at that! - That's very close to call. - Can we play that again? Hey, no cameras! Get outta here! We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results. McQueen, that was a risky move, not taking tires. Tell me about it! Are you sorry you didn't have a crew chief out there? Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing than just winning. I mean, taking the race by a full lap... Where's the entertainment in that? I wanted to give folks a little sizzle. - Sizzle? - Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief? No, I'm not. 'Cause I'm a one-man show. What? Oh, yeah, right. That was a confident Lightning McQueen. Live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz. - Get outta the shot. - Yo, Chuck. Chuck, what are you doing? You're blockin' the camera! - Everyone wants to see the bolt. - What? - Now, back away. - That's it! Come on, guys. - Whoa, team! Where are you going? - We quit, Mr. One-Man Show! Oh, OK, leave. Fine. How will I ever find anyone else who knows how to fill me up with gas? - Adios, Chuck! - And my name is not Chuck! Oh, whatever. Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen! Seriously, that was some pretty darn nice racin' out there. - By me! - Oh, yeah. - Zinger! - Welcome to the Chick era, baby! The Piston Cup... It's mine, dude. It's mine. Hey, fellas, how do you think I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue! In your dreams, Thunder. Yeah, right. Thunder? What's he talkin' about, ""Thunder""? You know, 'cause thunder always comes after lightning. Ka-ping! Ka-pow! - Who knew about the thunder thing? - I didn't. - Give us the bolt! - That's right. Right in the lens. - Show me the bolt, baby! - Smile, McQueen! - Show me the bolt, McQueen! - That's it! That was one close finish. You sure made Dinoco proud. Thank you, King. Well, Tex, you've been good to me all these years. It's the least I could do. Whatever happens, you're a winner to me, you old daddy rabbit. Thanks, dear. Wouldn't be nothing without you. Kch-i-ka-chow! - I'm Mia. - I'm Tia. We're, like, your biggest fans! Ka-chow! I love being me. - OK, girls, that's it. - We love you, Lightning! Hey, buddy. You're one gutsy racer. Oh, hey, Mr. The King. You got more talent in one lug nut than a lot of cars has got in their whole body. - Really? Oh, that... - But you're stupid. - Excuse me? - This ain't a one-man deal, kid. You need to wise up and get a good crew chief and a good team. You ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you, and you let them do their job, like they should. - Like I tell the boys at the shop... - A good team. Yeah... Ka-chow! Ka-pow! Oh, Lightning! If you figure that out you just gonna be OK. Oh, yeah, that... That is spectacular advice. Thank you, Mr. The King. Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in Piston Cup history... A rookie has won the Piston Cup. Yes! ...we have a three-way tie. Hey, that must be really embarrassing. But I wouldn't worry about it. Because I didn't do it! Piston Cup officials have determined that a tiebreaker race between the three leaders will be held in California in one week. Well, thank you! Thanks to all of you out there! Thank you! Hey, first one to California gets Dinoco all to himself. No, not me! No, you rock, and you know that! Oh, yeah! Whoo! Yep! All right! Got it! ""First one to California gets Dinoco all to himself. "" Oh, we'll see who gets there first, Chick. Huh? - Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie. - I don't want to talk about it. Let's go, Mack. Saddle up. What'd you do with my trailer? - I parked it at your sponsor's tent. - What? Gotta make your personal appearance. No. No! No, no, no, no! Yes, yes, yes! Lightning McQueen here. And I use Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula! Nothing soothes a rusty bumper like Rust-eze. Wow! Look at that shine! Use Rust-eze and you too can look like me! Ka-chow! I met this car from Swampscott. He was so rusty he didn't even cast a shadow. You could see his dirty undercarriage. I hate rusty cars. This is not good for my image. They did give you your big break. Besides, it's in your contract. Oh, will you stop, please? Just go get hooked up. - Winter is a grand old time. - Of this there are no ifs or buts. But remember, all that salt and grime... Can rust your bolts and freeze your... Hey, look! There he is! Our almost champ! Get your rear end in here. Lightning McQueen, you are wicked fast! - That race was a pisser! - You were booking! - Give me a little room. - You're my hero! Yes, I know. ""Fred. "" Fred, thank you. He knows my name. He knows my name! Looking good, Freddie! Thanks to you, Lightning, we had a banner year! We might clear enough to buy you some headlights. You saying he doesn't have headlights? That's what I'm telling ya. They're stickers! Well, you know, racecars don't need headlights, because the track is always lit. Yeah, well, so is my brother, but he still needs headlights. - Ladies and gentlemen, - Lightning McQueen! Free Bird! You know, the Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment team ran a great race today. And remember, with a little Rust-eze... And an insane amount of luck, ...you too, can look like me. Ka-chow. - Hey, kid. - We love ya. And we're looking forward to another great year. Just like this year! Not on your life. - Don't drive like my brother! - Yeah, don't drive like my brother! California, here we come! Dinoco, here we come! Oh... oh... uh, I needed this. Hello? Is this Lightning McQueen, the world's fastest racing machine? Is this Harv, the world's greatest agent? And it is such an honor to be your agent that it almost hurts me to take ten percent of your winnings. Merchandising. And ancillary rights in perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ! I didn't see it, but I heard you were great. Thanks, Harv. Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets for the tiebreaker thing in Cali. I'll pass 'em on to your friends. Shoot me the names. - You let Harv rock it for you, baby. - Right. Friends. Yes, there's... OK, I get it, Mr. Popular. So many you can't even narrow it down. Hey, when you get to town, you better make time for your best friend! Break bread with your mishpocheh here! That'd be great! We should totally... OK, I gotta jump, kid. Let me know how it goes. I'm out. What? A minivan? Come on, you're in the slow lane. This is Lightning McQueen you're hauling here. Just stopping off for a quick breather, kid. - Old Mack needs a rest. - Absolutely not. We're driving all night till we get to California. We agreed to it. All night? May I remind you federal DOT regs state... Come on, I need to get there before Chick and hang with Dinoco. All those sleeping trucks. Hey, kid, I don't know if I can make it. Oh, sure you can, Mack. Look, it'll be easy. I'll stay up with you. - All night? - All night long. Uh! Ah-choo! - Hey, yo, D.J. - What up? We got ourselves a nodder. Pretty music. Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man. - Right back at ya! - Yeah! - Oops! I missed. - You going on vacation? - Oh, no, Snot Rod... - He's gonna blow! Ah... Ah... Ah-choo! Gesundheit! One should never drive while drowsy. Uh! Ah! Mack! Mack! Mack! Hey, Mack! Mack! Mack! Mack, wait for me! Mack! Mack! Mack! Mack! Mack... ...wait up! Mack. Mack! Mack! What? You're not Mack. Mack? I ain't no Mack! I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake! Turn on your lights, you moron! Mack... The Interstate! Huh? Not in my town, you don't. Oh, no. Oh, maybe he can help me! He's shooting at me! Why is he shooting at me? I haven't gone this fast in years. I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin'. Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine! What in the blue blazes? Crazy hot-rodder. I'm telling you, man, every third blink is slower. The sixties weren't good to you, were they? What? That's not the Interstate! Ah! Oh! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! No, no, no, no, no, no! Ow! I'm not the only one seeing this, right? - Incoming! - Whoa, man. - No! - Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! My tires! Fly away, Stanley. Be free! Boy, you're in a heap of trouble. We're live at the Los Angeles International Speedway as the first competitor, Lightning McQueen, is arriving at the track. Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl? What's your strategy? What? Did I forget to wipe my mud flaps? McQueen's driver arrived in California, but McQueen was missing. - McQueen was reported missing. - ... to race an unprecedented... Sponsor stated they have no idea where he is. I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate to see anything bad happen to him. I don't know what's harder to find, McQueen or a chief who'll work with him! Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs! They're all asking the same question: Where is McQueen? Oh, boy. Where am I? - Mornin', sleepin' beauty! - Ah! Boy, I was wonderin' when you was gonna wake up. Take whatever you want! Just don't hurt me! A parking boot? Why do I have a parking boot on? - What's going on here? Please! - You're funny. I like you already. My name's Mater. Mater? Yeah, like ""tuh-mater,"" but without the ""tuh"". - What's your name? - You don't know my name? Uh... No, I know your name. Is your name Mater too? What? Look, I need to get to California as fast as possible. Where am I? Where are you? Shoot! You're in Radiator Springs. The cutest little town in Carburetor County. Oh, great. Just great! Well, if you think that's great, you should see the rest of the town. You know, I'd love to see the rest of the town! So if you could just open the gate, take this boot off, you and me, we go cruisin', check out the local scene... - Dad-gum! - How'd that be, Tuhmater? - Cool! - Mater! What did I tell you about talkin' to the accused? To not to. Well, quit your yappin' and tow this delinquent road hazard to traffic court. Well, we'll talk later, Mater. ""Later, Mater. "" That's funny! Ah! The Radiator Springs Traffic Court will come to order! Hey, you scratched my paint! I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man! You broke-a the road! You a very bad car! - Fascist! - Commie! Officer, talk to me, babe. How long is this gonna take? I gotta get to California, pronto. Where's your lawyer? I don't know. Tahiti maybe. He's got a timeshare there. When a defendant has no lawyer, the court will assign one to him. Hey! Anyone want to be his lawyer? Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff! All rise! The Honorable Doc Hudson presiding. Show-off. May Doc have mercy on your soul. All right, I wanna know who's responsible for wreckin' my town, Sheriff. I want his hood on a platter! I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots! No, check that. I'm gonna put him in jail till the jail rots on top of him, and then I'm gonna move him to a new jail and let that jail rot. I'm... Throw him out of here, Sheriff. I want him out of my courtroom. I want him out of our town! - Case dismissed. - Yes! Boy, I'm purty good at this lawyerin' stuff. Sorry I'm late, Your Honor! Holy Porsche! She's gotta be from my attorney's office. Hey, thanks for comin', but we're all set. - He's letting me go. - He's letting you go? Yeah, your job's pretty easy today. All you have to do now is stand there and let me look at you. Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase. Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow! - What the...? Ow! Oh! - Ka-chow! - Please! - I know. I get that reaction a lot. I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand. Agh! Ow! Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you? A little bit, but I'll be all right. OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge. Do what you gotta do, baby. But listen. Be careful. Folks around here are not firing on all cylinders, if you know what I mean. Ka-ching! Ah! I'll keep that in mind. - Hey there, Mater. - Howdy, Sally. - Hi, folks! - Good morning! You know her? She's the town attorney and my fiance. What? Nah, I'm just kiddin'. She just likes me for my body. You look great. You do something different with your side view mirrors? What do you want, Sally? Come on, make this guy fix the road. The town needs this. No. I know his type. Racecar. That's the last thing this town needs. OK, I didn't want to have to do this, Doc, but you leave me no choice. Fellow citizens, you're all aware of our town's proud history. Here she goes again. Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel strung on the necklace of Route 66, the mother road! It is our job and our pleasure to take care of the travelers - on our stretch of that road. - Travelers? What travelers? Ignore him. But how, I ask you, are we to care for those travelers if there is no road for them to drive on? - Luigi, what do you have at your store? - Tires. And if no one can get to you? I won't sell any... tires. I will lose everything! - Flo, what do you have at your store? - I have gas. - Lotsa gas! - OK boys, stay with me. And, Flo, what'll happen if no one can come to your station to buy gas? I'll go outta business and... we'll have to leave town. What's gonna happen if Flo leaves town and closes her station? - Without gas, we're done for! - What? Don't you think the car responsible should fix our road? The only guy strong enough to fix that road is Big Al! Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago. Then why are you bringing him up, you lemon? Oh, he can do it. He's got the horsepower. So, what do you want him to do? Fix the road! - Because we are a town worth fixing! - Yeah! Order in the court! Seems like my mind has been changed for me. - Yeah! - No! Nice ruling. Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner. That's OK, Stickers. You can take Bessie. Man, you get to work with Bessie! I'd give my left two lug nuts for somethin' like that. Bessie? Who's Bessie? This here is Bessie, finest road-pavin' machine ever built. I'm hereby sentencing you to community service. You're gonna fix the road under my supervision. What? This place is crazy! I know this may be a bad time right now, but you owe me $32,000 in legal fees. What? We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice. You gotta be kidding me. You start there where the road begins. You finish down there where the road ends. Holy shoot! Whoa, whoa, whoa! How long is this gonna take? Well, fella does it right, should take him about five days. Five days? But I should be in California schmoozing Dinoco right now! Then if I were you, I'd quit yappin' and start workin'! - Hook him up, Mater. - Okay-dokey. Freedom! Maybe I should've hooked him up to Bessie... ...and then... then took the boot off. Whoo-hoo! Goodbye, Radiator Springs, and goodbye, Bessie! California, here I come! Yeah! Oh, feel that wind. Yes! No. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas? How can I be outta gas? Boy, we ain't as dumb as you think we are. But how did, how did... you...? We siphoned your gas while you were passed out. - Ka-chow. - Ow, ow, ow, ow. - Gentlemen. - Sheriff. Hey, Sheriff. - Why here? - Sono sempre stati qui. - They were better before. - Stai sempre a parlare. - Guido! - Red, can you move over? I want to get a look at that sexy hot rod. You know, I used to be a purty good whistler. I can't do it now, of course, on account of sometimes I get fluid built up in my engine block, but Doc said he's gonna fix it. He can fix about anything. That's why we made him the judge. Boy, you shoulda heard me on Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow. Now, I'm not one to brag but people come purty far to see me get low on the ""Mow-Mow"". Oh! - Aw, man, that's just great! - Hey, what's wrong? My lucky sticker's all dirty. Ah, that ain't nothin'. I'll clean it for ya. No, no, no! That won't be necessary. Hey! Hey, big fella! Yeah, you in the red! I could use a little hose down. Help me wash this off. Where's he goin'? Oh, he's a little bit shy, and he hates you for killin' his flowers. I shouldn't put up with this. I'm a precision instrument of speed and aerodynamics. - You hurt your what? - I'm a very famous racecar! You are a famous racecar? A real racecar? Yes, I'm a real racecar. What do you think? Look at me. I have followed racing my entire life. My whole life! Then you know who I am. I'm Lightning McQueen. - Lightning McQueen? - Yes! Yes! I must scream it to the world! My excitement from the top of someplace very high! - Do you know many Ferraris? - No, no, no, no, no. They race on the European circuit. I'm in the Piston Cup! - What? - Luigi follow only the Ferraris. Is that what I think it is? Customers. Customers! Customers, everyone! Customers! - OK! - Customers? Been a long time. Remember what we rehearsed. Make sure your ""Open, please come in"" signs are out. You all know what to do. All right, nobody panics. Here we go! Van, I just don't see any on-ramp anywhere. - Minny, I know exactly where we are. - Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere. - Honey, please. - Hello. Welcome to Radiator Springs, gateway to Ornament Valley. Legendary for its service and hospitality. How can we help you? - We don't need anything, thank you. - Ask for directions to the Interstate. There's no need to ask for directions. I know where we're going. He did the same thing on our trip to Shakopee. We were headed over there for the Crazy Days, and we... - OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK? - What you really need is the sweet taste of my homemade, organic fuel. No, it doesn't agree with my tank. - Just trying to find the Interstate. - Good to see you, soldier! Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut for your government surplus needs. - Honey, surplus! - We have too much surplus. I do have a map over at the Cozy Cone Motel. And if you stay, we offer a free Lincoln Continental breakfast. - Honey, she's got a map. - I don't need a map! I have the GPS. - Never need a map again, thank you. - How 'bout somethin' to drink? Stop at Flo's V-Eight Caf. Finest fuel on Route 66. No we just topped off. And if you need tires, stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires, home of the Leaning Tower of Tires. - We're trying to find the Interstate. - But you do need a paint job. Ramone will paint you up right. Hey, anything you want! - You know, like a flame job. - No thanks... Maybe ghost flames! You like old school pinstripin'? Von Dutch style? Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch. OK, no. We're gonna be going now, OK? Ow! A little somethin' to remember us by, OK? - OK! - Come back soon, OK? I mean, you know where we are! Tell your friends! OK! Yes. You bet. Thanks again, folks. Bye-bye now. Psst! Psst! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! - I know how to get to the Interstate! - Do ya? - Minny, no. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, not really. But listen. I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar. I'm being held against my will. I need you to call my team, so they can come rescue me and get me to California in time for me to win the Piston Cup. Understand? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, it's the truth! I'm telling you! You gotta help me! Don't leave me here! I'm in hillbilly hell! My IQ's dropping by the second! I'm becoming one of them! OK, don't worry. They know where we are now. They'll tell friends. You'll see. We'll be back for our Hank Williams marathon... - That's good. - ... after a Piston Cup update. Still no sign of Lightning McQueen. Chick arrived in California and today became the first car to spend practice time on the track. It's nice to get out here before the other competitors. You know, get a head start. Gives me an edge. Hoo-hoo-hoo! Ha-ha! Yeah! Hey, McQueen... Eat your heart out. Oh! Let me get this straight. I can go when this road is done. That's the deal, right? - That's what they done did said. - OK. Outta my way. I got a road to finish. - He's done! - Done? - Uh-huh. - It's only been an hour. Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished. Say thanks, and I'll be on my way. That's all you gotta say. Whee-hoo! I'm the first one on the new road! Oh! It rides purty smooth. - It looks awful! - Well, it matches the rest of the town. Oh! Red. Who do you think you are? Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go. That was the deal. The deal was you fix the road, not make it worse. Now, scrape it off! Start over again. Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar. Oh-ho-ho-ho! Is that right? Then why don't we just have a little race? Me and you. - What? - Me and you. That a joke? If you win, you go and I fix the road. If I win, you do the road my way. Doc, what're you doin'? I don't mean to be rude here, but you probably go zero to sixty in, like, what? Three-point-five years? Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about. You know what, old-timer? That's a wonderful idea. Let's race. Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race. You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back. There will be no bumpin', no cheatin', no spittin', no bitin', no road rage, no maimin', no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin', no backstabbin', no road-hoggin', and no lollygaggin'. Speed. I'm speed. Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer. My friend Guido, he dream to give a real racecar a pit stop. - Peet stop! - Uh... The race is only one lap, guys. Uno lappo! Don't need any help. - I work solo mio. - Fine. Race your way. - No pit stoppo. Comprendo? - OK. Gentlemen... ...start your engines! - Hijole! Check that out! - Whoa. Great idea, Doc. Now the road will never get done. Luigi? On your mark, get set... Uno for the money, due for the show, tre to get ready, and quattro to... I can't believe it. Go! Huh? Doc... the flag means go. Remember the fl... Here we go. Go. Doc, what are you doing, man? Oh, dear. It would seem I'm off to a poor start. Well, better late than never. Come on, Mater. - Might need a little help. - Uh... OK. You got your tow cable? Well, yeah, I always got my tow cable. Why? Oh, just in case. Ow! Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. No, no, no, no, no! - Oh, man! - Whoa. - Ow! - Bad trip, man. Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac or was that stingin' like a Beemer? I'm confused. You drive like you fix roads. Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater. Ah! I'm startin' to think he knowed you was gonna crash! Thank you, Mater. Thank you. I can make a little turn on dirt. You think? No. And now I'm a day behind. I'm never gonna get outta here! Hey, se! You need a new paint job, man! - No, thank you. - How 'bout some organic fuel? - That freak juice? - Pass. Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty. Anybody else want somethin' to drink? Nah, not me, Flo. I'm on one of them there special diets. I'm a precisional instrument of speed and aero-matics. ""You race like you fix roads. "" I'll show him. I will show him! Oh, great! I hate it! - Hate, hate, hate, hate it! - Music. Sweet music. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Radiator Springs, a happy place! OK, Bessie, you think that's funny? Great! I'm talking to Bessie now! I'm talking to Bessie! Wow. Mornin', Sally! Hey, look at this here fancy new road that Lightnin' McQueen done just made! Yes! Uh, amazing! Whoa-ho! Yeah! Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't seen you that low in years. I haven't seen a road like this in years. - Well, then let's cruise, baby. - Low and slow. E bellissima! It's beautiful! Guido, look, it's-a like it was paved by angels. Boy, I tell you what. I bet even the roads on the moon ain't this smooth. Doc, look at this! Shoulda tossed him into the cactus a lot sooner, huh? Well, he ain't finished yet. Still got a long way to go. Guido, look at Luigi! This is fantastico! That looks like fun! Mater, I got dibs, next turn! Hey, Luigi, this new road makes your place look like a dump. That crazy old devil woman. Oh! She's right! - Ah! - Guido! Huh. That punk actually did a good job. Well, now... where the heck is he? Sheriff! Is he makin' another run for it? No, no. He ran outta asphalt in the middle of the night, and asked me if he could come down here. All he's tryin' to do is make that there turn. No, no, no, no! Oh, great. Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on. Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's. I'll keep an eye on him. Well, thanks, Doc. I've been feelin' a quart low. This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt. Oh, great. What do you want? You here to gloat? You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard, break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle. Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips. So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert. I'll put it simple. If you're goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turnin' right. Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense. Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you! Or should I say, ""No, thank you""? Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, ""Thank you""! Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot! Turn right to go left. Hmm... Whoa! Oh! Ow! Oh, that... Ow! Turn right to go left. Guess what. I tried it. You know what? This crazy thing happened... I went right! You keep talkin' to yourself, people'll think you're crazy. - Thanks for the tip. - What? I wasn't talkin' to you! - Oh, Guido, e bellissimo! - Che cosa? - It looks great! This is great! - Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo. Oh, Lord. Mater! I need you to watch the prisoner tonight. Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute. What if he tries to run again? Just let him run outta gas and tow him on back. - But keep an eye on him. - Yes, sir! Oh... While I'm stuck here paving this stinkin' road, Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco. My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who's touching me? You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix. You make-a such a nice new road. You come to my shop. Luigi take-a good care of you. Even though you not a Ferrari. You buy four tires, I give you a full-a size spare - absolutely free! - Look, I get all my tires for free. I like your style, eh? You drive the hard bargain. OK. Luigi make you a new deal. You buy one tire, I give you three for free! Oh, would you look at that? Ramone, Ramone! Then Luigi make you a new new deal. No, no, no, no. Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you. - No, no, no, no. No. - This is it. My last offer. You buy one tire, I give you seven-a snow tires for free! Done. You interested, you call me. You know where I am. Ah! Stop! Let me... Oh, Red, you missed a spot. See it right there? - No! No! - On the hood right there. Stop, stop! That's cold! Help! Please! Stop! Thanks, Red. What was that for? - Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone? - Huh? If you do, you gotta be clean. 'Cause even in hillbilly hell we have standards. What, I...? I don't get it. I thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job. So I thought I'd let you stay with me. I mean, not with me! But there. Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone. - And I'd be in my cone, and it's... - Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me. If you want to stay at the dirty impound, fine. - I understand you criminal types. - No, no, no, no. That's OK. - Yeah, the Cozy Cone. - It's newly refurbished. Yeah, it's like a clever little twist. The motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars try to avoid. But now we're gonna stay in them. That's funny. Figure that all out on your own, did you? Cone number one, if you want. Oh... Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there? Oh... That's just a... Oh! Oh, you saw that? Yeah. Just gonna be going. Gonna... Yeah. You know, I knew this girl Doreen. Good-lookin' girl. Looked just like a Jaguar, only she was a truck! You know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her. - What are you talking about? - I don't know. Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you! No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here. Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt. You probably couldn't handle it anyway. Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater. You know who you're talkin' to? This is Lightning McQueen. I can handle anything. - I'm not doin' this. - Come on. You'll love it! - Tractor-tippin's fun. - This is ridiculous. All right, listen. When I say go, we go. But don't let Frank catch you. Go! Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank? Mater! Wait, Mater! OK, here's what you do. You just sneak up in front of 'em, and then honk. And they do the rest. Watch this. Oh! Oh... Oh! Oh... I swear, tractors is so dumb! I tell you what, buddy, it don't get much better than this. Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy. Oh! Oh! Oh... I don't care who you are, that's funny right there. Oh, your turn, bud. Mater, I can't. I don't even have a horn. - Baby. - I'm not a baby. Fine. Stop! Stop, OK? All right. I'll do something. That's Frank. Run! Here he comes, look out! Whoa! Run! He's gonna get ya! Oh! Customers! Oh! Ah, no, no, no. Oof! Oh! Tomorrow night we can go look for the ghostlight! - I can't wait, Mater. - Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya! Oh, boy, you gotta admit that was fun! Oh, yeah... yeah. Well, we better get you back to the impound lot. You know, actually, Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel. Oh... - Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we? - Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding? Besides, she can't stand me. And I don't like her, to be honest. Yeah, you probably right. Hey, look, there's Miss Sally! Where, where? - You're in love with Miss Sally. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you do. - No way. - Way. - Come on, look... - You're in love with Miss Sally! - Real mature. - You're in love! - Real grown up. - You love her. You love her. - Wait... You love her! You love her. You love her. All right. OK. Mater, enough! - Will you stop that? - Stop what? Driving backwards. It's creeping me out. You're gonna wreck. Wreck? Shoot! I'm the world's best backwards driver! You just watch this right here, lover boy. Wee-hee! What are you doing? Watch out! Look out! Mater? Mater! Mater! Hey, take it easy, Mater! Oof! Yee-hee! He's nuts. No need to watch where I'm goin'. Just need to know where I've been. Whoa, that was incredible! How'd you do that? Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want. Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race. What's so important about this race of yours, anyway? It's not just a race. We're talking about the Piston Cup! I've been dreaming about it my whole life! I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it. And when I do, we're talkin' big new sponsor, with private helicopters. No more medicated bumper ointment. No more rusty old cars. What's wrong with rusty old cars? Well, I don't mean you, Mater. I mean other old cars. You know? - Not like you. I like you. - It's OK, buddy. Hey, you think maybe one day I can get a ride in one of them helicopters? I mean, I've always wanted to ride in one of them fancy helicopters. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure. - You mean it? Oh, yeah. Anything you say. I knew it. I knowed I made a good choice! In what? My best friend. See you tomorrow, buddy! McQueen and Sally parked beneath a tree, K- i-s-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Number one. Number one... Ah, number one! - Ah, this is nice. - Hey, Stickers. - I'm sorry. - You scared me. You gotta be careful. I scared myself scaring you scaring me. - I mean, I wasn't like scared scared. - No, of course not. No. - I was more... - I overheard you talkin' to Mater. When? Just now? What, what did, what did you hear? Something about a helicopter ride. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got a kick out of that, didn't he? - Did you mean it? - What? - That you'll get him a ride. - Who knows? First things first. I gotta get outta here and make the race. Uh-huh. You know... Mater trusts you. Yeah, OK. - Did you mean that? - What? Was it just a ""Yeah, OK"", or ""Yeah... OK"" or ""Yeah, o-OK""? Look, I'm exhausted. It's kinda been a long day. Yeah, OK. G'night. Oh... Hey, thank you. What did you just say? You know, thanks for lettin' me stay here. It's nice to be out of the impound, and this is... It's great. - Newly refurbished, right? - Yeah. - G'night. - Good night. Hmm. Will you turn that disrespectful junk off? Respect the classics, man. It's Hendrix! Ah! No! No! I gotta get outta here! Hey, have you seen the Sheriff? Oh! Oh, my gosh. - Hey, what are you doin'? - Get a good peek, city boy? I just need my daily gas ration from the Sheriff. Wait for him at Flo's. Get outta here. I've been trying to get outta here for three days! Hope you enjoyed the show! Whoa, Doc. Time to clean out the garage, buddy, come on. What? He has a Piston Cup? Oh, my gosh. Three Piston Cups? Sign says stay out. You have three Piston Cups. How could you have... I knew you couldn't drive. I didn't know you couldn't read. - You're the Hudson Hornet! - Wait at Flo's, like I told ya! Of course. I can't believe I didn't see it before. You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet! You used to hold the record for most wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk. - You gotta show me your tricks. Please. - I tried that. You won three times! Look at those trophies! You look. All I see is a bunch of empty cups. You know, some automotive yoga could really lower your RPM's, man. Oh, take a car wash, hippie. Yeah, look at my husband, y'all! Whoo! That's your color! - Yellow, baby. - Mmm. You smokin' hot! There he is. Oh, my gosh! Did you know Doc is a famous racecar? - Doc? Our Doc? - Not Doc Hudson. No, no, no, no, it's true! He's a real racing legend. He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet! Fabulous? I never seen Doc drive more than 20 miles an hour. I mean, have you ever seen him race? No, but I wish I could have. They say he was amazing! - He won three Piston Cups! - He did what in his cup? I think the heat's startin' to get to the boy! Well, I'll say! Look how red he is. I think he needs a new coat of poly, man. - Are you sick, buddy? - You are lookin' peaked. He needs a new coat of poly for sure! - Hey! What are you doin'? - It's OK. You can trust me, right? I trust you, all right. It's him I'm worried about. Hmm... I trust him. - Come on, let's take a drive. - A drive? Yeah, a drive. Don't you big city racecars ever just take a drive? Ah... No. No, we don't. Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what? Mm-hm! - And you thought he was gonna run. - Hey, can you believe it, man? He actually thought Doc was a famous racecar! That's so too much! OK, you got me out here. Where are we goin'? I don't know. Whoa! Yes. Oh! Ah-ha-ha! Bleah! Oh! Wow. What is this place? Wheel Well. Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road. This place? Yeah, imagine. Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here. You know, I don't get you. How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this? Well, it's really pretty simple. I was... ...an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and... Oh, you were, were you? Were you rich? - What? - Just... clues to the puzzle. Yeah, OK. Well, that was my life. And you know what? It never felt... happy. Yeah. I mean... really? Yeah. So I left California. Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here. Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in. Well, they all did. And I never left. Yeah. You know, I understand. You need a little R and R. Recharge the old batteries. But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back? I fell in love. - Oh. - Yep. - Corvette? - No. I fell in love with this. Whoa. Look at that. Look, they're drivin' right by. They don't even know what they're missing! Well, it didn't used to be that way. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Forty years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist. Really? Yeah. Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way. How do you mean? The road didn't cut through the land like that Interstate. It moved with the land, you know? It rose, it fell, it curved. - Mornin'! - Nice day, huh? Cars didn't drive on it to make great time. They drove on it to have a great time. Well, what happened? The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving. How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday! Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that. But one of these days we'll find a way to get it back on the map. Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive. I had a great time. It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while. You're welcome. Hey, listen, listen! If anybody asks you, we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK? Wha... what? Oh, man, the paint's still wet! No, no, no, no! Get out of the store! Hey! Don't eat the radial! Here, take-a the snow tires. - Mater! - I wasn't tractor-tippin'! Then where did all these gol-durn tractors come from? - Whoa, boy! - Hey! Hey, guys! There's one goin' this way. I got it. Come here, little tractor, come here. Yeah, that's a good tractor. No, no, no, no, come here. What are you doing? You're not supposed to go wandering off all... ...alone. What are you doin' with those old racin' tires? Come on, Doc, drive. Ah... Yeah. - Wow. - Huh? You're amazing! What are you doin'? Doc, wait! Giddup right in there! Come on, Rusty. Doc, hold it! Seriously, your driving's incredible! - Wonderful. Now, go away. - Hey, I mean it. You've still got it! - I'm askin' you to leave. - Come on. I'm a racecar, you're a much older racecar, but under the hood you and I are the same. We are not the same! Understand? Now, get out. How could a car like you quit at the top of your game? You think I quit? Right. Your big wreck in '54. They quit on me. When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome. You know what they said? ""You're history. "" Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line. There was a lot left in me. I never got a chance to show 'em. I keep that to remind me never to go back. I just never expected that that world would... ...would find me here. - Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them. - Oh, yeah? No, I'm not. When is the last time you cared about something except yourself, hot rod? You name me one time and I will take it all back. Uh-huh. I didn't think so. These are good folk around here, who care about one another. I don't want 'em depending on someone they can't count on. Oh, like you? You've been here how long and your friends don't even know who you are? Who's caring about only himself? Just finish that road and get outta here! Will you turn that disrespectful junk off? Respect the classics, man. Ah... He's done. He must've finished it while we was all sleepin'. Good riddance. He's gone? Well, we wouldn't want him to miss that race of his. - Oh, dude, are you crying? - No! I'm happy! I don't have to watch him every second of the day anymore! I'm glad he's gone! What's wrong with Red? Oh, he's just sad 'cause you left town and went to your big race to win the Piston Cup that you've always dreamed about your whole life and get that big ol' sponsor and that fancy helicopter you was talkin' about. Wait a minute! I knowed you wouldn't leave without saying goodbye. What are you doin' here? You're gonna miss your race. Don't worry. I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up time. Thank you, Sheriff. But you know I can't go just yet. Well, why not? I'm not sure these tires... ...can get me to California. - Peet stop? Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens? I can't-a believe it! Four new tires! I can't-a believe it! Four new tires! Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie! - Would you look at that! - Our first customer in years! I am filled with tears of ecstasy, for this is the most glorious day of my life! All right, Luigi, give me the best set of blackwalls you've got. No! No, no, no. You don't-a know what you want. Luigi know what you want. Blackwall tires. They blend into the pavement. But-a this... Whitewall tires! They say, ""Look at me! Here I am! Love me. "" All right, you're the expert. Don't forget the spare. - Perfetto. Guido! - Peet stop! What did Luigi tell you, eh? Wow, you were right. Better than a Ferrari, huh? Eh... No. Wow! This organic fuel is great! Why haven't I heard about it before? It's a conspiracy, man! The oil companies got a grip on the government! They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man. OK, I'll take a case. Ow! Eh! Ah... Yeah. Ka-chow. - Here she comes! - Places, everybody. Hurry! Act natural. - Hi, Sally. - Buon giorno! All right, what's goin' on? Ladies and gentlecars, please welcome the new Lightning McQueen! Pow! What do you think? Radiator Springs looks pretty good on me. I'll say. Ka-chow. You're gonna fit right in in California. My goodness. It looks like you've helped everybody in town. Yeah, everybody except one. - Hey, is it getting dark out? - What? What'd he say? Let me say that again. Is it getting dark out? Now, what was I supposed to do after that? They fixed their neon! - Low and slow? - Oh, yeah, baby! Just like in its heyday, right? It's even better than I pictured it. Thank you. Shall we cruise? Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to! - No, no, no. - Lizzie! I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him. Hey, Miss Sally. May I have this cruise? - Of course, Mater. - Uh-uh-uh! ...and again and I said, ""No. "" He asked me again, and I said, ""No. "" But, oh, he was a persistent little bugger for a two-cylinder. Finally I said, ""All right, one little drive. "" Oh! - Hey! - Thanks, Mater. Good evenin', you two. Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this. - Is that what I think it is? - Oh, I don't know, Flo. I haven't had a chance to find out. But I am going to find out. Hello. Not that. That. Customers? Customers? Customers, everybody! And a lot of 'em! You know what to do. Just like we rehearsed. It's the ghostlight! We have found McQueen. We have found McQueen! McQueen, over here! - Wait, excuse me. - Is it true you've been in rehab? - Did you have a nervous breakdown? - What? - McQueen's wearing whitewalls! - Your tires balding? Stickers! - Was McQueen your prisoner? - Shoot, no! We're best buds! I ain't braggin' or nothin', but I was in charge of huntin' him down if he tried to escape. Sally! Sally! Will you still race for the Piston Cup? - Stickers? - Sally! Come on, give us some bolt! You're here! Thank the manufacturer! You're alive! - Mack? - You're here! I can't believe it! You are a sight for sore headlights! I'm so sorry I lost you, boss. I'll make it up to you! Mack, I, I can't believe you're here. Is that the world's fastest racing machine? - Is that Harv? - Yeah. He's in the back. - Show us the bolt! - Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites! - Where's the old McQueen? - Actually, this is my good side here. - Harv! Harv! - Give us the bolt! - Harv? - Come on! - Kid, I'm over here! - How you doin', buddy? My star client disappears off the face of the earth! - How do you think I'm doing? - I can explain. I'm doing great! You're everywhere! Radio, TV, the papers! You can't buy this kind of publicity! What do you need me for? That's just a figure of speech, by the way. You signed a contract. Where are you? I can't even find you on my GPS. I'm in this little town called Radiator Springs. - You know Route 66? It's still here! - Yeah, that's great, kid. Playtime is over, pal. While the world's been trying to find you Dinoco has had no one to woo. - Who are they gonna woo? - Chick! Bingo. In fact, check out what's on the plasma right now. - Show us the thunder! - You want thunder? You want thunder? Ka-chicka, ka-chicka! - Hey, that's my bit! - You've gotta get to Cali, pronto! Just get out of Radiation Stinks now, or Dinoco is history, you hear me? Just give me a second here, Harv. No, wait. Where are you goin'? Get in the trailer, baby. Kid! You want a bigger trailer? Sally, I... I want you to... Look, I wish... Thank you. Thanks for everything. - It was just a road. - No. It was much more than that. Hey, kid! We gotta go. Harv's goin' crazy! He's gonna have me fired if I don't get you in the truck right now! - Mack, just... hold it for... - You should go. - I know, but... - Good luck in California. I hope you find what you're looking for. - McQueen, come on! - Sally... - Sally! - Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt! Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt! - Come on, get in the trailer. - Where's the old McQueen? - The bolt! - That's it. That's right, let's go! You're a big shining star. You're a superstar. You don't belong there, anyway. Whoa... Wait... Whoa, whoa, wait, wait! Hey, guys! McQueen's leavin' in the truck! Hey, are you Doc Hudson? - Yeah. - Thanks for the call. - You called them? - It's best for everyone, Sally. Best for everyone or best for you? I didn't get to say goodbye to him. Hello, race fans. Welcome to what has become, quite simply, the biggest event in the history of racing. A three-way battle for the Piston Cup! There's a crowd of nearly 200,000 cars here at the Los Angeles International Speedway. Tickets to this race are hotter than a black leather seat on a hot summer day! The King, Chick Hicks and Lightning McQueen in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all, tiebreaker race. I got a lotta miles on me, but let me tell you somethin'. I never thought I'd see anything like this. This is exciting! In fact, the country has almost shut down to watch what many experts are calling ""the race of the century. "" Hey, King! Good luck in your last race. - You've sure been an inspiration to me. - Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it. - Hey, be careful out there, OK? - Yeah, man. He's hot! Wanna know the forecast? I'll give you the forecast. A 100 percent chance of thunder! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Say it with me! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Hey, you! No admittance without a garage pass. Oh, it's OK. Lightning McQueen knows me! Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day for a race, isn't it? - Absolutely, Mr. Andretti. - And good morning to you, Fred. Mario Andretti knows my name! You gotta let me in now! Sorry, pal. OK, here we go. Focus. Speed. I am speed. Victory. One winner, two losers. Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed... Lightnin'! You ready? Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready. Mack, thanks for being my pit crew today. Don't worry about it, kid. It's the least I could do. After all, ""Gas Can"" is my middle name. - It is? - Ah... Not really. Uh-oh Nelson! Zoom in. Ready, 16? Take 16. And there he is, Lightning McQueen! Missing all week, and then he turns up in the middle of nowhere! In a little town called Radiator Springs. Wearin' whitewall tires, of all things. - Oh! - Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Hey, where you been? I've been kinda lonely. Nobody to hang out with. I mean, except the Dinoco folks. And the twins. Of course. The ones that used to be your fans, but now they're my fans. Listen to what the twins think... Agh! Shoot! Boogity, boogity, boogity, boys! Let's go racin'! Come on, you can do it! Come on, King, make us proud, boy! Fifty laps down, and The King is still holding a slim lead. McQueen's got a run on him! He's lookin' to the inside! Oh! Chick slammed the door on him! Chick's not making it easy on him today. He lost momentum, and now he's gonna have to chase him back down! McQueen spins out in the infield! Just me and the old man, fellas. McQueen just doesn't have it today. - Hey, kid, are you all right? - I don't know, Mack. I don't think I... I didn't come all this way to see you quit. Doc? Guys, you're here! I can't believe this! I knew you needed a crew chief, but I didn't know it was this bad. You said you'd never come back. Well, I really didn't have a choice. Mater didn't get to say goodbye. Goodbye! OK, I'm good. All right, if you can drive as good as you can fix a road then you can win this race with your eyes shut. Now, get back out there! Hot snot, we are back in business! Guido! Luigi! You're goin' up against professional pit crews. - You're gonna have to be fast. - They will not know what bit them! Kid, you can beat these guys. Find a groove that works for you and get that lap back. - Is it? - Oh, wow. That's him! Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet! The Hudson Hornet's back! It appears McQueen has got himself a pit crew. And look who he has for a crew chief! - Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet! - Whoa! Well, dip me in axle grease and call me Slick! It surely is. Wow, this is history in the making. Nobody has seen the racing legend in over 50 years! Hey, Doc! Come look at this fellow on the radio. He looks just like you. - McQueen passes on the inside! - He's nearly a lap down. Can he catch up to them with only 60 laps to go? You're goin' great, kid. Just keep your head on. Vai! Vai, vai! Hey, shrimpie, where did McQueen find you, huh? Those round things are called tires, and they go under the car! Con chi credi di parlare? Ma, con chi stai parlando? No! No, no! You'll have your chance. You will have your chance. Oh, kid's just tryin' to be a hero, huh? What do you think of this? Yeah, that's it, kid. What? Whoa! Git-R-done! - I taught him that. Ka-chow! - Ah! What a move by McQueen! He's caught up to the leaders. Yeah. This is what it's all about. A three-way battle for the lead, with ten to go! Look at that boy go out there! Oh! No, you don't. Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat! - Can you get back to the pits? - Yeah, yeah. I think so. Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in. Don't tear yourself up, kid. We gotta get him back out there fast or we're gonna be a lap down, and we'll never win this race! Guido! It's time. Hey, tiny, you gonna clean his windshield? I don't believe it! That was the fastest pit stop I've ever seen! It was a great stop, but he's still gotta beat that pace car! It's gonna be close. Yeah, baby! He's back in! Peet stop. - Guido, you did it! - Way to go, Guido! This is it. We're heading into the final lap and McQueen is right behind the leaders. What a comeback! A hundred and ninety-nine laps! It all comes down to this! This is it, kiddo. You've got four turns left. One at a time. Drive it in deep and hope it sticks. Go! We'll see about that! McQueen's going inside! - Chick and King are loose! - I think McQueen's out! - McQueen saved it! - He's back on the track! - Float like a Cadillac... - Sting like a Beemer! Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka... Lightning McQueen is gonna win the Piston Cup! Come on! You got it! You got it, Stickers! I am not comin' in behind you again, old man. Oh, no! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah! What's he up to, Doc? What are you doin', kid? I think The King should finish his last race. You just gave up the Piston Cup, you know that? This grumpy old racecar I know once told me somethin'. It's just an empty cup. Darrell, is pushing on the last lap legal? He's not really pushin' him. He's just givin' him a little bump draft. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hey. What? What's goin' on? That's what I call racin'. - Bravo il mio amico! - Way to go, buddy! There's a lotta love out there, you know, man? - Don't embarrass me, Fillmore. - That's my hot rod. Come on, baby, bring it out! Bring out the Piston Cup! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Yeah! Now, that's what I'm talkin' about! Hey, how come the only one celebrating is me, huh? Where are the girls? Bring on the confetti! Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti. What's goin' on? Come on, snap some pictures. I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco! Say it with me. Ka-chicka! - Boo! - Boo! What's wrong with everybody? Where's the happiness? Hey! This is the start of the Chick era! - Thanks, Lightnin'. - You're welcome. - Way to go, King! - You're still the car! You're The King! Yeah! - You made us proud, kid! - Congrats on the loss, me bucko! You got a lotta stuff, kid. Thanks, Doc. Hey, Lightnin'. How 'bout comin' over here and talk to me a minute? Son, that was some real racin' out there. How'd you like to become the new face of Dinoco? But I didn't win. Lightnin', there's a whole lot more to racin' than just winnin'. He was so rusty, when he drove down the street buzzards used to circle the car! Thank you, Mr. Tex, but... ...but these Rust-eze guys over there gave me my big break. I'm gonna stick with them. Well, I sure can respect that. Still, you know, if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know. I sure appreciate that. Thank you. Actually, there is one thing. Whoo-hoo! Hey, look at me! I'm flyin', by golly! I'm happier than a tornado in a trailer park! I think it's about-a time we redecorate. Hi. Lightning McQueen told me this was the best place in the world to get tires. How 'bout setting me and my friends up with three or four sets each? Guido! There is a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store. A real Ferrari! Punch me, Guido. Punch me in the face. This is the most glorious day of my life. Wow. Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda. Mi dicono che siete fantastici. Just passin' through? Actually, I thought I'd stop and stay awhile. - I hear this place is back on the map. - It is? There's some rumor floating around that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar is setting up his big racing headquarters here. Really? Ah, well, there goes the town. You know, I really missed you, Sally. Well, I create feelings in others they themselves don't understand and, blah, blah, blah. McQueen and Sally parked beneath the tree, K- i-s-s... uh... i- n-t! Great timing, Mater! Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee! He's my best friend. What're you gonna do? So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys? I don't know. Why don't we just take a drive? Hmm... Nah. Yeah! Ka-chow! Ah-choo! All right, everybody please keep together now. We is now entering the Doc Hudson wing of the museum. Wow. Unbelievable. That many wins in a single season. He's the real deal, Junior. The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration. Excuse me, son. Is Doc Hudson here today? Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc went out for a drive or somethin'. - Whoo! Whoo! - Yeah! Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy. Not today, old man. I know all your tricks. Doc! Doc! Whoo-ah! Not all my tricks, rookie! Attention! Kiss the pavement goodbye. When I'm finished, you'll have mud in places you didn't know you had! - Yo, I've never been off-road! - Well, that's gonna change right now! About face! Drop and give me 20 miles! Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Go! Man, now I got dirt in my rims! Huh? Look at this! It's my hood! It's my hood! I ain't seen this thing in 20 years! Well, it fits perfectly. How do I look? Ah-choo! Oh, dang. You are a toy car! You are a sad, strange little wagon and you have my pity. Farewell. Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, you loony! Hey, I hate to break up the road rally, guys, but they're here! Birthday guests at three o'clock! Oh, man! Whoever does the voice of that piggy truck, I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor! We're banished, genius! Stuck here in this wasteland without chains! But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble! She needs our help! - You're still not listening! - Ah! Welcome to the Himalayas! Snow cone? Oh, that Abominable Snowplow is quite the comic thespian! Just get in there. Go! Go, go, go! Circus cars? How can you be circus cars? These are the lousiest circus cars in the world, and they're gonna make me rich! Wait a minute here. They're just usin' the same actor over and over. What kind of a cut-rate production is this? Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we please ask someone for directions? No! There's an on-ramp close! I know it! I can feel it!, Well done, boys. Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast. No, no, son. Over here. See the lion? Look at the lion and get the lion. Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight. Da-da. Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK? You see this mark? You and me are the same. When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me. Now let me see you fight. Ready? No, Alakay. No dancing! You just amuse yourself, don't you? You're a strange kid. You're a strange one. I'm... Now, come on, let's try it again. No, Alakay. Stop that right now. Doggone it! It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want. Makunga. You're not challenging me again, are you? Look on the bright side. After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son. Before I kick your butt, let me ask you: Why do you want to become the alpha lion? I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart... ...and I want everyone else to do what I say. We fight on three. One... Pay attention, Alakay. Daddy will show you how it's done. Two, three! - Who's the alpha lion? - You are. Don't you forget it. And that, Alakay, is how you attack... Alakay? That's it. Here, kitty, kitty. This one's a beauty. He'll be worth a few bucks. It just gets easier and easier. Daddy! Alakay! Alakay! Alakay! Da-da! No! No! No! Alakay! - Daddy! - Daddy's got you! Hold on! Da-da! Alakay! Daddy! I've been around the world in the pouring rain Feeling out of place and feeling strange Take me to a place where they know my name 'Cause I ain't met nobody that looks the same I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle I need my peoples, my peoples Take me to my peoples Play that jungle fever Show 'em some love Show love Just gotta have someone Gotta have someone To relate to, to relate to I'm feeling right at home Feeling right at home Feeling right at home Feeling right at home I'm feeling right at home See I been traveling Been traveling forever... - I don't like the looks of this guy. - He's kind of cute. He's kind of a showoff. You think he's cute? Roar!! The King of New York City... ...Alex the Lion! I still think he's kind of a showoff. The guy's an animal. Maybe he should take a break. You know, we could all use a vacation. Come on, where would we go on vacation? I don't know about you, but I want to go to Connecticut! On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight. The escapees were cornered in Grand Central Station. He was a very bad kitty. Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today. Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals. The question on everyone's mind, where are they now? I like to move it, move it He likes to move it, move it She likes to move it, move it - We like to - Move it! Come on! Y'all know this one! It never gets stale! - We like to - Move it! We'll miss you little fuzz buckets! You've been a great crowd! Glad we could introduce you to the toilet. If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first. Seriously though, call. OK? Settle down, everybody. Be quiet! You can't leave without this! Surprise, freaks! Shake it! Shake it. Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone! I'm a lady! Not really! It's me, King Julien! Which of you is attracted to me? Hands up! Hey, freaks! You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you. Oh, no, thank you. Yes, thank you. It's my plane! Until I return with the spoils from the new country... ...Stevie will be in charge! I don't think they like that idea. What are you saying, Stevie? No. Could we? No, you didn't say that! How is that even possible? Naughty little thing! Stevie says... Let them eat cake! King Julien, wait for me! I'm all packed! I have a whole itinerary planned! Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying! Don't let him on. Stop that thing! He's carrying scissors and hand cream! Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in! Get in quick! - Struts. - Check. - Flaps. - Check. - Engine. Coffee maker. - Check. You guys! Oopsie-daisy! That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen. But it'll have to do. Attention. This is your captain speaking. In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye. New York City, here we come! Pray to your personal God this hunk of junk flies. Personal God, hunk? What? We are go, sir. Open the door! I'm outside! If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression. Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat? - No, sir. - OK, boys, launch! Launch! - Launch! - Launch! Gremlin! Hey, Mort. Hi! That was weird. - Somebody's dreaming. - I think I saw Mort on the plane wing. You got Madagascar on the brain. I know I'm gonna miss it. It was incredible. I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it. Like when you bit me on the butt? I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage. It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits. Are the butts next to the croutons? You don't need to be sarcastic. When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program. Breeding program? We reach a point when we want to meet somebody. Settle down, have a relationship. I can see that. What? Like dating? Yeah, dating. Other... other guys? What do you mean, other guys? Darn it! What is holding up that beverage service?! I'm gonna go check. You all keep talking. I'm gonna catch a few winks. It's so funny! I like laughing! It's such a nice experience! To laugh! Do you mind going back? This is first class. It's nothing personal. We're just better than you. Maurice, I'm open! Hit me! - He shoots, he scores! - Is that Vivaldi? - In-flight slave. - Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz? Bring my nuts on a silver platter. We were checking on our drink order. Sorry. Been a little backed up. - I guess I'll go back... - Where's your body? You're freaking me out! Can you please go over there, please? What happened to the separation of the classes? I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad. We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo. Skipper, look. Analysis. Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction. I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic. That too, sir. Right! Rico? Manual! Problemo solved. - We may be out of fuel. - Why do you think so? We've lost engine one... ...and engine two is no longer on fire. Buckle up, boys. Don't look, doll. This might get hairy. Attention! This is your captain. I have good and bad news. The good news is, we're landing immediately. The bad news is, we're crash-landing. When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice. But thanks for choosing Air Penguin. Raise your arms, Maurice! It's more fun when you raise your arms! I can fly! This could be it, Marty! I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend! Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever! - And you won't mind when I tell you... - Tell me anything! I broke your iPod! The buttons were so small! It made me mad! - The horror! - I'm sorry! - I'll kill you, butt-biter! - It was an accident! - An accident! - Butt-biter! I love you, Gloria! I always have! Like you love the beach. Or a good book. Or the beach. Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf. Rico, you've had your fun. Pull up. Gear down. Gently. You just want to kiss the ground. Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister. I said, kiss it! Now just a little brake. Just a touch. I believe that's checkmate. Commence emergency landing procedure. Flaps up! Deploy! Oh, we're here. What in the world? What happened to the plane? What did y'all do to the plane? I'm OK. I'm alive. I can't even sleep for a minute. This is not JFK. Kowalski, casualty report. Two passengers unaccounted for. That's a number I can live with. Good landing, boys. Who says a penguin can't fly? Hey, happy slappers! Is there some reason to celebrate? Look at the plane! - We'll fix it. - How are you gonna fix this? Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape. We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months. - Sixty-nine months?! - No, six to nine months. Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage. - Where'd you get that number? - I want you to reconfigure the design. How do you estimate that? Pretty boy! Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine. Hold on. Who made you king of the plane wreck? Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge. You fix the plane. Who gives you the authority to put me in charge? OK, then I'll remain in charge. Yeah, you will remain in charge. You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair. Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to. - Good for you. - Well, this discussion isn't over. Higher mammals! Stay with us. We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs. Phil! I should wash your hands out with soap. How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?! You know, grit and spit and spit. A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness. That don't sound too promising. You're right. We're stuck here. As long as we're together, we'll be OK. Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home. Behold! The lion! - People! - There is much to see. Moving on. Wait, wait, wait! People! - They'll help us! - Wait up! - People! Stop! - Help us! If you stop, I'll autograph those! I know you! You. It's the bad kitty. How do you like some of that?! Come in, Tokyo! Right in the batteries. You think an old lady can't take care of herself? Next time, I won't go so easy on you! Thank you, dear. Moving on! Are you out of your mind? We need help and you harass old ladies?! Out of my mind? Who's out of my mind now? - See if you can get an operator. - No problem. Out of my mind. We're going home. Message E-4. The service user has roamed outside the coverage area. Please try again later. Am I trippin'? All those zebras... like me. - Where are we? - San Diego. This time I'm 40 percent sure. - I know this place. - I think it's Africa. Africa? It's got to be. Our ancestral crib. It's in our blood. I can feel it! No, it's more than that. It's like... ...dj vu, like I've been here before. It's like Roots! No, it's like... ...dj vu, like I've been here before. How! How! Me Alex! Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird. Then plummet! Smash ground! Go boom! Then here we emerge. We offer only happiness and good greetings. Is he dancing about a plane crash? Yeah. We just... yeah. I thought... Sorry. You came from off the reserve? Way off. From the Central Park Zoo, actually. Don't strain yourself. What's going on here? They say they're from off the reserve. That's impossible. Only people come from off the reserve. You look familiar. Do I know you? How could you survive the hunters? We didn't see any hunters. - What are you looking at? - Me? Nothing. This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed. So skedaddle back to where you came from. Is there a manager we could talk to? I see. You're here to challenge me! What? No! No. That's what it looks like to me! Zuba! Wait. I'm trying to take care of business... Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on. Alakay? Is that you? No, it's Alex. lx. Like New York Knicks. Zuba, look! I've always had that. The vet checked it out. It's kind of a beauty spot, really. A mark. All right, this is a little weird. Honey, he's come home. What? You've come home. Son. Dad. Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad! Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad! I got a mom and dad! My baby's alive! Dad! My son! My son is home! Alakay! Alakay has come home! Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns. This is perfect! I thought you hated Zuba. No, I do. I do. I do. I hate him. Oh, I do. And I'm going to use Alakay, yes. I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all! Giddy-up, feathered horse! Make way! Move out of the way! Stand aside! New York! It's a bit of a dump. Are you sure we're not in New Jersey? Hello, New Yorkers! Your new king is here! This calls for a celebration! Maurice, I think they like me. You've got to love a non-hostile takeover! Chukka-chukka what? Excuse me. I'm Marty. I'm kind of new around here. Hey, Marty! You're a good-looking group! You like to run? Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackin'. That's right! Crack-a-lackin'. You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language. What? You don't have doctors here? Not anymore. Well, what if you catch a cold? We go over to the dying holes and we die. You guys really need a doctor. - We have an opening. - Would you be interested? Me? A doctor? It's raining men. Hallelujah! You all got it going on. Why don't you have a man? You got worms? Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls. Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos. Hey, everybody! I just found out that my son is a doggone king! The King of New York! Show me some of your moves, son. Don't be bashful. All right. This one always knocks 'em dead. Roar! Look out. The King is mad. The King is mad! Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms! Welcome to the herd, Marty! Me? I've always wanted to be part of a herd! - It's one for all... -  And all for all, y'all! How do I look? Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose. Don't worry... it's just a clip-on. Voil! He's a witch doctor! My mother will be so happy. Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you. Here he comes. I like 'em big I like 'em chunky I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy I like 'em round With somethin' somethin' They like my sound They think I'm funky Goodness, girl... you huge. Who's your friend? Or is that your butt? You as quick as you are hefty. So you're Moto Moto? The name's so nice, you say it twice. I kind of like it, fatso. I'll see you around, girl. It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy. Oops! I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son. - What are you talking about? - It's nothing, really. They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride. It's nonsense. I forgot about the rite of passage. What is it? What's this rite of passage? A traditional coming-of-age ceremony. Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills. - A show-of-skill talent show deal? - Yeah. Strutting their stuff. A performance! I think that's up my alley. If it's tradition, I want to do it. Strut my stuff. Earn my mane. I want to be Alaki. - Alakay. - Alakay! Even better. We will hold the rite of passage in the morning! That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay. Where I'm from, we say, ""Break a leg."" That's my boy! I'm a private dancer A dancer for money Any old music will do Beautiful, isn't it? It's amazing. Guys... ...this is where we belong. Operation Tourist Trap is a go. Oh, I like that one. It works on many levels. You guys are a bunch of suck-ups. - That, too. - Absolutely. Stations. Stage one. Go! Oh, no! What have I done? Come on, take the bait. - What happened? - Oh, look at the poor little guy. Is it dead? Stage two! Go, go, go! I will give him the kiss of life. Rico! Rico! Reverse! Gas! Music! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Come back! What is all this rock'n'roll racket?! Is she dead? No! You hoodlums! Good heavens! Are you OK? Lady, I found your pocketbook. My handbag. Such a good boy. Nana can't survive without it. You are one tough cookie. Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers. OK, nobody panic! The best thing we can do is stay together. We'll wait for another tour jeep. It may take hours, but... Where are you going? I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals! I'm too old to die. I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up! Please! We need to stay... ...together. Fine! We'll go that way! Does anyone want a hard candy? - Easy now. - Watch your step. And right here... OK, are you ready? This is where you always slept. Oh, man! - Was this mine? - Look at you. Look at him. Oh, this thing. Look, look! - I remember this! - He remembers. A little harder than... You never slept on the right end. You always slept on the bottom end. Is that? Is that my? Is that me? You had the cutest little paws. Little, little bitty ol' paws. You did that the day we lost you. Wow. I was so young. What happened to me? It was all my fault. I turned my back and... It was not your fault. Your father did everything he could. He tracked those hunters for weeks. Far off the reserve. Finally, I had to assume the hunters... ...well... We thought they'd killed you. But my son fought them off! Don't mess with the King of New York! - That's right! - Keep your chin in. You boys be careful! Watch out before you break something. You used to call this ""foofie."" ""Foofie""? Foofie. He doesn't want that. This is my foofie! Zuba, you better give him his foofie. I mean, no, thank you, thank you. It's perfect. Son, you get your rest. You have a big day tomorrow. You'll need all your strength. I will bring the house down for you. I hope so. Otherwise, your father will have to banish you. Jeez, Mom, really? I know you'll do us proud. You know why? You were born with it. Good night, Alakay. My boy. My own boy. My son's a king. My son's a king. Good night, Mom. Good night, Alakay. Foofie. Look at foofie! My foofie! Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie! No sign of civilization. Everybody appears very tired. I think we're lost. Nana, do you know where you're going? No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face. Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right. - It's people. - How did you get here? - Can you help us? We're lost. - We're lost too. It was awful. A flash of black and white and they were gone. They took the jeep! - That happened to our jeep too! - What do we do? How will we all survive? No food, no water, no shelter. What are we gonna do?! You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature. Gather 'round, children. We're New Yorkers, right? Yeah. We survive the concrete jungle! When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand. - Am I right? - She's right. When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers. - Exactly! - When we need water, we build a dam. We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud! If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere! I'm coming, King Julien! Bad fishy! Bad fishy! No, shark, no! Sit! Why am I laughing? We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule. - How slightly? - Six to nine years. - Sixty-nine years? - No, six to nine years. Private! What happened to our thumbs? Haven't seen them since yesterday. Darn you, Darwin! Nobody goes AWOL on my watch. Private! You're coming with me. Rico! You're coming with me! - We'll bring them in for court martial. - That won't be necessary! We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper. Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. Oh, I doubt that. Enough lollygagging. Let's get to work. There'll be three groups. Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication. Group Bronson handles assembly. Group George Peppard, craft services. Any questions? Good! Let's get to work. I'd like to kiss you, monkey man. All right, but you're so darn ugly. Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart. Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong. Sure, mister. Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck. - You're not nervous, are you? - Nah, it's my thing. In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor. You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing? - Like a dance-off? - Sure. Great. I love that. Freestyle. Who'd be a good match for me? Just to keep things interesting. Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred. But if it was me out there... I'd choose Teetsi. Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting. Makunga, right? Thank you. Anything for Zuba's boy. Go get 'em, tiger. Shake it out. A five, six, seven, eight. Let's go, let's do this. Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony. - Come on, baby! Make Mama proud! - Woman, I'm trying to take... On it, Mom! Who will be the first participant? Me! Oh! Me, me, me! Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me? How about you? The tall, handsome one. Yeah. Choose your opponent. Let me see. I guess I'll pick... ...Teetsi? Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi? That's my boy! He's got some gumption there! Somebody, wake him up! All right, so, Teetsi, come on. Let's do this, huh? Come on, little tsetse fly. Let's see your stuff. Bring it. - Let's dance! - OK. But let me warn you that I am a protg of... ...Fosse and Robbins! Not ""dance"" dance! Fight! Dance fight! You got it. - Is he dancing? - What's he doing? I know that boy is not dancing. This is even better than I thought. Alakay, turn around! No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around. Oh, no. Alakay! Are you hurt? Yeah, I am. Did I... did I win? No, son. How could this happen? You told us you were a king. A king does not get beat. I am a king. I'm the King of New York. It's my stage name. Like for when I perform. Perform? Oh, no, this is horrible! Alakay has failed the test! Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish... ...his own son? Zuba, no. Zuba, yes. Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures. Then I'm no longer the alpha lion. Dad, what are you doing? Dad, no! You can't do this. Who could possibly take Zuba's place? Anyone? Someone? No one? You, sir! I guess not. Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden. Teetsi! Get the hat. As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay! He shall wear this Hat of Shame... ...and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life! Whichever comes last. Shoo, shoo! Get out of here! You should have told us you weren't a real king, son! You never told me I'd have to fight anybody! What did you expect?! I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly advice like, ""Hey, son, it's a fight!"" - You're a lion! - But I never fought another lion! No, I guess not. You dance! And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there! - None of this would have happened... - If you were a real lion. - Zuba! - Yeah, I said it! A real lion. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Saw. Suture. Swab. You're in my light, Stephen. You have a brown spot on your shoulder. That's very observant, Stephen. As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots. OK! That bone will be good as new in a few weeks. So I don't have to pick out a dying hole? No, you got your whole life ahead of you. - Really? - Go out and grab it by the horns. - Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz! - Break a leg! Sweet kid. This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease. Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of. - Don't ask. - Someone's been knotty. This won't hurt a bit. Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spot just like that. - And? - Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe. Wednesday, no Joe? I can breathe! Thanks, doc! So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing? You'll find a cure. You've got at least 48 hours! But I've never heard of it. I mean... I don't have any penicillin. I'll need a CAT scan just to get started! Have a lion look you over. They'd be happy to. Ta-da!! - He has talent. - Stupendous and tremendous. Hollah! Bet you've never seen that one! Knocked 'em dead in New York! - Let's all give it a try! - Let's do it! Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice. You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this. You got it? Ta-da! How did you? You guys got it right out of the box! - If you can do it... ...we can do it. It's in our blood! I always thought I was a bit unique. We are unique! We are like a force of nature! - A million points of light! - And dark stripes! Exactly the same! Exactly the same. Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly? Yes. If we fold it here, here and here. Nice. Oh, man. My dad thinks I'm a total loser. I've ruined my parents' lives. That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'. It is lackin' in the crackin', my friend. I've gotta fix this. So... ...there's... There's something I gotta tell you. Hey, guys. Is this place great or what?! I'd go with ""or what."" Well, I'll tell you what. You're not gonna believe it, but... ...I got a date with Moto Moto. Who's Moto Moto? Oh, he's so big and handsome and big! - Know what ""Moto Moto"" means? - Twins? It means, ""Hot Hot."" ""Hot Hot""? When did you start parlez-ing African? It's in my blood. Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone. Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain? Why are you driving your parade under my rain? Maybe I'll parade in another part of town! Whoa, guys. Main Street's mine! Well, you can have it! And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto... - What are you talking about? - What are we talking about? Melman, just tell her. What? What are you... I don't know what you're talking about. I guess I'll go, then. Don't bother. - Don't get up on my account. - Melman! Gloria! - I thought you guys were friends! - Marty's absolutely right. - Marty? - Marty? Marty? What the heck is going on? You're not? Oh! He was... I thought he... You're not him. He's... Oh. You thought that guy... ...was me? No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on. You thought I was him? You guys kind of do look a little... You look a lot alike. Marty, you look a lot alike. You laugh alike. Talk alike. He has the same speech pattern. It's a little weird, really. I mean, come on. Marty. So you're saying there's nothing unique about me. I'm just like any other zebra. No. Of course you're different! How? OK, I can't tell you apart. Maybe you could wear a bell or something. - A bell?! - OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea. How about a T-shirt that says, ""I'm with stupid""? - I'm not stupid! - Not you, stupid! Him, stupid! You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse, I've been having the worst day of my life. It's always about you, isn't it? My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours. I couldn't tell you apart. So what?! Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away! That's what you do best! Just like back in New York! I'm right here. But you can't tell that, right? Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone! Good, leave! I don't need you to help me solve my problems! You're a dime a dozen! I can't tell which one's Marty! Which one's Marty? Wait a minute. Oh, yeah, I don't care! Nice hat, you showoff! Marty... ...don't go. Giddy-up, giddy-up! Giddy-up, giddy-up! Look, Maurice! The perfect spot for my summer palace! Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff. - Who'd leave a perfectly good head? - What a waste. Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here. I'm terminal, you know? I probably only have another two days left to live. That's a bummer, man. If I, King Julien... that's my name... ...only had two days left to live, I would do all the things - I've ever dreamed of doing. - Like what? I'd love to become a professional whistler. I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it. You know what else I would do? I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it! Easy for you to say. You're a king. Yes. And you are only just a sad little head. There must be something you want to do before you die! - There is this one thing. - What? Tell me. - No, I couldn't. - What is it? I never told Gloria how I feel about her. What is it? Please tell me! I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her. How I've always felt about her. Fine. Don't tell me! Is it a woman? You didn't tell me it's a woman. What are you afraid of? You're a dead man anyway. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. You've got to march right up to this woman. Look her right in the eye. Lean forward. Just a little, or almost all the way. Then you let her lean forward a little until you're... ...just lips' distance away from each other. Then you tell her how much you hate her. Actually, it's more like love her. Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof! You're a real player. Now listen to me. You got to rise up. You hearing me? - He didn't hear you. - I can't hear you! - You got to rise up! - Rising up! - Get out of the hole! - I'm rising out of the ground! - He's rising, Maurice. - I'm rising, Maurice! - Rising! - You go right up to this woman! Do you feel it? - Go up to her face! - Tell the truth! - I'm going to tell her! - Then you say, ""Baby, I dig you!"" Yeah! I'm going to do it! I'm going to do it! I love that happy little head. She love Moto Moto She love Moto Moto She loves me She loves my eyes She loves me She loves my thighs She loves my roundness She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy She love my heftiness She love my zestiness She love me restlessly She love me forever She love me... ...'cause she love me Moto Moto... ...before things get too serious, well, I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here... ...I'd like to ask you... Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal. I have so many questions. I promise the answer will always be yes. Unless no is required. So what is it about me that you find so interesting? You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met. OK. Other than that. Let's see. Yeah, well, you know... you chunky. Right. My gosh, girl, you huge. You said that. Yeah, that's right. We don't have to talk no more. Gloria! Gloria. Melman. Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto. Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you. - I guess I... - It's OK, Melman. Apology accepted. Oh. Yeah, right, that. That's why I... Good. OK. Well, that's it, then. Good. We're kind of busy here, man. No. No, that's not it. Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen. Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman. If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman, I'd give her flowers every day. And not just any flowers. OK? Her favorites are orchids. White. And breakfast in bed. Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides. No crust, the way she likes it. I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend. I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh. She has the most amazing laugh. That's what I would do if I were you. But I'm not, so you do it. OK. What? That was beautiful. Anyways, where were we? I'm ""huge""? Surprised to see me, Makunga? Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion! Is this real enough for you? How about this? This is for setting me up! This is for stealing my dad's job! This is for humiliating my family! And making me look like a fool! Had enough? Sure, fly away! Coward. The water. It's gone. It's never gone dry before. - We'll need a lot more dying holes. - How could this happen? Out of my way! What is going on here?! The watering hole is dry! There's barely water for one of us! - Good observation, Shirley. - I'm Bobby. Makunga, what do we do? Quiet! Listen up! I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis: We'll all have to fight for it. - We can't fight for it. - That's crazy. That's not fair. You'd win! Exactly, Shirley. I'm Bob... Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair. I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion. Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve. If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve. - Off the reserve? - It's too dangerous! Hunters would shoot us! No one leaves the reserve and survives! I left the reserve! And survived. I can do something about this. Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York. I'll travel upriver... - Upriver? - Off the reserve? You? Yeah. I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water. Great! I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set! Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh your mane off. I'll prove you wrong. Maybe you should try a little rain dance. Zuba would know what to do. - Where's Zuba? - You don't care about us. Zuba should be in charge, not you. All right, fine! As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba! Marty? Hey! Marty! Marty? Marty. Where'd you get the fruity hat? Excuse me! Excuse me! Hi. Is Marty in there? Anyone seen Marty? Which one of us is Marty? All right. Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye. Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going? - Can we come? - No. I have to do this alone. You can't leave the reserve! What are you doing? - They'll get your hat. - Hunters are everywhere! Could you leave the hat? Marty! I know you're in there. Before I go, I got something I want to say. You've been a great friend. You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any. I wasn't there for you when you needed me. Just like back at the zoo. What kind of friend does that make me? A pretty lousy friend, I guess. I just want you to know that I... You're one in a million. This is touching. It is touching. So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face? That's right. Gotcha! I see you in there! Yeah, you. You, right there. Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left. That's you, Marty. I know it's you. Know what makes you special? These guys are white with black stripes. You're black with white stripes. You're a dreamer, Marty. Always have been. You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends. Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me. OK, I'm in. Marty, you can't come with me. You don't have a choice. - People are out there! - You're crazy! Come back! The people will get you! Don't lose the hat! Bye, hat! Any water? No, just more diamonds and gold. Don't give up hope. Listen up! I will help you! There's only one way to get your precious water. I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano! What does that do? What does that do? Excellent question. My sacrifice goes in the volcano. The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice. ""Thank you for the sacrifice."" ""Here, have another."" ""No, I've had enough."" ""I'll be insulted unless you have another."" ""I don't want another sacrifice!"" ""Look at you! You're skinny!"" ""No! I've had enough!"" The gods eat the sacrifice. They are grateful. They give me some water, and then I give it to you. What? Does it work? No! I mean, yes. Well, Maurice? Ah, it's fifty-fifty. We'll do it! Excellent! Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods. Any hands! Hands, anybody! I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero. - I'll do it. - Melman? Hurry up! Before we all come to our senses! Melman, what is wrong with you? I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it. Are you nuts? I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going. It was always you. Seeing you every day. That's what kept me going. Melman! Wait! Melman! Melman! Melman! You going to mope like this all day? Don't ""hmph"" me. Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened. Our son came back to us. How come that is not good enough for you? What are you saying, woman? We lost him once, Zuba. Let's not lose him again. Zuba! - Zuba! - Get out of here! What do you want? It's awful. The watering hole is dried up. Dried up? That's impossible! There's nothing left! You're alpha lion, Makunga. What are you gonna do about it? Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it. He's gone upriver. - Off the reserve?! - No! I tried to stop him. I told him it was suicide. He was determined to prove himself to you. You stay here, in case he comes back! Hurry, Zuba! I'm so parched. Is this place starting to freak you out? We'll slip in, find the problem. Hunters will never know we were here. Why are we doing this? Maybe my dad will think I'm... I want to show him I'm a real lion. As opposed to a chocolate lion. I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance. What?! As far as my dad is concerned. As far as people are concerned, you're a hit. In New York. This is Africa... much tougher crowd. Marty, this is it! This is the clog! Come on. Well, there's the water. Stay down. Look at that. Knit one, purl two. It's her. - Is this right? - Very good. Nana, slow down. You're a little tangled, aren't you? No, don't pull. I'll do it. We need dynamite. Got any? Oh, snap! I just used my last stick this morning! - Savages! - Evasive maneuvers! - Serpentine, serpentine! - Squiggly squid maneuver! Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag! No, no! Squiggly squid! Etch A Sketch! That's too complex! Octopus, octopus! - Run, Marty! - I can't leave you here! Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver! Go! Go! Squiggly squid! Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch! Save us We love you OK. OK, OK, OK. - Save us - Melman - We love you - Melman Save us OK, here we go. OK, OK. - Melman - We love you - Melman - Save us Here we go! Here we go! - What's all the hoopla about? - Joe? Joe the Witch Doctor? We thought you were dead! So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots. So Melman's not dying! - Melman's not dying! - Oh, no! Melman! Move! Don't do this! Julien, stop this! This is crazy! Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy! Yes! - Please, Melman! Stop! - Gloria? - You can't do this! - Why not? Because... You can't do this, Melman. First, that hurts. Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway. Melman, I gotta know... ...did you mean those things you said about me? Of course I did. - That's crazy. - It is? It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world... ...to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door. Then it's you and me, neighbor. You and me for the next 18 hours. I'll take whatever you got. - Maurice, what happened? - I believe the fat lady has sung. - What's going on here? - Marty! Alex is in big trouble! We got to get upriver fast! - What about the plane? - Perfect! Come on! The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands. Now, maternity leave. Maternity leave? You're all males. We need that plane for a rescue mission. There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union. I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going. Can't you see these commies have my hands tied? No maternity leave. Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna. All right. You get your maternity leave. Finally. Where we headed? What's going on? Where are we going? Oh, no! Please! Don't put me there! No! This is wrong. You see? You are survivors. Now, how about a nice lion casserole? You can't eat a lion. Don't worry, it tastes like chicken. No, no, no. Don't listen to her. She's out of her mind, people! I'm from New York City! It's me, Alex the lion! From Central Park! Dad! What were you thinking, son? You got no business being out here! Stay behind me. They're New Yorkers. They're just rude and frightened people. Stay back! You'd let your dinner get away? - What are you doing? - The only thing I know how to do. What the heck? Hey, I know those moves. Alex? - It's Alex the lion! - From Central Park! It is Alex! Only one lion can move like that! He's beautiful. I can't believe it. How does he do that? What are you doing? I'm dancing with my son! I think. Don't think, Dad. Feel! Butterfly! I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it! Roar! That was beautiful. Now let's eat! Dad, look out! What the... Alex! Get in! She's got a gun! Get out while we can! - What? - She's got a gun! Get out while we can! Pass it on! He said let's have some fun and take out the dam. Basset hound. Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam. All right! But it's his funeral. - Hard to port! - Aye-aye, Skippy! Bring it on! Bring it on! Come back! That's my dinner! Kowalski, full throttle. Music! - I like this song. - It never gets old. It does have a catchy hook. Come about! Bring her in low! Hold onto your skirts! It's dam-busting time! Hold on tight, baby! Here we go! Tell them no! Pull up! They'll kill us! There's got to be another way! Pass it on! They say no pull up. Kill us. There's no other way. Basset hound. Are you sure? Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's. No! Medic! Ramming speed! Bring it on! Bad kitties. I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work. The science seemed so solid. I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling. It's you! I found you! Mort? Bad fishy! I wonder if the gods like seafood. Let's find out. Look, Maurice. - That was quick. - I did it! I did it! I did it! OK, you did it! Oh, yes!! Look! - It's Alakay! - It's Zuba! You did it! Alakay, Zuba, you did it! Zuba! Alakay! You're back! I'm so glad you're safe! Out of my way. Well, well, well. You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride. And you were kicked out. So don't think that this changes anything. You're right. In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation. A man bag. Very popular where I'm from. - Don't know what to say. - Still be tough and carry your stuff. Does the strap adjust? This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking. But you're still banished. We figured you'd say that. My handbag! You bad kitty! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You deserve this, son. Welcome to the pride. Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you. No, son. To us! My son! The King of New York! That's my baby! Love transcends all differences. We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love. Do you take each other, for better or for worse? For better, please. What a beautiful, weird couple! That's not going to last. Can I kiss the bride? No! Music! - Struts. - Check. - Flaps! - Check. - Diamonds and gold. - Check. - Bye-bye! - We'll miss you! See you later! We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo, or whenever the gold runs out. Come back soon! Mom, let them take their time. New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys? You're right about that! As long as I'm with her... ...and you two, I don't care where we are. She has the most amazing laugh. Love has no boundaries! Looks like you're stuck with us for a while. Dad? What's wrong? I just thought we could hang out a bit and... - You got me! - I got you, son! You got me with my thing. You brought it back around on me. I got you, son! The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty? - Marty? Who's Marty? - Come on. - I don't know no Marty. - You can't fool me. Ain't no Marty here. Marty! I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you. See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever But now that I'm home Hey! Shake the hot things! Shake the hot things! Shake 'em! Shake 'em! Shake 'em! Subtitles by LeapinLar, You know how blind I am without them. Howard, don't cry. Murder. - Good luck, John. - Any contractions? Only the ones you give me. - What's coming? - Red Ball, double homicide. One male, one female. Killer's male, white, 40s. Agatha nailed the time at 8:04 a.m. The twins are a little fuzzy on that. Location's still uncertain. Remote witnesses are plugged in. This will be case number 1108. Morning, detectives. Case number 1108, previsualized by the Pre-Cogs... ...recorded on holosphere by Precrime's Q-stacks. My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard. Good morning. Will the witness preview and validate 1108 at this time? Affirmative. I will validate. Go get them. - Standby. - Time of murder: 8:04 a.m. That is 24 minutes, 13 seconds from now. This is a Red Ball. You know how blind I am without them. All right, Howard Marks, where are you? Howard? Howard, breakfast. Four score and seven years ago... - He looked familiar. - Who? A man standing in the park across the street. - Seen him before. - How can you tell? You're blind without your glasses. Where are your glasses? - In the bedroom. - You're running out of time. - You know how blind I am... I show eight Howard Markses in the District. Sorting by race and age. Run their license and registration. See if I can capture an address here. I was thinking I'd stay home today. - What about your meeting? - I've been working too much. - Can you grab that? - It's unclear. - Six licenses. Where do you want them? - Over here, please. You know how blind I am without them. Got him in the Foxhall. 4421 Gainsborough. Send DCPD. Set up a perimeter. Tell them we're en route. I was thinking maybe I'd play hooky, stay home today. - ""We've come to dedicate a portion..."" - What do you think? - What about your meeting? - I'll reschedule. I've been working too much anyway. - ""But in a larger s..."" Good. - We could have lunch together. - What do you say? - ""We cannot consecrate... - I would love to. - ""The brave men, living and dead... I have an open house at the Ressler place. - Have consecrated, far above our poor power to add or detract. "" I guess that's why you look so nice. Chief! We got a problem with our location. - It's no longer there. - Shit! - Time frame? - Thirteen minutes. Investigator from the fed's here. I don't need some twink from the fed poking around. I wrote it on your calendar. See if the neighbors knew where they went. - Check all relations. - Checking. Just get him some coffee, tell him how I save your ass every day. I got coffee, thanks. Danny Witwer, the twink from the fed. Oops. Gum? I'll give you the full tour some other time. They moved two weeks ago. Nobody knows where. Still searching for family. Time horizon, 12 minutes. He's scrubbing the image, looking for... ...clues as to where the murder will happen. Original running bond brick pattern, Georgian details. Brick was repointed. And that this nation, under God, shall not perish from the earth. Victims are pronounced here, killers here. Beyond that, all we have to run on are the images that they produce. - Show a cop on horseback. - Near the Capitol? - No Maglev system. - The Mall? Georgetown. The Pre-Cogs can see a murder four days out. Why the late call? A Red Ball. Crimes of passion have no premeditation, so they show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events. We rarely see premeditation anymore. People have gotten the message. I show a match with Dwight Kingsley, 18th-century architect. - He did two dozen houses in D.C. - Time horizon, 10 minutes. Look at this kid. In this one, he's on the left side of the man. Yes. So? This one he's on the right. Merry-go-round. It's a park. There's only 16 of these old merry-go-rounds left in the city. Two in Georgetown, one in Barnaby Woods, the others in Woodley. It's gotta be Barnaby Woods. Evanna, flight time? The way I drive? Three minutes after wheels up. - Clear. - Clear. Time horizon, six minutes. Let's go to bed. Let's do it in here. - But the bed is soft. - I'm soft. Shit. Which one is it? - Not the bed. - Come on. I don't want to be on the bed. - We're catching up to the future. - Shut up, Evanna. Jad? - Jad? - Go ahead. - Did he close the front door? - What? Did Marks close the front door? Front door... I didn't wanna be on the bed. - Negative. The front door is open. - Time horizon, 30 seconds. I forgot my glasses. Howard. You know how blind I am without them. Howard, don't cry. Marks! Look at me. Look at me. Positive for Howard Marks. By mandate of the District of Columbia Precrime Division... ...you're under arrest for the future murder of Mrs. Marks and Mr. Dubin... ...that was to take place today at 0800 hours and four minutes. - I didn't do anything. Sarah? - Give the man his hat. Oh, God. Don't put that halo on me. Sarah! - Put your hand on your head. - Help me! I wasn't gonna do anything! I'm Officer Scott with the Precrime Trauma Response Unit. Sit here a minute and listen to me. Your husband is being arrested by Precrime. Oh, God, Howard, no. Howard, don't cry. Howard, don't cry. Please, don't cry. Oh, God. Oh, God. I thought they stopped the murder. That's just an echo. Pre-Cog deja vu, if you will. The really bad ones the Pre-Cogs see over and over again. Wally, erase the incoming. Imagine a world without murder. - I lost my best friend. - I lost my aunt. - I lost my dad. - I lost my wife. Just six years ago, the homicide rate had reached epidemic proportions. It seemed that only a miracle could stop the bloodshed. But instead of one miracle, we were given three: The Pre-Cognitives. Within just one month under the Precrime program... ...the murder rate in the District of Columbia was reduced 90%% . - They were waiting for me. - He was gonna rape me. - I was going to be stabbed. - Right here. Within a year, Precrime effectively stopped murder in our nation 's capital. In the six years of our experiment... ...there hasn't been a single murder. And now Precrime can work for you. We want to make certain that every American... ...can bank on the infallibility of the system. And to ensure that what keeps us safe will also keep us free. - Precrime. It works. - It works. - It works. - It works. - It works. - It works. Precrime. It works. On Tuesday, April 22, vote ""yes"" on the National Precrime Initiative. What's the matter? Can't sleep? - Just need a little clarity. - True that. You want the customary clarity or the new and improved kind of clarity? Give me the new stuff. New and improved clarity. Clarity, clarity. Yes, indeed. Come on. Come on. Don't bust my balls. You've only given me four, and some of these are duds. Sweet dreams, chief. Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. I could use a little juice on my side. What do you think you know? It's like my daddy used to say: ""In the land of the blind... ...the one-eyed man is king. "" I'm home. Overhead. Wall screen. - Sean. - Hi, Daddy. Can you teach me how to run faster? Because all the kids in my class run faster than me. That's good. Keep your knees up. Like that. Like that. High. High. Like that. - See, you're a natural runner. - Gotta keep running. Yeah. Gotta keep running. Gotta keep running. - Will I be as fast as you someday? - Oh, I think you'll beat me someday. - You're gonna beat everybody. - I think you'll beat everyone someday. - I gotta go. Bye. - No, no, no. Wait, wait. - You gotta give me a kiss. - Not on the lips. Only Mommy kisses me on the lips. Yeah, all right. All right. I love you. - I love you, Sean. - I love you, Daddy. Reminds me of Rosarito Beach. Remember? We had 20 dollars and... Waiting in that van so the sun would shine on our vacation. John. John. John, put the camera down. Look, I'm all ready for bed. What is this? No. Put it away. It's time to put the camera to sleep... ...and time to come and take care of your wife. Why don 't you put the camera down and come and watch the rain with me? No? I promise I'll make it a memorable moment. Put the camera down or you're not getting anything tonight. A gentleman at Justice wants to take this away from us. In a week, people will vote on whether or not... ...what we've been doing has been a noble-minded enterprise... ...or a chance to change the way this country fights crime. John... ...watch this Danny Witwer, the observer from Justice. - I met him yesterday. - Let him look around. Answer his questions, but watch him. If there's any problem, make sure we know about it. When the Pre-Cogs declare a killer, their name is embedded in the wood. Since the shape and grain of each piece is unique, they're impossible to forge. You understand the legalistic drawback to Precrime methodology. - Here we go again. - I'm not with the ACLU on this... ...but we arrest individuals who've broken no law. - They will. - The commission is metaphysics. The Pre-Cogs see the future, and they're never wrong. But it's not the future if you stop it. - Isn't that a fundamental paradox? - Yes. You're talking about predetermination, which happens all the time. - Why'd you catch that? - It was gonna fall. You're certain? But it didn't fall. You caught it. Preventing it doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen. You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill, but doesn't. How do the Pre-Cogs tell the difference? They don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do. Why can't they see rapes, assaults, suicides? Because of the nature of murder. Nothing's more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us... ...than the untimely murder of a human. - That wasn't Walt Whitman. Iris Hineman. She developed Pre-Cogs, designed the system and the interface. Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello. - To Hineman? - To them. - Cops aren't allowed inside the temple. - You've never been inside? We keep strict separation so that no one can be accused of tampering. - I'll be the first one to go in then? - Maybe you didn't hear me. - If it's a question of authority... - There is no question. You don't have any. I have a warrant in my pocket that says different. - Show it to me. - Sure. This investigation of Precrime and its personnel is conducted... ...under the direct supervision and permission from the attorney general. I'm here as his representative... ...which means you're now operating under my supervision. Seems you've been left out of the loop. All right, we're ready. Let's go. - Hold it right there. Hold on. - Not cleared for access. Eye-dent: John Anderton. Approved. - Wally. - No, no, no, no. Danny Witwer from Justice. We're to give him the run of the farm. - I can't touch you. - Don't touch anything. - You can't be in here. - Just answer his questions. - Tell me how... - They're sleeping. Sorry. Tell me how all this works. The photon milk acts as both a nutrient supply and conductor. It enhances the images they receive. We call the female Agatha. The twins are Arthur and Dashiell. We scan by way of optical tomography. White-light pinpoints pulse along the length of the headgear... ...and are reread after absorption through their brain tissue. In other words, we see what they see. They don't feel pain. We keep their heads stocked with dopamine. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels. Don't want them to drift off into too deep a sleep. - They can't be kept too awake either. - Don't think of them as human. No. They're much more than that. Science has stolen most of our miracles. In a way, they give us hope, hope of the existence of the divine. It's interesting that some people have begun to deify the Pre-Cogs. Pre-Cogs are pattern-recognition filters. That's all. - Yet you call this room the ""temple. "" - A nickname. The oracle isn't where the power is, anyway. The power is with the priests, even if they had to invent the oracle. You guys are nodding like you know what he's talking about. Well, come on, chief. The way we work, changing destiny and all... ...we're more like clergy than cops. - Jad. - Yeah? Go to work. All of you. Sorry. Old habit. I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop. - My father was proud. - What does he think of your work? I don't know. He was shot and killed when I was 15 at our church in Dublin. I know what it's like to lose someone close. Nothing's like the loss of a child. I don't have any children, so I can only imagine what that was like. To lose your son in such a public place like that... Now we can make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone. - Tell me what it is you're looking for. - Flaws. There hasn't been a murder in six years. This system is... Perfect. I agree. If there's a flaw, it's human. It always is. John. Wally. Can you see? What happened? Her ACTH levels just shot through the roof! - What'd you do? - She grabbed me. Impossible. They're not aware of us. In the milk, all they see is the future. - She looked straight at me. - It could have been a nightmare. - She spoke to me. - To you? What'd she say? ""Can you see?"" You the sentry? Yes, sir, I'm Gideon. You're Chief Anderton. The music relaxes the prisoners. I don't ever see you Precops down here. Am I in trouble? Not yet. I'm interested in a murder. - I got plenty of those. Kill type? - Drowning. That narrows it down. Not too many in here for that. - Victim's Caucasian, female. - This about the Justice Department? I'm supposed to spruce up for a tour they got tomorrow. You like this tie? Stop. Roll back. There. She's a golden oldie. One of our first. Probably before your time. - This is the composite of the three? - That's right. Combined data stream based on all three previsions. - Just show me Agatha's data stream. - For that... ...we go for a ride. My God. I'd forgotten there were so many. And to think they'd all be out there killing people if it wasn't for you. Look at them. Look at how peaceful they seem. But on the inside: Busy, busy, busy. Okey-pokey. Now that is one bad man. He drowned a woman named Anne Lively out at Roland Lake. The killer's a John Doe, never identified. Why is he still a John Doe? Why wasn't he ID'd from the eye scan? Those are not his eyes. He had them swapped out to fool the scanners. You can get it done on the street for a few thousand bucks these days. Okay, so you want just the female prevision. That's right. We don't seem to have her data. Try again. This is odd. See? We have the two previsions. We got what Art saw. We got what Dash saw. But Agatha's isn't here. Probably just a glitch. Tell me about the intended victim, this Anne Lively. Looks like she's a neuroin addict, like our John Doe here. Address history includes the Beaton Clinic. So she cleaned up. Where is she now? I guess glitches come in twos. You finally crawl your way out of one hole just to fall into another. No. Can't let you take that out of here, chief. - It's against the rules. - Anything else against the rules? Careful, chief. You dig up the past, all you get is dirty. The third prevision was what, kind of fuzzy or something? No, the third prevision, Agatha's prevision, wasn't there. That's not all. There are a dozen more cases with missing previsions. You'd think we'd have found the cure for the common cold. - It's stress. - What's this? Herbal tea with honey. I hate herbal tea. Almost as much as I hate honey. Just drink it, before I pour it in your lap. - Can I get you anything, John? - No, thank you. Witwer's scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow. Yeah, give him a tour. - Lara called me. - What? She's worried about you. Quite frankly, so am I. I'm fine. I understand you've been spending a lot of time in the Sprawl. - I go running down there. - In the middle of the night. What if Danny Witwer insisted on a full chem run? I'm fine. The minute Precrime goes national, they are going to take it away. - We won't let them. - No? How is an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them? My father once said to me... ...""You don't choose the things you believe in. They choose you. "" There's a reason you are here. Had Precrime been in place earlier, your loss would have been prevented. Remember, the eyes... The eyes of the nation are on us right now. I'm not the generation anyone listens to... ...but people trust you when you speak of your belief in Precrime. They know that it's a belief born of pain, not politics. I understood that. I may have even encouraged it to help with the cause. But now, your pain is hurting both of us. They're not going to take it away from us. I won't let them. Bingo. - Hi, Daddy. - Hey, buddy. - I made up a club. - Yeah? - We're called the Crescos. - The Crescos. - We made up a soccer team. - Yeah? - We practice at school. - With Connor? Your daddy's in a lot of trouble, Sean. - Wait! - No! Jad, how come you're not with Father Witwer? We're in motion on something. We got a white, male victim, about 5' 10"", 170. He takes a round in the 10-ring and goes out a window. - Red Ball? - Nope. Brown Ball. It's premeditated. Amazing. There's someone within 200 miles still dumb enough to do that. The victim's name is Leo Crow. This is case number 1109. Time of occurrence: Friday, 1506 hours. Start search for Leo Crow. Case 1109, previsualized by the Pre-Cogs... ...recorded on holosphere by Precrime's Q-stacks. My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard. Good morning. Are you ready to preview and validate 1109? - Ready when you are, John. - Standing by. I love this part. I've got no address. No tax returns for the last five years. Check NCIC. Maybe he's got a number. We'll send a protection team as soon as we lock location. It looks like federal housing. Concrete, glass, egg crates. Ouch. About a thousand of those in the District. Fractured images coming in. Numbers nine... Nine, six. Female, senior. She's smoking a pipe. She's laughing. Okay, now I'm inside a room. Windowpanes, aluminum extrusion. Two figures resolving in the room. - Wait! - No... Looks like we got a third party. Wearing sunglasses, just out the window. You're not gonna kill me. Goodbye, Crow. You're not gonna kill me. - Goodbye, Crow. - Wait! Wait. Wait. You say something, chief? No. I'll get this one. We got time on this one, Jad. Mind getting me a piece of cake they're eating? - I'm starving. - Sure, chief. I think I'll get one for myself too. Take your time. Chief Anderton, what is this that I'm seeing? I'm confused about... - Anderton, wait! - Goodbye, Crow. Anderton, wait! Anderton, wait! I like you, chief. You've always been nice to me. Give you two minutes before I hit the alarm. Hold that, please. Thanks. - You're in a lot of trouble, John. - You set me up. I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you've been doping on. Easy. - Easy. - Seems I've found a flaw. What are you gonna do? Possession will cost you six months and your badge. I guess we won't be working together after all. Now put the gun down, John. I don't hear a Red Ball. Lamar. Lamar. - Lamar? - John, what is happening? It's Witwer. He set me up! Stop, just wait. - Witwer! It's Witwer. - Who's the victim? - Somebody. - Who? - Somebody... Leo Crow. - Who is he? I have no idea! I've never heard of him. But I'm supposed to kill him in less than 36 hours. - How could Witwer have access? - Can you fake a cerebral output? - Why would anyone want to? - Can you? - I doubt it. - Would Hineman know? - Now listen, come in. - What? I'll protect you until we get to the bottom of this. Talk to Wally. See if Witwer's gone inside the temple again. Ask Jad for any off-hour eye-dents into the analytical room. Who's Leo Crow? Security lockdown enabled. Revised destination: Office. Lamar, they found me. Is there any way to override the lockdown? - No, no, no. - No? I'll meet you anywhere you say. You can come to my house, John. I can't. They'll get me. I'm not gonna get haloed. You can't run. Everybody runs. - Oh, my God! - Hey, hey. Oh, my gosh, are you okay? I'll bring him in. Unharmed. You're not gonna do that. I'm taking control. What? Fletcher is second in command. It's his show to run. You can observe. - Do it. Find him. - Yes, sir. He came to see you the other day right before he was tagged. - What did you talk about? - The Mets. John doesn't think they have a deep enough pitching roster. Why are you protecting him? You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing. - The man lost a child, for chrissake. - Six years ago. - What did you talk about? - None of your business. It's my business. Investigation of a supervising officer for a capital crime... ...falls under federal jurisdiction so as to rule out any conspiracy. - He's my suspect. - He's my subordinate. Call the attorney general. I'm sure he'd clarify the issue for you. I don't want John Anderton hurt. I'm going to enjoy working here. A road diverges in the desert. Lexus. The road you're on, John Anderton, is the one less-traveled. - Make sure you... - Diamonds... Good evening, John Anderton. John Anderton! You could use a Guinness right about now. - John Anderton... - Escape from it all. Get away, John Anderton. Forget your troubles. He's been eye-dented on the Metro. The train stops at 20th and 33rd. Send units to each location. - Better make 20th. - Have faith. Fire them up! - Hey, Fletch. - Hey, John. - That was a rough landing. - Yeah. - Work on that. - It's the shit knee of mine. - Yeah. - Don't do it. Hey, don't do this. John? Don't run. You don't have to chase me. You don't have to run. Everybody runs, Fletch. You know we'll catch you. Everybody runs. - It doesn't have to be like this, John. - Everybody runs. Get your sick-sticks ready. Everybody runs, Fletch. Slow down, chief. Just take it easy. No sudden moves, chief. John, it's okay. - Fletch... - Easy does it, chief. Got a grip? - Got a grip? - Yeah. Anderton! Go away! Get out of my kitchen! Get out of my house! Get out of my house! Go! - Get them out of here! - Anderton, stop! Pull him off me, Fletcher. Get him off me. Get him out of here! What's the matter with you?! Get out of my house! Go! By mandate of the District of Columbia, I'm placing you under arrest for... Go to sleep. You two stay with me! Dr. Hineman. You're trespassing. I don't have visitors. That would be from the doll's eye, the vine... ...the baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall. It's not a true doll's eye. It's a little hybrid I designed. Once the poison gets into your bloodstream, you'll start to see... ...the most extraordinary display of blue objects. This just isn't your week, is it? Chief Anderton. I'm not a killer. You better drink this. Soon you won't be able to swallow, and then you'll be totally buggered. All of it. Okay, now take a minute to right yourself. Just what is it you think I can do for you? You could tell me how someone can fake a prevision. How would I know that? Because you invented Precrime. What's so funny? If the consequences of several genetic mistakes and science gone haywire... ...can be called an invention, then I invented Precrime. - You don't seem proud. - I'm not. I was trying to heal them, not turn them into something else. - Heal who? - The innocents we use to stop the guilty. You're talking about the Pre-Cogs. You think they came from a test tube? They are merely the ones who survived. I was doing genetic research, treating children of drug addicts. This was 10 years ago, when neuroin first hit the streets. It was impure, not the engineered cocktail popular among the educated. All of these kids were born with severe brain damage. Most died before age 12. Those few who survived, they had a gift. I call it a gift. For them, it was more like a cosmic joke. They would wake up in the night, curled in the corner... ...screaming, clawing at the walls. Because when these children closed their eyes at night... ...they dreamt only of murder over and over, one after the other. It didn't take for us long to realize that the real nightmare was... ...that these dreams were about to come true, these murders were happening. You say some of the children died? So many of them. Despite what we did for them. Or maybe because of what we did to them. But it doesn't matter. It's a perfect system now, isn't it? I'm not going to commit murder. I've never met the man I'm supposed to kill. And yet a chain of events has started that will lead you to his murder. - Not if I stay away from him. - Can you avoid a man you've never met? - You won't help? - I can't help you. Nobody can. The Pre-Cogs are never wrong. But occasionally... ...they do disagree. What? Most of the time, all three Pre-Cogs will see an event in the same way... ...but once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the others. Jesus Christ. Why didn't I know about this? Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur. Why? For Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility. Who wants a justice system that instills doubt? It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt. Are you saying I've haloed innocent people? I'm saying that every so often, those accused of a Precrime... ...just might have an alternate future. Does Burgess know about this, about this Minority Report? I used to joke with Lamar that we were the parents of Precrime. Parents often see their children as they want them to be and not as they are. Answer my question: Does Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report? Yes, of course, he knew. But at the time, we felt their existence was an insignificant variable. Insignificant to you, maybe. But what about those people that I put away with alternate futures? - My God, if the country knew... - The system would collapse. - I believe in that system. - Do you really? You wanna bring it down. You will bring it down if you manage to kill your victim. That'll be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime didn't work. - I'm not gonna kill anybody. - Hold that thought. - Why should I trust you? - You shouldn't trust anyone. Certainly not the attorney general, who wants it all for himself. And not the young federal agent, who wants your job. Not even the old man who just wants to hang on to what he created. Don't trust anyone. Just find the Minority Report. You said the Minority Report is destroyed. The record is destroyed. The original report still exists. I designed it so the report is stored in a safe place, but not declared. What safe place is that? The safest place there is. Where is it? Inside the Pre-Cog who predicted it. All you have to do is download it, darling. That's all, huh? Just walk into Precrime, get into the temple... ...somehow tap into these Pre-Cogs and download this Minority Report. - If you have one. - And then walk out. Actually, you'll have to run out. But yes, that's what you have to do. You're insane. Or you think I am. I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times before I get within 10 miles of Precrime. Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark. As a policeman... Excuse me, as a former policeman... ...I'm sure that you know all sorts of people... ...who can help you out in this regard. It's funny how all living organisms are alike. When the chips are down, when the pressure is on... ...every creature on the face of the earth... ...is interested in one thing and one thing only: Its own survival. Find the Minority Report. How do I even know which one has it? It's always in the more gifted of the three. Which one is that? The female. We've got three men in a room. The victim is here... ...John is here, and this unidentified male, at the window. The adjacent building suggests public housing, which means... - There's thousands like this one. - They're everywhere. But he doesn't go there to kill Crow for another 22 hours. This is Chief Anderton's space. - He's not here. - He'll be back. I doubt that. I'm betting he's somewhere in the Sprawl. He's smart enough to go where billboards can't ID him. There's fewer consumers, which means fewer scanners. - Why won't he just run? - Because he thinks he's innocent. We concentrate on the Sprawl. We do fly-overs in ships, with two spyder teams on the ground. Thermal scan the entire area. Read anything with eyes and a heartbeat. Where is she? Started blowing buttons for no reason whatsoever, and I knew that. This damn cold. Don't worry. I could cut open your chest and sew a dead cat in there... ...you wouldn't get an infection. Not with the antibios I'll shoot into you. That's comforting. You do understand I can't just give you new irises? Please, don't touch. Because the scanners would read the new scar tissue, alarms will go off... ...and large men with guns will appear. What was that? What was that? - It's anesthesia. It's all downhill... - You always sneak up on your patients? You wouldn't break the hand of a violinist before the concert. Please, relax. All I'm trying to tell you is that I'll have to remove your eyes completely. I know. - I have to replace them with new ones. - I know. But I wanna keep the old ones. - Why? - Because my mother gave them to me. What's it to you? You can't resell them. Whatever you say. It's your money. Let me introduce my gorgeous assistant, Miss Van Eyck. - This is not a lot of money. - It's all that I could safely move. Okay. - What did you give me? - Smile medicine. Tell you what, since we go way back... ...why don't I give you my old pal discount? What do you say? You don't remember me, do you? - We know each other? - Yes, we do. From where? D.C.? - Baltimore. The East Side. - Baltimore? We go way back. Solomon P. Eddie, M.D. I was a plastic surgeon. You remember? Specialized in burn victims, mostly women. - I put you away. - Yeah, you did. You made those tapes. They were performance pieces. - You set your patients on fire. - I put them out. Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we? The future's so much more interesting than the past, don't you think? Miss Van Eyck. I'm afraid she's already smitten. She only has eyes for you. I know what you're thinking, John: How can I do what I do now? Let's say that I spent an awful lot of time in the prison library. That was a great way to avoid the more unpleasant aspects of prison life. Confinement was a real education, a real... ...eye-opener. For true enlightenment, there's nothing quite like... ...well, let's say, taking a shower while this large fellow... ...with an attitude you can't knock down with a hammer... ...whispers in your ear, ""Oh, Nancy. "" That was a lot of fun. Thank you for putting me there... ...and giving me the opportunity to get to know myself so much better. And now to return the favor. - This your work? - Yes. I like it. - How do you take your coffee? - Cream and sugar. - I don't have any cream. Sorry. - Just sugar then. - You and John ever come here? - We used to. He's not here now, is he? I had to ask. - I don't have any sugar either. - Thank you. - He hasn't tried to contact you? - No. Did he ever mention the name Leo Crow? No, but I don't talk to John much anymore. - So you haven't seen his apartment. - That was our apartment. Have you been there recently? It's full of these. - How long has he been doping? - Since right after we lost our son. - You mean after he lost your son. - It was nobody's fault. But John was with him at the public pool. You said in your divorce papers that John tried to kill himself. - It wasn't a suicide attempt. - What was it then? The FBI found something that belonged to my son, a sandal. John was upset. He... He took out his gun and watched home movies. - This is all in your statement. - He shot a hole in the ceiling. So what? You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it. Lamar thinks you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you. I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son. Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy. That's why I left him. And now you can leave. Don't take the bandages off for 12 hours. If you take them off before then, you'll go blind. Understand? In the fridge, there's milk. Greta made you a sandwich. Make sure you drink a lot of water. How do I find the bathroom? The bathroom? Now that's your right hand. The kitchen is your left. Don't scratch. Never scratch! Seeing as we're being pals, I'll give you a bonus that may come in handy. This is a temporary paralytic enzyme. You're gonna shoot this under your chin. - What is this? - It'll turn your pretty face into mush. People won't even recognize you. In 30 minutes, it'll tighten up again. But it'll hurt like you've never felt. I'm gonna put this in your goody-bag, together with your... ...leftovers. I'm setting up a timer. When it rings, you can remove the bandages and leave. - But not before then, or you will... - Go blind. I know. Don't scratch. A little something from a mutual friend of ours. Don 't take the bandages off for 12 hours. If you take them off before then, you'll go blind. Understand? - 25. 16 seconds. That's a new record. - Is that a world record? Is it a world record? It's a personal best. - Now I wanna time you. - You gotta be kidding. There's no way I can beat 25. 16 seconds. How long can a whale hold its breath? For about 20 minutes. - So we gotta beat the whale. - Okay. We gotta beat the whale. Here you go. It's gonna be 20 minutes. You sure you don't wanna go for an ice cream? Because you know I'm gonna beat that whale. - Ready? - Give me the count. Three, two, one, go! Sean? Sean? Sean. Have you seen...? I'm looking for my son. Have you seen a boy in a red bathing suit? You seen my boy? He's wearing a red bathing suit. Jad, we're ready to begin thermal scan on all residences on North Powell. You must really like me, don't you? That's why you asked to partner with me on this sortie. You're swell company. It's not that you don't trust me to be alone with the chief, is it? That you think I might, you know, futz with him? No, I just wanna watch him use your body to sandblast another building. Evanna, go. I show 27 warm bodies. Roger that. Confirmed, 27 warm bodies. - Four spyders, one per floor? - Let's do eight. I gotta eat. Residents of 931 Powell, this is Officer Fletcher of D.C. Precrime. Under authority of P.C. section 6409, we are deploying spyders into your complex. Mom, I'm scared. Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy. That's gonna scan you. Keep your eyes open. Stay still. - It's okay. - I don't like it. Stay still. Stay still. Come on! You stepped out on me for the last time. I told you where I was. You're a no-good liar. I know you was with that ho. You're lucky we... Leave me alone! We lost one. Roger that. Maybe it was a cat jumping through a window. It's an awful big cat. Fletcher. I'll go check it out. They're crying their eyes out. You terrified them. Keep your kids away from me. The big cat's back. What do you think? A drunk, maybe can't wake up? Or a guy who doesn't want to get read. Folks, be quiet, go back inside. Be quiet and close the door. We got an ID. It's not him. - Standing down. - Let's eat. Fletcher, take a look. There's four people in this room, not three. Four? There's Anderton, Crow and the man in sunglasses. The man in the sunglasses is outside the window. There's also someone here in the mirror. Definitely female. The Precrime program began in 2046 with a federal grant. And now, nine years later, D.C. is the safest city in America. Why? Because Precrime works. Precrime has eliminated the need for conventional detectives. What happens now is the verification and protection of future victims. Can we see the Pre-Cogs? They have such a powerful gift, they're kept in peaceful seclusion... ...so as not to be distracted. This display should give you some idea of what their daily life is like. The Pre-Cogs get over 8 million letters every year. That's more than Santa Claus gets. Each Pre-Cog has their own bedroom, TV and weight room. It's wonderful to be a Pre-Cog. My mom's new boyfriend came over again last night. He's just not very intelligent. My mom wouldn't let me eat upstairs. I had to listen to him go on and on. Shit! Eye-dent: John Anderton. Approved for entry. - Which I told her I'd be able to do. I'm so good at taking care of you. But she thinks I'll be irresponsible. It's ridiculous because... You can't be in here. What are you doing here? Easy there, old-timer. Who cleared you? - You're not allowed here. - Listen, Wally. - Do I know you? - I like you. So I don't wanna have to kick you or hit you. But only if you promise to help me. Hi, John. Who does that look like to you? I don't know. It's Agatha. He's coming here to get her. - Are these all of her previsions? - I'm rewinding her right now. Just take me to the Leo Crow murder. They don't come out in any order. I'm getting them as she's giving them. Can you see? - He's inside. - He has some kind of mask on. - He sealed the door. - Shit! Nobody fires a weapon inside the temple. Use bindfoam. - Is there another way out of there? - All the doors are covered. John, move away from the tank. Move away from the tank, John. What does he want with a Pre-Cog? So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing. Well, there's still the other two. The other two can still function, right? They're a hive mind. It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work. They can't see murders anymore? Agatha, she's the key. She's the one they listen to... ...the one with the most talent. - She takes care of the other two. - Jesus. - Please bring her back. - Every team underground, now! - It doesn't matter. He wins. - We'll stop him. She's with him when he kills Crow. She's already a part of his future. Jad, put everything you've got into finding that room, and we stop a murder. - How much time have we got, Gordon? - We've got... ...51 minutes, 30 seconds. You cold? Can you understand me? Are you cold? The shivers, it's the drugs we gave you. It should wear off soon. I'm sorry. I need your help. You contain information. I need to know how to get at it. Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is? - Is it now? - What? Is it now? Yes, this is all happening right now. I'm taking you some place in public... ...which means you need something else to wear. I'm tired. I'm tired of the future. Hello, Mr. Yakamoto, welcome back to the Gap. How'd those assorted tank tops work out for you? Mr. Yakamoto? Miss Belfor, did you come back for another pair of those chammy lace-ups? - If it's ransom, where's the damn note? - It has nothing to do with ransom. It has to do with the information inside of Agatha. - He's trying to prove his innocence. - He can't download her without support. Your average consumer can't buy any of this stuff. It's been assembled and scrounged from spare parts made to order. Assuming Anderton ordered this, who put it together? Who's Rufus T. Riley? What's your pleasure? We got it all here: Sports fantasies... ...""Look, Ma, I can fly"" fantasies... ...which covers everything from bungee jumping to flying over the Grand Canyon. You can experience sex as a woman. Women come in to get laid by their favorite soap star. Or just some good, clean fun. It's a big rush, but you come out without a heart attack. I wanna kill my boss. Okay. - You got some images I can work with? - Rufus. Yeah, being concertmaster for the Philadelphia Symphony... ...is a popular choice. - I wanna kill my boss. - You sick bastard. You make this a terrible world to live in! Detective, nice of you to come here, seeing how every cop is looking for you. - I need your help. - Why'd you come here? - I make house calls. - I need your help with her. Hello, honey pie. I'm impressed. You're on the lam... ...and you still have the time to slice off a little... jerky for yourself. - She's a Pre-Cog. - Oh, yeah, okay. - That's right. - She's a Pre-Cog. You brought a Pre-Cog here. Jesus Christ. - Are you reading my mind right now? - Get up. I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do. I swear I didn't do that stuff I did. She has information inside her. I need you to get it out. No way. I wouldn't even know where to begin. Those thoughts about my cousin were just thoughts. - You've been busted for felony hacking. - So? So I need you to hack into her. I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head. - They don't belong to anybody. - Take her to RadioShack. You're gonna help me. Agatha, I need to see. I need to see what's gonna happen to me. And then we'll go. - She works. - Slow it down. How do I slow this down? I should hit her on the head? - Are you recording this? - Shit. Yeah, recording. I know this already. Come on. Move on. Goodbye, Crow. Goodbye, Crow. - What happened? - I don't know. - What happened? - I don't... - Where's the rest of it? - I guess that's all of it. Where's my Minority Report? Do I even have one? - Do I have one? - No. - What? - No. What? Agatha? What? What? - Can you see? - See what? Anne Lively. You want me to see who killed Anne Lively. Are you recording this? Yeah, but it's pouring out of her backwards. I like my life. Everything's good. They're inside. Who? All your old teammates. Kenny, left chamber. Alan, straight across. Negative! - Negative! - Negative! I don't deserve that. - You are the man. - No, you're the man. Can you see the umbrella? Take it. Take it! A man in a blue suit. He drops his briefcase. You see a woman in a brown dress. She knows your face. Turn in here. Let's go. - Wait. - No, we can't stop here. Can you see the balloon man? Wait. - Wait. - What are we waiting for? Wait. Wait. Wait. - Please, Mommy, can I have one? - All right. Wait. Thank you. - Anybody got an ID? Anybody? - Negative. Scott, Ramos, take the east end. Everyone else, follow me. Let's go. He knows. Don't go home. We've got eyes on. They're working, but they're standing on it. Please! Please! Have you got a quarter? Drop some money. Can't you put it in my hand? May the Lord bless you. May God take care of you. Damn! That's the guy. The man in the window. - Rooms are 95 a night. - Mind if I look at the registry? I mind. How about now? Help yourself. He's here. Anderton, leave. You have a choice. Walk away. Do it now. I can't. I have to find out what happened in my life. Please. Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man. I don't even know him. - What room is Crow in? Come on. Come on. Wrong room. Leave. Leave. Oh, God. This is Sean. My son. Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things: The first is what my son would look like if he were alive today... ...if I would recognize him if I saw him on the street. And the second is what I would do to the man who took him. You're right. I'm not being set up. You have to take me home. You said so yourself. There is no Minority Report. I don't have an alternate future. I am going to kill this man. You still have a choice. The others never saw their future. You still have a choice. - Leo Crow? - Who the hell are you? Six years ago, Baltimore... ...you grabbed a kid at Francis public pool on the West End. Did I? I don't remember anything about that place. Who am I? Who am I? Do you know who I am? - You're somebody's father. - His name is Sean! Sean! I told him I was a policeman and needed his help. It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song. I bought him a pretzel. He was happy. He was happy. Is he alive? He's alive. Where have you got him? Is he all right? Tell me, you fuck, where is he?! I put him in a barrel. I sunk him in the bay. He floated back up. I took him out. I was gentle. I was gentle. I was gentle. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry. How could you do that to my...? You can choose. You can choose. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney... ...now and during any further questioning. If you can't afford an attorney... ...we will appoint one. Do you understand these rights? You're not gonna kill me? - Do you understand these rights? - You're not gonna kill me? If you don't go through with this, my family gets nothing. You're supposed to kill me. He said you would. He? Who's he? I don't know. He called me in my cell. He told me I'd be released if I went along, and my family would be cared for. If you did what? If you did what? If I acted like I killed your kid. Okay? If you killed my kid? Look, you don't kill me, my family gets nothing. Okay? What about the pictures? They're fake. He gave them to me. Now, listen to me. You... You tell me: Who was it that set this up? I don't know. - Come on. - I'm asking you again: - Who put you up to this? - I didn't see his face. I tell you who, and my family gets nothing. - Who made you do this? - Kill me. - You can do this. Kill me. - Tell me. - Kill me. - Leo, let go of the gun. Let go of the gun. It's okay. Let go of the gun. That's it. Let go of the gun. You're not gonna kill me. - Goodbye, Crow. - Anderton, wait a sec...! - Did you see it? - Stay back! What's happening down there? Murder! Murder! Doesn't make sense. If you were a child killer, would you leave these photos out? Anderton might have found them. - What kind of cop were you before this? - Treasury agent. This will be your first murder scene? I worked homicide before federal. This is an orgy of evidence. - Know how many orgies I had as a cop? - How many? None. This was all arranged. Today we saw the first murder in the six years of the Precrime experiment. Sadly enough, this failure was human. The protection team simply didn't get there in time. But the murder itself happened exactly as the Pre-Cogs predicted it would. Today's event put a human face on the Precrime system. Danny Witwer's on the phone. He says it's important. Lamar? - What? - There's something wrong. We're chasing the wrong man. I don 't wanna say over the phone. Meet me at Anderton 's. We recovered that from Leo Crow's hotel room. I remember when I gave this to him, back in Baltimore. Please, sir. Tell me what you have. This is the murder of a woman named Anne Lively. John told me about this. You got this from Containment? Yes. This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiell. Agatha's stream was missing. This one is from the Cyber Parlor. Anderton downloaded this directly from Agatha. Rufus Riley recorded it. - It's the same prevision. - Not quite. Look at the surface wind across the water. Watch the ripples. Moving away from shore. Now the second image, the one from Containment that Art and Dash saw. Watch the water. The wind's changed. The ripples are moving the other way. This murder's taking place at two different times. Anderton was watching this right before he was tagged. He told me about the missing data stream. - He was concerned you might find it. - He was right. I did. It was inside of Agatha. So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file? Danny, just tell me what you're thinking. I'm thinking someone got away with murder. How? Jad told me that sometimes the Pre-Cogs see the same murder more than once. - It's called an echo. - Jad called it Pre-Cog deja vu. We teach the techs to identify and disregard them. Yeah, but what if a technician only thought he was looking at an echo? What if he was looking at a completely different murder altogether? I don't understand. All you'd have to do is hire someone to kill Anne Lively... ...like a drifter, a neuroin addict, someone with nothing to lose. Precrime stops the murder from taking place... ...haloes the killer, takes him away. But then, right then, someone else... ...having reviewed the prevision and dressed in the same clothes... ...commits the murder in exactly the same way. Technician takes a look, thinks he's looking at an echo, erases it. It'd have to be someone with access to the previsions in the first place. Someone fairly high-up. Do you know what I hear? Nothing. No footsteps up the stairs. No hovercraft out the window. No clickety-click of little spyders. Do you know why? Because right now, the Pre-Cogs can't see a thing. Can you see? It's beautiful. - Where are we going? - Someplace safe. - Burgess. - Lamar, it's Lara. - Yes, Lara. - You have to help him. Is he there? Is the Pre-Cog with him? Keep them there. I'm on my way. Please don't tell Danny Witwer. I don't trust him. I won't say a word. You just don't let John leave, all right? He's no killer, Lamar. I know. It's cold. Lara, this is Agatha. You remember when I would read Tom Sawyer to you and Sean? He got so scared when Tom and Becky were lost in the cave. I gotta sit down. I gotta figure this out. I gotta figure this out. They used Sean. They wanted me to think Crow killed him. But he didn't. He didn't. Why would they set you up? Because I found out about her. About who? - How could I not have seen this? - Seen what? Anne Lively. Agatha. Dr. Hineman once said, ""The dead don't die... ...they look on and help. "" Remember that, John. Agatha. Sean. He's on the beach now... ...toe in the water. He's asking you to come in with him. He's been racing his mother up and down the sand. There's so much love in this house. He's 10 years old. He's surrounded by animals. He wants to be a vet. You keep a rabbit for him, a bird and a fox. He's in high school. He likes to run, like his father. He runs the two-mile and the long relay. He's 23. He's at a university. He makes love to a pretty girl named Claire. He asks her to be his wife. He calls here and tells Lara, who cries. He still runs... ...across the university and in the stadium, where John watches. Oh, God. He's running so fast, just like his daddy. He sees his daddy. He wants to run to him. But he's only 6 years old, and he can't do it. And the other man is so fast. There was so much love in this house. I want him back so bad. So did she. Can't you see? She just wanted her little girl back. But it was too late. Her little girl was already gone. She's still alive. She didn't die. But she's not alive. Agatha? Just tell me... ...who killed your mother? Who killed Anne Lively? I'm sorry, John, but you're gonna have to run again. - What? - Run! I love you. - It's okay. - You'll be fine with them. - No! No! - Stay with me. Stay with me. - John, no. - Don't talk. John Anderton. By mandate of the D.C. Precrime Division... ...I'm placing you under arrest for the murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer. That's it. That's my girl. I was so worried about you. Did he hurt you? I missed you so much. It's okay. Wally's here. Wally's here. You're a part of my flock now, John. Welcome. It's actually kind of a rush. They say you have visions... ...that your life flashes before your eyes... ...that all your dreams come true. This is all my fault. There was nothing anyone could do. I thought you might want to have those. I haven't worn this in years. I wanted to make sure it fits before tonight. You look great. I knew he was having trouble for some time, yet I did nothing. - The guy from USA Today is here. - Tell him not now. - He just wanted a few minutes before... - Not now! - I thought you were retiring. - Well, I was. But this incident with John made me realize the fragility of all this. This is John's legacy as much as it is my own. Now I have an obligation to protect that. Lara, I know how difficult this is for you. But maybe you can find some closure in the fact... ...that John finally found the man who killed your son. Who's Anne Lively? - Who? - Anne Lively. John was talking about her right before they took him. I don't know who that is. John said something about him being set up because he found out about her. - Well, we know why John was tagged. - He also said Crow was a fake. And Witwer? He was killed with John's gun inside John's apartment. Do you know the reason why John came here to work for you? - Sean. - Yes. He came here to work for you because he thought... ...if he could just stop that kind of thing from happening... - I understand. - No, I don't think you do. Sir, they wanna start the press conference in two minutes. Lara... ...John was the best cop I ever knew... ...and, in some ways, also the best man. But the scars he carried around... Well, I know he'd want us to honor the good things we remember about him. And I also know why he married you: You're as stubborn as he is. - Lamar... - Do you know how to tie one of these? Could you please give me a hand? I'm all thumbs, as you see. Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence. And I'll have Gideon run the Containment files... ...see if anyone drowned a woman by the name of... What did you say her name was? Anne Lively. But I never said she drowned. - Sir, the press conference is starting. - I'll be right there. We'll talk about this later. Perhaps tomorrow, I'll come by the cottage. I'd like a word with my husband. You're not authorized. How did you get in here? Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess, director of the new National Precrime. On behalf of your staff, we present you with this. - Congratulations, sir. - My God. How did you get this? I padded your expense account for six months. Revolvers like this one were given to generals... ...at the end of the Civil War by their troops. The cylinders were loaded with five gold-plated bullets... ...to symbolize the end of the destruction and death... ...that had ripped the country apart for five years. Ladies and gentlemen, with Precrime going national... ...maybe we can all look forward to a time when none of us... ...will have to discharge another firearm ever again. Now enjoy yourselves. Enjoy yourselves! That's an order. Does this mean we can finally use the lake house on weekends? Hello. Yes. Right away. - Excuse me, so sorry. - Excuse me. - Sir? - Yes. Sir, you have an emergency call on your private line. Yes, this is Burgess. Hello, Lamar. I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it. You created a world without murder. Everyone wants your name on a hat. Can you sign these? All you had to do was kill someone to do it. A-room. Jad. Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor. - What are you talking about? - Agatha 's mother, Anne Lively. Just a junkie who had a kid once and had to give her up, but surprise! She cleaned herself up, and she wanted her daughter back. She wanted Agatha. Jad, you getting this? It's from the female only. No time or incident data. It isn't the future. It already happened. And the problem was, without Agatha, there was no Precrime. She's the strongest of the three. Without Agatha, you had nothing. You wouldn't be where you are now, standing there, signing autographs. - What are you doing? - What are you doing with that? - What you up to, big man? - Think before you send that. Slow down. Now you had to get rid of Anne Lively, which presented a problem: How can you kill her without the Pre-Cogs seeing it? Simple. Use a system you control against her. You hired someone to kill her, knowing the Pre-Cogs would see that murder. You lured Anne Lively out to the lake... ...with the promise of reuniting her with her daughter. Where's my daughter? Where? Run! Run! When you were all alone, you killed her yourself... ...in the same way the Pre-Cogs predicted your John Doe would kill her. You made the real murder look like an echo... ...knowing the tech would do what he was trained to do: Disregard it. Anne Lively became just another missing person. So, what are you gonna do, Lamar? What are you gonna do? We got a Red Ball! Think about the lives that little girl has saved. Think about the lives that little girl has saved. Think of all the lives she will save. She could have saved Sean. Don't you ever say his name! You used the memory of my dead son to set me up. You used the memory of my dead son to set me up. You knew that would drive me to murder. - What are you gonna do now, Lamar? - What are you gonna do now, Lamar? - How are you gonna...? - Shut me up? Forgive me, John. Forgive me, John. Lamar. It's over. The question you have to ask is, what are you gonna do now? No doubt the Pre-Cogs have already seen this. No doubt. You see the dilemma, don't you? If you don't kill me, Pre-Cogs were wrong and Precrime is over. If you do kill me, you go away... ...but it proves the system works. Pre-Cogs were right. So, what are you gonna do now? What's it worth? Just one more murder. You'll rot in hell with a halo, but people will still believe in Precrime. All you have to do is kill me, like they said you would. Except... ...you know your own future... ...which means you can change it if you want to. You still have a choice, Lamar. Like I did. Yes, I have a choice... ...and I made it. Forgive me, John. Forgive me. Forgive me, my boy. Lamar! In 2054, the six-year Precrime experiment was abandoned. All prisoners were unconditionally pardoned and released... ...although police departments kept watch on many of them for years. Agatha and the twins... ...were transferred to an undisclosed location... ...a place where they could find relief from their gifts... ...a place where they could live out their lives in peace., Who am I? You sure you want to know? The story of my life is not for the faint of heart. If somebody said it was a happy little tale... ...if somebody told you I was just an average guy, not a care in the world... ...somebody lied. But let me assure you, this, like any story worth telling... ...is all about a girl. That girl. The girl next door. Mary Jane Watson. The woman I've loved since before I liked girls. I'd like to tell you that's me next to her. Aw, heck, I'd even take him. Hey! Stop the bus! That's me. Tell him to stop! Please! Stop! Hey! Stop the bus! Stop! He's been chasing us since Woodhaven. Catch a cab, Parker! Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late. What a geek! - Don't even think about it. - You're so lame, Parker. Would you date him? Midtown High seniors. No wandering. Proceed direct... Knock it off. Remember, it is a privilege to be here. We're guests of Columbia University's Science Department. So behave accordingly. Let's not have a repeat of our trip to the planetarium. Come on, stay together. Proceed up the steps and into the building. - Where were you? - Checking out the library. - Looking at the books. - Yeah, right. - Can we drive around the corner? - Why? The entrance is right there. Dad, this is public school. I can't show up in a Rolls. I should trade my car for a Jetta... ...because you flunked out of private school? - It wasn't for me. - Of course it was. - Don't ever be ashamed of who you are. - I'm not ashamed of who I am. It's just... Just what, Harry? Forget it. Pete! - Hi, Harry. - Hey, man. What's up? - Won't you be needing this? - Thanks. - This is my father, Norman Osborn. - I've heard so much about you. - It's an honor, sir. - Harry says you're a science whiz. I'm something of a scientist myself. I read your research on nanotechnology. Brilliant. - You understood it? - Yes, I wrote a paper on it. Impressive. Your parents must be very proud. - I live with my aunt and uncle. - Hey, you two! Let's move! - Nice to meet you. - Hope to see you again. - He doesn't seem so bad. - Not if you're a genius. I think he wants to adopt you. There are over 32,000 known species of spider in the world. They're in the order Araneae, divided into three suborders. That's amazing! This is the most advanced electron microscope on the East Coast. It's unreal. Arachnids from all three groups possess... ...varying strengths to help them search for food. For example, the Delena spider, family Sparassidae... ...has the ability to jump to catch its prey. For the school paper? Next, we have the net web spider, family Filistatidae... ...genus Kukulcania. Spins a funnel-shaped web whose strands have a tensile strength... ...proportionately equal to the high-tension wires used in bridges. - Leave him alone. - Or what? Or his father will fire your father. What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me? What is going on? The next person who talks will fail this course. - This spider... - Let's go. ...hunts using reflexes with nerve-conduction velocity so fast... ...that some researchers believe it borders on precognition. - An early awareness of danger. - Jerks. A spider-sense. Hey, look at that spider. Some spiders change colors to blend into their environment. It's a defense mechanism. Peter, what makes you think I'd want to know that? Who wouldn't? Over five painstaking years, Columbia's research facility... - You gonna talk to her now? - Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her. With these DNA blueprints, we have begun what was once thought impossible. - Disgusting. - Yeah, hateful little things. I love them! Yeah, me too. You know, spiders can change their color... ...to blend into their environment. - Really? - Yeah, it's a defense mechanism. - Cool. - transfer RNA to encode an entirely new genome... ...combining the genetic information from all three... ...into these 15 genetically designed super-spiders. There's 14. I beg your pardon? - One's missing. - Yeah. I guess the researchers are working on that one. Do you know that this is the largest electron microscope on the East Coast? You were talking throughout that woman's entire presentation. Let's talk about listening. I don't know what it's like at those fancy private schools... ...but at Midtown High... Could I take your picture? I need one with a student in it. - Sure. - Great. Where do you want me? Over here? Yeah, that's great. Don't make me look ugly. That's impossible. Perfect. - Is that good? - Great. That's great. M.J., let's go! Wait. Thanks! Parker, let's do it. We've solved the horizon glide and the balance issues. I've already seen the glider. That's not what I'm here for. General Slocum, good to see you again. Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas. - Norman. - Mr. Osborn. Always a pleasure to have our board of directors visit. I want the report on human performance enhancers. We tried vapor inhalation with rats. Their strength increased by 800%. - Excellent. - Any side effects? Once. All the tests since have been successful. In the trial that went wrong, what were the side effects? Violence, aggression... ...and insanity. - What do you recommend? - That was only one test. Except for Dr. Stromm, our staff certifies the product... ...ready for human testing. - Dr. Stromm? We need to take the whole line back to formula. - Back to formula? - Dr. Osborn. I'll be frank with you. I never supported your program. We have my predecessor to thank for that. The general has approved Quest Aerospace... ...to build a prototype of their exoskeleton. - They test in two weeks. - And if your performance enhancers... ...have not had a successful human trial by that date... ...I'm gonna pull your funding. I'm going to give it to them. Gentlemen. Ladies. And the Lord said, ""Let there be light."" And voil! There is light. Forty soft, glowing watts of it. Good boy. God will be thrilled. Just don't fall on your ass. I'm already on my ass, May. When the plant's senior electrician is laid off after 35 years... ...what would you call it? I am on my ass. Hand me that dish. The green one. The corporation is downsizing the people... ...and upsizing their profits. Oh, Ben, you'll get another job somewhere. Well, let's look in the paper and see. There are the want ads. What do we got here? Computer... Computer salesman, computer engineer, computer analyst. My Lord, even the computers need analysts these days. I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and besides, I have a family to provide for. I love you. And Peter loves you. You're the most responsible man I've ever known. We've been down-and-out before. But somehow, we survive. Hi, sweetie. You're just... Just in time for dinner. How you doing? How was the field trip? I don't feel well. I'm gonna go to sleep. - You won't have a bite? - Had a bite. Did you get some pictures, Peter? I gotta crash. Everything's fine. What's that all about? In this recombination lab... ...we use synthesized transfer RNA to encode an entirely new genome... ...combining the genetic information from all three... ...into these 15 genetically designed super-spiders. Dr. Osborn, please. The performance enhancers aren't ready. The data just doesn't justify this test. Now, I'm asking you for the last time. We can't do this. Don't be a coward. Risks are part of laboratory science. Let me reschedule, with a medical staff and a volunteer. - Just give me two weeks. - Two weeks? In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract to Quest and OSCORP will be dead. Sometimes you gotta do things yourself. - Get me the Promachloraperazine. - For what? It begins catalyzation when the vapor hits the bloodstream. 40,000 years of evolution... ...and we've barely tapped the vastness of human potential. Oh, that's cold. Norman? Norman! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Norman! Back to formula? Weird. - Peter? - Yeah? Are you all right? I'm fine. - Any better this morning? Any change? - Change? Yep. Big change. - Well, hurry up. You'll be late. - Right. Okay. - Goodness me! - Jeez. I thought you were sick. - I got better. - See? - Bye, guys. - Have you got your lunch money? Don't forget, we're painting the kitchen after school. Sure, Uncle Ben. Don't start without me. And don't start up with me. Teenagers. Raging hormones. They never change. You're trash! You're always gonna be trash! - I have to go to school. - Who's stopping you? Hi, M.J. Hey, M.J. I don't know if you realize this, but we've been neighbors since I was 6. And I was wondering if we could get together sometime? I got the car. Hop in. Do something fun? Or, I don't know. I thought it'd be time to get to know each other. Or not. Sorry, Parker, the bus is full! - Stop the bus! - Catch a cab! Tell him to stop. - Check him out! - Dork! Dad! Dad, are you all right? Harry. What are you doing on the floor? I don't know. Have you been there all night? Last night I was... What? - I don't remember. - Mr. Osborn? Sir, I asked her to wait. - My father's not feeling well... - Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead. What? They found his body in the lab. He's been murdered, sir. - What? - And the flight suit and the glider... - What about it? - Stolen, sir. Wow! Great reflexes! - Thanks. - No problem. Hey, you have blue eyes. I didn't notice without your glasses. You just get contacts? Well, see you. - What happened? - He's freaking weird. Did you see that? Parker? - It's a fight! - Think you're funny? - It was an accident. - So is my breaking your teeth. - Flash, stop. - I don't want to fight you. - I wouldn't want to fight me neither. - Kick his ass. Help him, Harry. How'd he do that? Which one? He's all yours, man. Flash, get up! Jesus, Parker, you are a freak. That was amazing. I'm out of here. Come on. Go, web! Fly. Up, up and away, web. Shazam! Go! Go! Go, web, go! Tallyho. - Is she back with the beer yet? - What? Bring me some beer. - Get up off your ass. - I paid for beer... - Stop yelling. - Stop it! You're as stupid as your mother. Where's she going? Where you going? The dishes aren't done. Somebody's gotta do dishes. - Why don't you do them? - Get in here and do the dishes. - You do them. They're yours, anyway. - I'm going out! - Were you listening to that? - No. Well, I heard, but I was just taking out the trash. I guess you can always hear us. Everybody shouts. Your aunt and uncle don't. Oh, they can scream pretty good sometimes. Listen, M.J., about today at school with Flash... You really freaked us out. I'm sorry. Is he okay? He's just happy you didn't give him a black eye for graduation. So where are you going after you graduate? I wanna move into the city. And hopefully, get a job as a photographer. Work my way through college. What about you? Headed for the city too. Can't wait to get out of here. I wanna... What? No, come on. Try me. I wanna... ...act... ...on-stage. Really? Oh, that's perfect. You were awesome in all the school plays. - Really? - Yeah. I cried like a baby when you played Cinderella. Peter, that was first grade. Well... ...even so. Sometimes... ...you know people. You can just see what's coming. What do you see coming for you? I don't know. Whatever it is, it's something I never felt before. And what for me? For you? You're gonna light up Broadway. You know... ...you're taller than you look. I hunch. Don't. Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride in my new birthday present. Come on. I gotta go. Bye. - Oh, my God, it's gorgeous! - Yeah, right. - Look at it! - Hop in. Oh, my God. What a cool car! Pretty tight, huh? Wait till you hear the sound system. Hey, don't scratch the leather. Cool car. What's going on in there? I'm exercising. I'm not dressed, Aunt May. Well, you're acting so strangely, Peter. Okay. Thanks. Something's wrong. Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me. Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him. I just don't know anymore. I'm going to the library. See you later. - Wait. I'll drive you there. - I'll take the train. No, I need the exercise. Go on. Go, go. - Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben. - Wait. We need to talk. - We can talk later. - Well, we can talk now. If you let me. What do we have to talk about? Why now? We haven't talked for so long. May and I don't know who you are. You shirk your chores. You have all those weird experiments in your room. - You start fights at school. - I told you I didn't start that fight. - You sure finished it. - Was I supposed to run away? No, you're not supposed to run away, but... You're changing. I went through exactly the same thing at your age. No. Not exactly. These are the years when a man changes... ...into the man he's gonna become the rest of his life. Just be careful who you change into. This guy, Flash Thompson, he probably deserved what happened. But just because you can beat him up... ...doesn't give you the right to. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Are you afraid I'll become a criminal? Quit worrying about me, okay? Something's different. I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing. I don't mean to lecture or preach. And I know I'm not your father. Then stop pretending to be! Right. I'll pick you up here at 10. Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw! - One, two, three. That's it! - Who's the man? Ladies and gentlemen... ...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw. For $3000... ...is there no one here man enough to stay in the ring... ...for three minutes with this titan of testosterone? Who? I know who. The Flying Dutchman! Next. There's no featherweight division here. Next. No, no. Sign me up. Okay. You understand the NYWL is not responsible... ...for any injury you may and probably will sustain in said event? And you're participating under your own free will? Down the hall to the ramp. May God be with you. Next. Told you! Told you! Winner! Next victim! Are you ready for more? Bone Saw is ready! Will the next victim please enter the arena at this time? If he can withstand just three minutes in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw... ...the sum of $3000 will be paid to... - What's your name, kid? - The Human Spider. That's it? That's the best you got? - Yeah. - Oh, that sucks. The sum of $3000 will be paid to... ...the terrifying, the deadly... ...the amazing Spider-Man! - It's ""The Human Spider."" - Get out there. - No, he got my name wrong. - Get out there, moron. Bone Saw will eat you up and spit you out. I hope you brought your mommy. - We'll break you! - You'll need someone to cry to. I'm gonna rip all eight of your feeble legs off one by one. Oh, my God! Oh, my legs! Oh, God. I can't feel my legs. Kill! Kill! Kill! Cage! Cage! Cage! Cage! Hello? Guys? Will the guards please lock the cage doors at this time? This is some kind of mistake. I didn't sign up for a cage match! Unlock the thing! Take the chain off! Hey, freak show! You're going nowhere. I got you for three minutes. Three minutes of playtime. - What are you doing up there? - Staying away from you. That's a cute outfit. Did your husband give it to you? Finish him off! Smash him! - Hit him! - Harder! Kick his spider ass! Hit him! One, two, three! That's it! That's it! Winner! Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for the new champion, Spider-Man! Now get out of here. A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000. Well, check it again, webhead. It said three grand for three minutes. You pinned him in two. For that, I give you 100. You're lucky to get that. I need that money. I missed the part where that's my problem. - Hey, what the hell..? - Put the money in the bag. Hurry up! Hey! He stole the gate! Stop that guy! Stop him! He's got my money! Thanks. What's wrong with you? You let him go! Cut him off and call the cops! You could've taken that guy apart. Now he'll get away. I missed the part where that's my problem. - You gotta get back. - I can't see. What happened? Old dude, man. Come on, folks. Keep moving, please. Keep moving. Let's go! - What happened? - Someone got hurt. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Stay back. - Stay back! - That's my uncle! - What happened? - Carjacker. He's been shot. We just called the paramedics. They're on their way. Uncle Ben? Uncle Ben. Uncle Ben? Peter. I'm here, Uncle Ben. Peter. They got the shooter. He's headed south on Fifth. We got three cars in pursuit. All right, folks. Come on, move back. Get a unit to the rear! I got the back! Who's there? Don't hurt me. Give me a chance. Give me a chance! What about my uncle? Did you give him a chance? Did you? Answer me! Stop that guy! Thanks. See you. Freeze! We've got the place completely surrounded. Oh, no. My God. Oh, no. Oh, my God. No! - Good evening. - General. Good to see you. Our exoskeleton's got real firepower, general. Well, if it does what you say it can, I'll sign that contract tomorrow. - He's clear! Go! - You're confident about this test? Absolutely. Curtis is our top pilot. Now, what about your commitment to OSCORP? Nothing would please me more than to put Osborn out of business. Preflight complete. Mark. An unidentified object is closing fast. What's that? Can you see anything? Oh, my God! - Say ""chess."" - Chess! Peter! Darling, I'm so proud of you. You looked so handsome up there. Dad got the place in New York, so we're all set for fall. - Great! - You made it. It's not the first time I've been proven wrong. - Congratulations. - Thanks, Dad. Peter, the science award. That's terrific. Yeah. I know this has been a difficult time for you... ...but I want you to try to enjoy this day. Commencement: The end of one thing, the start of something new. I don't want to be with you anymore. Here's your ring. You know what? Whatever. Your loss. You're like a brother to Harry. That makes you family. And if you ever need anything, give me a call. Can I fix you something? No, thanks. I missed him a lot today. I know. I miss him too. But he was there. I can't help thinking about the last thing I said to him. He tried to tell me something important, and I threw it in his face. You loved him... ...and he loved you. He never doubted the man you'd grow into. How you were meant for great things. You won't disappoint him. With great power comes great responsibility. Remember that, Pete. Remember that. Hurry up! He's not a man. My brother saw him build a nest in Lincoln Center. I think he's human, a man. Could be a woman. Bobby. Get a load of this! He throws up his hands, ropes come out, and he climbs up them. I see the web, his signature, and I know Spider-Man was here. The guy protects us, protects the people. Some kind of freakyloo or something. He stinks and I don't like him. Don't move, lady! Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot. Those tights and that tight little... Dresses like a spider He looks like a bug But we should all just give him One big hug Look out Here comes the Spider-Man ""Who is Spider-Man?"" He's a criminal, that's who he is. A vigilante, a public menace. Why's he on my front page? Mr. Jameson, your wife needs... - There's a page six problem. - We have a page one problem. - Well? - He's news. - The clients can't wait. - They're about to. - He pulled six people off a subway. - From a wreck he probably caused. Something goes wrong and he's there. Look! He's fleeing the scene. He's probably going to save somebody else. He's a hero! Then why the mask? What's he got to hide? She needs to know if you want chintz or chenille. - Whichever's cheaper. - It's like this: We double-booked page six. Macy's and Conway's both have... - We sold out four printings. - Sold out? Every copy. Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one. Move Conway to page seven. - That's a problem. - Then make it page eight. - That can't be done. - Get out! We can't get a decent picture. Eddie's on it, but we can barely see him. Aw, what is he, shy? If we can get Julia Roberts in a thong, we can get this weirdo. On the front page: ""Cash for a Spider-Man picture."" He doesn't want to be famous? I'll make him infamous! Buzz off. - M.J., it's me, Peter. - Hi! - What are you doing around here? - Begging for a job. How about you? - I'm headed to an audition. - An audition? So you're acting? Yeah. I work steady. In fact, I just got off a job. That's great. - You're doing it. Living your dream. - Glamour girl! Your drawer was short $6! Next time, I'll take it from your check. Excuse me, Miss Watson? I'm talking to you! Hey! Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you. It better not happen no more. Don't roll your eyes at me. Some dream, huh? It's nothing to be embarrassed about. - Don't tell Harry. - Don't tell Harry? Don't you guys live together? We're going out. Didn't he tell you? Oh, yeah. Right. I think he'd hate the idea of my waiting tables. - He'd think it was low or something. - It's not low. You have a job. You know, Harry doesn't live on a little place I like to call Earth. No, I guess not. Thanks, Pete. We should catch up sometime. Let's get some lunch some evening. I'll come by and have some of your Moondance coffee some day. - And I won't tell Harry. - Don't tell Harry. I won't. I won't tell Harry. Timing's perfect. Hey. Five new contracts. It'll be great. Norman's making his weekly inspection. Spent half of it on the phone. Look, man, I'm glad you're here. I need your help. I'm really lost here. Are you all right? You look like you just got second place in the science fair. I was late for work and Dr. Connors fired me. You were late again? I don't get it. Where do you go all the time? Around. Peter Parker. - Maybe you'll tell me who she is. - Who? - This mystery girl Harry's been dating. - Dad. When do I get to meet her? Well, sorry. Harry hasn't mentioned her. Pete, you're probably looking for a job now, right? Dad, maybe you can help him out. - I appreciate it, but I'll be fine. - I'll make a few calls. I couldn't accept it. I like to earn what I get. I'll find work. I respect that. You want to make it on your own. That's great. What other skills do you have? I was thinking about photography. Hello. Let's go! Move it! Watch the street! Cheese! They're crap. Crap, crap. Megacrap. - I'll give you $200. - That seems a little low. Take them somewhere else. - Your wife says the tile's out of stock. - We'll put a rug there. Sit down. Give me that. Give you 300. That's the standard fee. - Scrap page one. Run that. - Headline? ""Spider-Man, Hero or Menace? Exclusive Photos."" - Menace? He was protecting... - You take the photos... ...I'll make up the headlines. Okay? - Yes, sir. - Goody. Give this to the girl up front. She'll see you get paid. - I'd like a job, sir. - No jobs. Freelance. Best thing for you. You bring me more shots of that clown, maybe I'll buy them. But I never said you have a job. Meat. I'll send you a box of Christmas meat. Bring me more photos. - Hi. - Hi. Mr. Jameson told me to give that to you. - Welcome to the Daily Bugle. - Thank you. I'm Peter Parker. I'm a photographer. Yes. I can see that. As of today... ...OSCORP Industries has surpassed Quest Aerospace... ...as the principal supplier to the United States military. In short, ladies and gentlemen of the board... ...costs are down, revenues are up... ...and our stock has never been higher. Wonderful news, Norman. That's why we're selling the company. What? Quest is recapitalizing in the wake of the bombing. Expanding. They made a tender offer we can't ignore. Why wasn't I told? They don't want a power struggle with entrenched management. The deal is off if you come with it. The board expects your resignation in 30 days. You can't do this to me. I started this company. You know how much I sacrificed?! - Oh, Max. Please. - Norman, the board is unanimous. We're announcing the sale after the World Unity Festival. I'm sorry. You're out, Norman. Am I? Let's hear it for Macy Gray. M.J., why didn't you wear the black dress? Just, I wanted to impress my father. He loves black. Well, maybe he'll be impressed no matter what. You think I'm pretty. I think you're beautiful. I forgot my drink inside. - Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas. - Oh, Harry. - Have you seen my father? - Well, I'm not sure if he's coming. - What is that? - Must be new this year. What is that? That's our glider! What the hell was that? Code three! - Oh, my God! Harry! - M.J.! Harry! Help me! Harry! Out, am I? - Mary Jane! - Harry! Hello, my dear. It's Spider-Man! - Come on. Move, kid. - Billy! Somebody help him! No! Mommy! - Hold it! - I surrender. - Oh, boy. - Hold it right there! Impressive. - Mary Jane! - Help! Someone please help me! Hold on! Watch out! We'll meet again, Spider-Man! Well, beats taking the subway. Don't mind us. She just needs to use the elevator. Wait. Who are you? - You know who I am. - I do? Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Incredible? What do you mean he's incredible? No. All right, wait. Stay there. I'll come over. No, I'm gonna come... All right. Fine. Will you call me in the morning? And we'll go and have breakfast and... ...I want to buy you something. Because I want to. It'll make you feel better. Okay. And what do you mean, incredible? All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs... She's all right. She's just a little rattled. Look, Pete, I should have told you about us. But you should know I'm crazy about her. It's just, you know, you never made a move. You're right. I didn't. I'm gonna get some rest. I'm gonna stay up for a while. What was that thing? I don't know. Whatever it is, somebody has to stop it. Somebody there? Somebody. Who said that? Don't play the innocent with me. You've known all along. Where are you? Follow the cold shiver running down your spine. I'm right here. I don't understand. Did you think it was coincidence? So many good things, all happening for you. All for you. Norman. What do you want? To say what you won't. To do what you can't. To remove those in your way. The board members. You killed them. We killed them. We? Remember? Your little accident in the laboratory. The performance enhancers. Bingo. Me! Your greatest creation. Bringing you what you've always wanted: Power beyond your wildest dreams. And it's only the beginning. There's only one who can stop us. Or imagine if he joined us. Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin. The Green Goblin. You like that? Made it up myself. - These weirdos all got to have a name. - Mr. Jameson... - Hoffman! - Yeah? Copyright ""Green Goblin."" I want a quarter every time it's said. How about ""Green Meanie""? Spider-Man wasn't attacking. That's slander. It is not. I resent that. Slander is spoken. In print, it's libel. You don't trust anybody. I trust my barber. Are you his lawyer? Let him sue. Get rich like a normal person. That's what made this country... Jameson, you slime. Who takes the pictures of Spider-Man? - I don't know. His stuff comes by mail. - Liar! - I swear. - He's the one who can bring me to him. - I don't know who he is. - You are useless. Set him down, tough guy. - Speak of the devil. - I knew you two were in this together! Kiddo, let Mom and Dad talk for a minute. Sleep... Wake up, little spider. Wake up. No, you're not dead yet. Just paralyzed... ...temporarily. You're an amazing creature, Spider-Man. You and I are not so different. I'm not like you. You're a murderer. Well, to each his own. I chose my path, you chose the way of the hero. And they found you amusing for a while, the people of this city. But the one thing they love more than a hero... ...is to see a hero fail, fall, die trying. In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually, they will hate you. Why bother? - Because it's right. - Here's the real truth. There are eight million people in this city. And those teeming masses exist for the sole purpose... ...of lifting the few exceptional people onto their shoulders. You, me... ...we're exceptional. I could squash you like a bug right now. But I'm offering you a choice. Join me. Imagine what we could accomplish together. What we could create. Or we could destroy. Cause the deaths of countless innocents in selfish battle... ...again and again and again until we're both dead. Is that what you want? Think about it, hero. In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually, they will hate you. It's me again. How was your audition? - How'd you know? - The hot line. Your mom... ...told my aunt, told me. So you just came by? I was in the neighborhood. Needed to see a friendly face. I took two buses and a cab to get in the neighborhood, but... So how'd it go? They said I needed acting lessons. A soap opera told me I needed acting lessons. Let me buy you a cheeseburger. The sky's the limit, up to $7.84. I'd like a cheeseburger. Oh, but I'm going out to dinner with Harry. Come with us. No, thanks. How's it going with? Never mind. That's none of my business. It's not? Why so interested? I'm not. You're not? - Well, why would I be? - I don't know. Why would you be? I, that's a... I don't know. Sorry you won't come with us. I'd better run, tiger. Hey, check it out, man. Come on, man. Hey, where you going, baby? Come on! Get off me! Wait! You have a knack for getting in trouble. You have a knack for saving my life. I think I have a superhero stalker. I was in the neighborhood. You are amazing. Some people don't think so. - But you are. - Nice to have a fan. Do I get to say thank you this time? Wait. Let me in! My baby's in there! - Let me go! - The roof's collapsing! - Somebody save my baby! - The roof's about to collapse! Look! Up there! Save my baby, please! No! - It's okay. Your baby's fine. - Oh, my baby! God bless you, Spider-Man. Bless you. Don't let him get away! Hold it! You're under arrest. I'm taking you in. Oh, my God, there's somebody still up there! I'm going. - I'll be here when you get back. - Not coming back. Go! Go! Where are you? Where are you? I'm gonna get you out of here! It's okay. You're pathetically predictable. Like a moth to the flame. What about my generous proposal? Are you in or are you out? - It's you who's out. Out of your mind. - Wrong answer. Oh, great. No one says no to me! - M.J., will you stop goofing around? - Harry, relax. He's here. Are you ready? Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late. Work was murder. I picked up a fruitcake. Thank you, Mr. Osborn. We're so glad you could come. Who is this lovely young lady? I'd like you to meet my father. Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson. I've been looking forward to meeting you. - Happy Thanksgiving, sir. - Now, where is Peter? He'd better remember that cranberry sauce. Oh, that's weird. I didn't know he was here. Peter? Is that you? How strange. There's nobody here. - Bit of a slob, isn't he? - All brilliant men are. - Hey, everyone. - Oh, Peter! It's a jungle out there. Had to beat an old lady with a stick to get these cranberries. Thank you. Now then, everybody sit down... ...and we can say grace. Here we go. - There we are. - It looks delicious. Will you do the honors? Why, Peter, you're bleeding. I stepped off a curb and got clipped by one of those bike messengers. Well, let me see. Oh, my goodness. - That looks awful. - No, it's nothing. I'll get the first-aid kit. Then we'll say grace. This is the boys' first Thanksgiving here, and we'll do things properly. How did you say that happened? Bike messenger. Knocked me down. - If you'll excuse me, I've got to go. - Why? Something has come to my attention. Are you all right? I'm fine, just fine. Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone. - Enjoy the fruitcake. - Dad! I planned this so you'd meet M.J., and now you have to leave? I've got to go. - This girl is important to me. - Harry, please. Look at her. Think she's sniffing around because she likes your personality? - What are you saying? - Your mother was beautiful. They're all beautiful until they're snarling after your money like wolves. You're wrong, Dad. A word to the not-so-wise about your girlfriend: Do what you need to with her, then broom her fast. Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry. - You heard? - Everyone heard that creep. That creep is my father. With luck, I'll be half of what he is. Shut up about stuff you don't understand! Harry Osborn! I'm sorry, Aunt May. Spider-Man is all but invincible. But Parker, we can destroy him. I can't. Betrayal must not be countenanced. Parker must be educated. What do I do? Instruct him in the matters of loss and pain. Make him suffer. Make him wish he were dead. Yes? And then grant his wish. But how? The cunning warrior attacks neither body nor mind. Tell me how! The heart, Osborn. First, we attack his heart. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses... ...as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us... Deliver us! Finish it! - Finish it! - From evil! Two milligrams IV. Get the BP. Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay? What happened? You have to leave. - What happened? - Those eyes! Those horrible yellow eyes! He knows who I am. I'm sorry. - Will she be okay? - She'll be fine. She's been sleeping all day. - Thanks for coming. - Of course. How are you? You okay about the other night? Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad about leaving Aunt May. - Have you talked to Harry? - He called me. I haven't called him back. The fact is... ...I'm in love with somebody else. - You are? At least I think I am. - It's not the time to talk about it. - No. Go on. Would I know his name, this guy? You'll think I'm a little girl with a crush. Trust me. It's funny. He's saved my life twice, and I've never even seen his face. - Oh. Him. - You're laughing at me. No, I understand. He is extremely cool. But do you think it's true, all the terrible things they say? Not Spider-Man, not a chance in the world. I know him a little bit. I'm sort of his unofficial photographer. - Has he mentioned me? - Yeah. What'd he say? I said... He asked me what I thought about you. And what did you say? I said, ""Spider-Man."" I said, ""The great thing about M.J... ...is... ...when you look in her eyes... ...and she's looking back in yours... ...everything feels... ...not quite normal. Because you feel... ...stronger... ...and weaker at the same time. You feel excited... ...and at the same time... ...terrified. The truth is, you don't know what you feel... ...except you know what kind of man you want to be. It's as if you've... ...reached the unreachable... ...and you weren't ready for it."" You said that? Well, something like that. Dad? Dad, is that you? What is it? You were right about M.J. You're right about everything. She's in love with Peter. - Parker? - Yeah. And how does he feel about her? He's loved her since the 4th grade. He pretends like he doesn't, but there's no one Peter cares for more. I'm so sorry. I haven't always been there for you, have I? You're busy. You're an important man. I understand. That's no excuse. I'm proud of you. I've lost sight of that somewhere. But I'll make it up to you. I'm going to rectify certain inequities. Wake up, little spider. Wake up. Go home, dear. You look awful. - And you look beautiful. - Thank you. - I don't like to leave you here. - But I'm safe here. - Can I do anything for you? - You do too much. College, a job, all this time with me. You're not Superman, you know. A smile. Finally. Haven't seen one of those on your face since Mary Jane was here. You were supposed to be asleep. You know, you were about 6 years old when M.J.'s family moved in next door. When she got out of the car, and you saw her for the first time... ...you grabbed me and said, ""Aunt May, is that an angel?"" - Gee, did I say that? - You sure did. Well, Harry's in love with her. - She's still his girl. - Well, isn't that up to her? - She doesn't really know who I am. - Because you won't let her. You're so mysterious all the time. Tell me, would it be so dangerous... ...to let Mary Jane know how much you care? Everybody else knows. I'll be right back. But... Come on, pick up. - Hey M.J. - Hi. Sing your song at the beep. M.J., it's Peter. You there? Hello? You there? I'm just calling to check up on you. Will you call me when you get in? All right, well... Don't... Don't go up any dark alleys. Hello? Can Spider-Man come out to play? Where is she? - What is that? - That's cool! The itsy-bitsy spider Went up the water spout Down came the goblin And took the spider out Goblin, what have you done? Spider-Man! This is why only fools are heroes. Because you never know... ...when some lunatic will come along with a sadistic choice: Let die the woman you love... ...or suffer the little children. - Spider-Man! - Save us! Save us! Make your choice, Spider-Man... ...and see how a hero is rewarded. Don't do it, Goblin! We are who we choose to be. - Now, choose! - No! Everybody stay still! Ahoy up there! We're gonna bring the barge right under you. - He's coming back! - Listen. I need you to climb down. - I can't. - Yes, you can! M.J., you can do it. You have to. Trust me. Hold on tight and go quickly. - Hurry! - I can't. I can't do it. Hang on, Mary Jane! - He's not gonna make it. - He's gonna make it! It's time to die. - I got something for you! - We ought to kick your ass! Leave Spider-Man alone! You'd pick on a guy saving kids? You mess with Spidey, you mess with New York! You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us! Spider-Man, watch out! Misery, misery, misery. That's what you've chosen. I offered you friendship... ...and you spat in my face. You've spun your last web, Spider-Man. Had you not been so selfish, your girlfriend's death... ...would have been quick. But now that you've really pissed me off... ...I'm gonna finish her nice and slow. M.J. and I... ...we're gonna have a hell of a time. Peter, stop! Stop! It's me. Mr. Osborn. Thank God for you. You killed those people on that balcony. The Goblin killed! I had nothing to do with it! Don't let him take me again. I beg you. Protect me. You tried to kill Aunt May. You tried to kill Mary Jane. But not you. I tried to stop it. But I couldn't stop it. I would never hurt you. I knew from the beginning... ...if anything ever happened to me... ...it was you I could count on. You, Peter Parker, would save me, and so you have. Thank God for you. Give me your hand. Believe in me as I believed in you. I've been like a father to you. Be a son to me now. I have a father. His name was Ben Parker. Godspeed, Spider-Man. Peter. Don't tell Harry. What have you done? What have you done?! I'm so sorry, Harry. I know what it's like to lose a father. I didn't lose him. He was stolen from me. One day Spider-Man will pay. I swear on my father's grave, Spider-Man will pay. Thank God for you, Peter. You're the only family I have. No matter what I do... ...no matter how hard I try... ...the ones I love will always be the ones who pay. You must miss him so much. It's been so hard without him. There's something I've been wanting to tell you. When I was up there... ...and I thought I was gonna die... ...there was only one person who I was thinking of. And it wasn't who I thought it'd be. It was you, Pete. I kept thinking: ""I hope I make it through this... ...so I can see Peter Parker's face one more time."" Really? There's only one man who's always been there for me... ...who makes me feel... ...like I'm more than I ever thought I could be. That I'm just... ...me. And that's okay. The truth is... ...I love you. I love you so much, Peter. All I wanted was to tell her how much I loved her. I can't... You can't what? Tell you... ...everything. I mean, there's so much to tell. Yeah. There's so much to tell. I want you to know... ...that I will always be there for you. I will always be there to take care of you. I promise you that. I will always be your friend. Only a friend... ...Peter Parker? That's all I have to give. Whatever life holds in store for me... ...I will never forget these words: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man., - Ally, can we get a recap? - You remember the Kowolskis. They've owned this shop for 30 years, and they are attempting to set a record... by making Buffalo's largest cookie, and you have to wear this. - A hair net? - Health department. - You're kidding me. - If you're working around the cookie...  you have to have it on. It's the law. I just did the hair. The hair is perfect. All right. Give it to me. God, why do you hate me? We're rolling. And speed. For three decades, the Kowolski family bakery... has been a mainstay in downtown Buffalo... known for their sinfully sweet, cream-filled Polski pierogis... and the occasional sugar-induced coma that follows. But today, in honor of their 30th anniversary, they've invited us to ride along as they go for the record... on Buffalo's biggest cookie. Vol. Vol? You need a tissue or something? Can we get Vol a tissue or a spoon? It's a good thing we're wearing these today, 'cause I wouldn't want any stray hairs... to fall into the booger. - Are we gonna do this again? - No. We can cut to B-roll. Moving on! So tell me, Mama. Why make Buffalo's biggest cookie? Well... man from health department say he find rat pellet in our pastry but I say ""No. Is big chocolate sprinkle."" But he shut store down. So we clean up, make big cookie... for to bring customers back. Well, I admire your candor. Let's try that again, shall we? So tell me, Mama. Why make Buffalo's biggest cookie? So the children of the neighborhood will be happy? That's right. It must be wonderful seeing the smiles on their little faces. I work in back. I see no smiles. The previous Buffalo record was eight feet, seven inches, baked by Gladys Pelsnick. If this cookie beats Gladys's, it will prove once and for all... that the Kowolskis have much more free time. And the cookie is... 10 feet, four inches. We have a new record! Cue the cheesy inspirational music! But what are we really looking at here? Is it just a big cookie, or does this cookie represent the pride of Buffalo, its dedicated and hardworking citizens the key ingredient... with a few nuts thrown in... and, finally, the love of our families, which provides the warm, chewy center, making our beloved Buffalo the sweetest place to live. And that's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News. And cut it. So, what do you think? - I think it's really good. - It sucks. It's a story about a cookie. The Pillsbury Doughboy will be riveted. Honey, it was funny. It made me laugh. There's nothing wrong with makin' people laugh. I'll never be an anchorman, not with this. The job's right there, but I can't reach it, because every time they make me do this kinda stuff, I have to act like a total goof in order to make it work. I have no credibility. Not good. Not good. - Ok, you know what? Now you're just sounding silly. - You know what? Forget it. It's not important, right? It's not important. - Let's watch it one more time. - Oh, no. - Just once more. Please? - No. No. Bruce, you promised that you would help me with this photo album. Now, you get your goofy butt over here. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now, you just go through this stack, and you pick your favorites. Oh, come on. This is fun. Right? Isn't this fun? This is nice. Evan's gonna get that anchor job. I just know it. - Oh, Bruce! - He's the favorite. All right. You know what? Just forget it. Let's just forget it. This is just our life. We can always just have some kid do it for us. Whoa! Hold the phone! I like this one. Our weekend at the lake. How did you get that? That's supposed to be in our private stash. - You look perky, hon. It must've been cold. - All right. Just give it to me. I think I'll put this on my computer and use it as wallpaper. - Okay. Give it to me. Come on! - Hey, hey. No, no, no. All right. Fine. Do with it what you will. I don't care. - I will do with it what I will. - Jesus. You know, I might even send this in to Playboy. - I hear their layouts can be quite tasteful. - Give that to me right now! Sweetie? Time to get up. Uh-uh. Good dream. No. Uh-uh. No. Well, the Buffalo Sabres lost again last night... at the hands of the Toronto Maple Leafs. - It was a shootout on the ice for our hometown... - Of course they did. They're my team. And that's the way the cookie crumbles. You know, I think there might be something to this cookie line. All the greatest anchors have had their own signature sign-off. Like Wal-ter Cron-kite. And that's the way it was. And that's the way the cookie crumbles. And that's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, no. Grace, the dog! I'm in the shower! No, Sam! Bad dog! Inside, bad. Outside, good. Inside, bad. Outside, good. Oh, you're done now. Great. B-E-A-utiful. Come on. Let's go back inside and have a shit. - What is the deal-io? - We are having a blood drive. Creepy. Needles. Yuck. Well, they need my blood. I have a very rare blood type. - I'm A.B.-Positive. - Really? I'm I.B.-Positive. I be positive they ain't touchin' me with no needle. It's just so... - Helpful and lifesaving? - No. It's your blood. It's blood. Blood's supposed to stay inside the body. That's where it's meant to be. Besides, they stockpile this stuff in a warehouse somewhere. It's all frozen on ice, and they tell everybody there's a shortage. That's just not true. Where did you hear that? From a very reliable friend of a friend of a girl... whose sister's going out with someone very high up in the government. But for your own protection, I cannot discuss it at this time. - Now, get out before they see us together. - Oh, no. Oh. Here. Hold on a second. You need these more than I do. - What is these? - Prayer beads. The kids made 'em for me. They will keep you safe. I hope they're powerful. I'm gonna need a friggin' miracle to get to work on time. This isn't happening. Not now. Not during sweeps week. Not during sweeps week! Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah. Meeting's started without me. This is my luck. This is my luck! Shit. Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! Jesus.  Get out of there! ""Are you blind?""  No, but I'm late. Is your child in dire jeopardy? - Find out tonight after the game. - Okay. Promos are approved. Uh, Jack, shouldn't we be focusing on Pete's retirement? - I mean, this is his last week. - Yeah, Jack. Any word on the open anchor position? Evan, when I know something, you'll know something. Sorry I'm late. Traffic was... Did you guys already play the spots? It's a nice story, Bruce, but we're gonna go with Evan's piece... sex scandal in the mayor's office... for sweeps. Oh, yeah. Sweeps. And that's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm just messing with you, Bruce. See, you just gotta remember that the newsroom... is like a big cookie. - Do you like jazz, Evan? - Yeah. Let me play something for ya. - I can hold that note all day, buddy. - Knock it off, guys. Bruce, we're gonna keep your story in reserve. Now, can we get back to the board... so we'll have something to put on the air today? Great choice, Jack. This is the Cadillac of bolognas. - Okay. Thanks. - Jack, can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. Sure, Bruce. What do you need? - Sweeps. Jack! Hear me out here. I'm startin' to get desperate, man. I'm pushin' 40, and what have I got to show for it? I've hit some kind of a ceiling here. There's an anti-Bruce barrier I can't get past. And Evan is lovin' it, by the way. Lovin' it. He gets the stories. He gets on sweeps. Maybe I should be more like Evan. You don't wanna be like Evan. Evan's an asshole. - I can be an asshole. - No, Bruce. You can't. - You gonna pick that up? - Yeah. I'm sorry. It's... I'm losin' it. It's just this whole anchor thing opening up has got me nuts. - Hi, Susan. - Hi, Susan.  Hi, Jack. Look, Bruce. You're a good reporter. You make people laugh. All right. I'll tell you what. Today is the 156th anniversary of the Maid of the Mist. - I want you at Niagara Falls in an hour. - Maid of the Mist? - That's always live. - Mm-hmm. - But Evan always does live feeds. - Now you and Evan get the live feeds. - I'm going live? During sweeps? - But watch your step, Bruce. - I've seen your outtakes. - Jack, you will not regret this. And I won't forget you when I go national. Uh, can you... Thanks, pal. Can I have your wish now? I'm gonna put it in the wish jar. Thank you. - Okay. Put your wish in there. - Me too. Put your wish in there. Look at that. Looks like a big wish. Oh, no, no. Oh, no. Martin, don't... don't eat that. Don't eat that. Don't put that in your mouth. That's paste, honey. Ooh. - That must've tasted awful. - Mommy! Oh, Zoe-Baboey! Did you have a good time with Aunt Crazy today? Mm-hmm. Yeah? See how nice this is? Baby on the hip? Oh, it's amazing. You've become Mom. The transformation is complete. I'll get it. - Small Wonders Day Care. - Grace? No. It's Debbie, the sister whose life you're not wasting. - Oh, all right. Okay, okay, okay. - Bye, Debbie! Oops. Hi. Hi. Sorry. Debbie forgot to take her meds today. Where are ya? Oh, a little place called the winner's circle. I'm at the falls doing a live report. - Live? That's great! - Yeah! It's happening, hon. I got sweeps, and I'm live. You know what that means? They're seein' if I can think on my feet, you know, like I might have to do in a live news anchor situation. - Oh, my gosh. - Yeah. It's what we've always talked about, Grace. - Jack practically came out and told me. - Practically? Well, he didn't spell it out, but legally, he can't. But this is exactly what happened to Susan Ortega just before they bumped her up to the desk. It's good. It's good. It's good. Okay. Well, honey, I just don't... I don't want you to get too ahead of yourself. Bruce? Oh, I gotta go. They're callin' me in. Oh. Okay, honey. Good luck. I love you. Love, love, love, love, love. Let's do it. - They want you close to the falls. - Really? - I'm gonna get soaked. - That's the point. They want you to put this on. Part of the condition of us getting the exclusive. You know what? Nothin' can bother me today. Nothin'. Okay. Now, remember. It's their 156th-year anniversary. - 149 capacity. - Right. - They cater to tourists, honeymooners... - And people who are insanely thirsty. - I get it. - Okay. And you are gonna be interviewing Irene Dansfield. Irene! Pleasure to meet you. Truly. - You look beautiful. - Irene's mother rode on the maiden voyage. - Wow. Rub that in my face, why don't ya? - Ninety seconds! Ninety seconds? Holy hell. Uh, yeah. Okay. Ninety seconds? Whoo. Because of the fast response, the toxic chemicals were cleaned up without incident. - Susan? - Bruce Nolan is standing by at Niagara Falls, but before we go live to Bruce, we have an announcement to make. As everyone knows, after 33 years, our beloved Pete Fineman is retiring. Pete's shoes are virtually impossible to fill, But the show must go on, and we could think of no one better... than our very own... Evan Baxter. Ohh... Oh, boy. - Congratulations, Evan. - Thanks, Susan. I'm thrilled and honored. And as you said, no one can replace the great Pete Fineman, but I will do my best. I have to say, I am so proud to be a part of our local community of Buffalo, and I think, in a lot of ways, a great city is like a great recipe, really. You take hardworking citizens, add some caregivers, maybe a few nuts, All sprinkled with the love and support of our good families. Ultimately, that makes one sweet place to live. - That was amazing. - I meant it. - I wish I'd written something. - And now let's go live... to that wacky Bruce Nolan out at Niagara Falls. Hey! Wacky Bruce! Bruce? Talk, Bruce. Hello? Talk, honey. Talk. - What's going on? - We got a Walt Disney. - He's frozen solid. - We may not have audio. Check the feed - We may be having a bit of technical difficulty. - Feed's good, Jack. Move. Come on. Come on. Come on. Talk, Bruce, damn it! All right. Get ready to pull the plug. Oh Come on, baby. Say something. Say something. Bruce, talk. - Hi, Susan. - Oh, thank you, God. Bruce Nolan here aboard the Maid of the Mist in fabulous Niagara Falls, New York. First off, let me just add another congratulations to Evan Backstabber... Pardon me. Bastard. Baxter, rather. It is good to see what someone with real talent can do... when great opportunities are given to them instead of me. Anyway, I'm here with Katharine Hepburn's mom. Tell me. Why did you throw the blue Heart of the Ocean jewel over the railing of the Titanic? Did you feel bad at all letting Leo DiCaprio drown while you were safe, floating on the big door? Could you have taken turns, or were you just too afraid to freeze your big, fat ass off? I guess that's how life is, isn't it? Some people are drenched, freezing to death on a stupid boat... with a stupid hat, while others are in a comfy news studio, suckin' up all the glory. Oh, well. No big deal. Oh, look. It's the owner of the Maid of the Mist. Let's have a talk with him, shall we? - Come on in here, Bill. - That's all right. No, no, no, no. No, no. Come on. Let's have a talk. Come on. What are you doing? Bill, you've been running the Maid of the Mist for 23 years, now tell me. - Why do you think I didn't get the anchor job? - Hey, man. I don't want any problems. Is it my hair, Bill? Are my teeth not white enough? Or like the great falls, is the bedrock of my life... eroding beneath me? Eroding! Eroding! Eroding! Cut the feed. Go to black. - Go to black. - I'm on it. I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness News. Back to you, fuckers! Oh, my God. That is perfect. That is the motivation that I needed! Right there! Thank you. Thank you, W.K.B.W! Wimpy Kitty Baby Whiners! That's what that stands for! I'll see you on Channel 5, where they do the real news. Do I look blind to you? Do I look blind to you? - Hey. - Let's go, man. Come on. Let's go. What are you doing over there? Come on. Leave the poor guy alone. You okay, man? Yeah, you better keep walkin'. What? What'd you say, ese? Run, man! Run! Oh, God! Okay, okay, okay! I didn't mean it! I was just kiddin'! Hey, you forgot your things. Say somethin' to that. Say somethin'. B-E-A... utiful. That's what I get... That's what I get for trying to help someone. Oh, don't look at me, Walter. Oh, no! Well, that's my payment, I guess. That... That is my reward. Just? Just get a clue! - Oh thank God you're all right. - God, yeah. Let's thank God, shall we? For his blessings are raining down upon me. - Wait! That's not rain! - Bruce, please don't do that, honey. You know that everything happens for a reason. That I don't need. That is a cliche. That is not helpful to me. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. I have no bird. I have no bush. God has taken my bird and my bush. Oh, I see. So God is picking on you, is that what you're saying? No. He's ignoring me completely. He's far too busy giving Evan everything he wants. Oh, that's great, Sam, but you missed your target. I'm over here! Don't get mad at the dog. It's not the dog's fault. No. It's God's fault. I gave him the wrong coordinates. All right. You know what? Enough. All right? Will you stop being such a martyr? I am not being a martyr. I'm a victim. God is a mean kid sitting on an anthill with a magnifying glass, and I'm the ant. He could fix my life in five minutes if he wanted to, but he'd rather burn off my feelers and watch me squirm! Sweetheart, I know you're mad. It's completely understandable. What Evan did is slimy and wrong, but this day could've been so much worse. - I'm just glad you're okay. - Okay? News flash! I'm not okay. I'm not okay with a mediocre job! I'm not okay with a mediocre apartment. I'm not okay with a mediocre life! So is that what you think that we have? A mediocre life? - Don't make this about you. - About me? How could I make this about me? It's about you! It's always about you! Perfect. Perfect. I'll have the worst day of my life with a side order of guilt, please! Okay, God. You want me to talk to you? Then talk back. Tell me what's going on. What should I do? Give me a signal. Oh, I need your guidance, Lord. Please send me a sign. Ah, what's this joker doin' now? Okay. All right. I'll try it your way. All right. Lord, I need a miracle. I'm desperate. I need your help, Lord. Please reach into my life. Hey! What the he... I got ya! Fine! The gloves are off, pal! Come on! Let me see a little wrath. Smite me, Oh mighty smiter! You're the one who should be fired! The only one around here not doing his job is you! Answer me! Sorry. Don't know ya. Wouldn't call you if I did. Ohh. Oh, God. Ohh. Hello 555 0123. Oh, no! Sam, this has gotta stop. All right. Now, get it straight here. That's the house. This is the bathroom. House. Bathroom. Bathroom. House. House. Bathroom. Bathroom. House. What's the point? Denied that promotion at work? Is life unfair? Is there someone less talented than you reaping all the benefits? Is your name Bruce? Then do we have the job for you. We're located at 77256 23rd Street. So come on down, or we'll just keep beeping you. ""Omni Presents"" Oh, yeah. The glass is half full. Oh, geez! Come on! Look! What is that? What is that? Ah, geez! Thank you. Thank you again. What the... You're looking for Room 7. Yeah. I figured. You want me to even those up for you? How do I get to Room 7? That'll be on the seventh floor. Stairs are right over there. - I'd rather take the elevator. - Out of order. I love the stairs though. They were my second choice. Do you mind giving me a hand with this floor? What? That's good. Are you serious? Oh, uh, I'm kind of busy. - Um, rain check. - I'll hold you to it. I'm free on the seventh at 7:00. Seventh at 7:00 it is. This looks promising. Hello? Another ""hugantic,"" ""ginormic"" waste of my life. Hello? - Yo! I'm lookin' for whoever runs this joint. - Be right with ya. I'm trying to fix a light. Tell me if it's working. Yeah. Seems to be. - Kind of bright, though. - Yeah. It is for most people. Spend their lives in the dark trying to hide from me. Oh, the elevator's broken, huh? Yeah, but I'll get around to it. - You install the Clapper? - No, but catchy jingle, isn't it? ""Clap on, clap off"" ""Clap on, clap off the Clapper"" Just can't get it out of my head. Well, good luck with that. I'm gonna go now. Okay. But the boss'll be right out. You must be Bruce. I've been expecting you. This is hilarious. So you're the boss and the electrician and the janitor? Must be a killer Christmas party. Don't get drunk, though. One of you might need a ride home. You always were funny, Bruce, just like your father. He didn't mind rolling up his sleeves, either, son. People underestimate the benefit of good old manual labor. There's freedom in it. Some of the happiest people in the world... go home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day. All right. What is this? How do you know my father, and how did you get my pager number? Oh, I know quite a lot about you, Bruce... Just about everything there is to know. Everything you've ever said or done or thought about doing... Right there in that file cabinet. Wow. A whole drawer just for me. - Yeah. - Mind if I take a look? - It's your life. - This oughta be good. Now, this last entry was a little disturbing. ""The gloves are off, God."" ""God has taken my bird and my bush."" ""God is a mean kid with a magnifying glass."" ""Smite me, Oh mighty smiter!"" Now, I'm not much for blaspheming, but that last one made me laugh. Are you spying on me? Who are you? I'm the one. - Huh? - Creator of the Heavens and the Earth... Alpha and Omega. Oh, I see where this is going. Bruce, I'm God. Bingo! Yahtzee! Is that your final answer? Our survey says, ""God!"" Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing! Well, it was nice to meet you, God. Thank you for the Grand Canyon, and good luck with the Apocalypse. Oh, and by the way, you suck! You know what would've been a little more impressive, though? If you hadn't used the cheesy file cabinet illusion. Anybody with a brain stem can tell that that drawer... is being fed through the wall from the other side. All you have to do is find the crease, right around here. There is a seam here... or a hollow spot. Where? Through the drywall and concrete? Okay. That is a good one. That is a good one. - Okay. How many fingers am I holding up? - Now, Bruce. - Thou shalt not tempt the Lord... - Hey, if you can't do it, man, that's cool. Three. Two. Four. Nine. Six. Eight. One. Okay. How many now? - Seven. - Aha! You've been doing a lot of complaining about me, Bruce. - And quite frankly, I'm tired of it. - Wait. Don't come near me, seriously. When I'm backed into a corner, I'm like a wild animal. - I don't wanna hurt you, but I will, out of instinct. - You haven't won a fight... since grade five, and that was against a girl. Yeah, but she was huge. She had been held back. And the sun was in your eyes. Oh, there you go. Anyway, I brought you here to offer you a job. - Job? What job? - My job. You think you can do it better, so here's your chance. When you leave this building, you will be endowed with all my powers. Sure, whatever you say, pal. Okay. That did not happen, and no one needs to hear about it. I'm deleting the program. No. No. I'm having a breakdown, that's what it is. Normal, everyday psychotic episode caused by a tumor or brain lesion. Come on. Start! That was lucky. Come on, man. Calm down. You did not meet God; you do not have his powers. If that was God, then I'm Clint Eastwood. Holy hell! Be careful what you wish for, punk. No. Uh-uh! No. No. I am a reasonable, sane human being with a. 44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the wo... I'm not Clint Eastwood. I'm Bruce Nolan. Bruce Nolan. I'm Bruce No-lan! Oh, it's not real. It's not real. - Coffee? - Yeah. Uh, coffee. Yeah. - We have a special on soup today. - No. That's fine. No, thank you. It's tomato. I made it myself. - Okay. - Okay. Excuse me. I need a sp... It's okay. I found one. Here's your soup. Oh, soup. Right. Uh, yeah. Right. Having fun? Thy... Thou... Come. Take a closer walk with me. - Let me explain the rules. - Rules? Yeah. You left in such a rush, I didn't get a chance to explain. Two extra fingers freaked me out a little bit. I just figured I'd get your attention. I did the same thing to Gandhi; he didn't eat for three weeks. Anyway, here's the deal. You have all my powers. Use them any way you choose. There are only two rules. You can't tell anybody you're God. Believe me, you don't want that kind of attention. And you can't mess with free will. Uh-huh. Can I ask why? Yes, you can! That's the beauty of it! - This is amazing. - Speaking of amazing... Excuse me. Oh. Holy sh... cow. Since you're through with these, I think I'll keep 'em. Might come in handy someday. See you around, kid. - Where you going? - I'm taking a vacation. God doesn't take vacations, does he? Do... ye? Did you ever hear of the Dark Ages? Besides, I'm covered. You can clear everything up in five minutes if you want to, right? Ciao. ""I've got the power"" Boom! And he saw that it was good. Whoa. B-E-A-utiful. - Hey. Check it out. Check it out. - Hey. Check it out. Oh, look. It's the hero. What's up, homie? Yo, brethren, what up with thee? Blessings on your alley. Looking for another can of whoop-ass? - You didn't get enough, Mr. Hero? - He wants some more. Surely I say unto you dudes, I do not wish to fight. So as soon as you apologize and make a full reckoning of your transgressions, I shall absolve you and continue along the path of righteousness. What are you talkin' about, man? Straight up. You talk kind of funny, you know what I mean? I don't know if you've lost it all up in here or what, but check this out, homie. You want me and the homies to apologize, right? I'll tell you what. We'll apologize the day a monkey comes out of my butt. Then you get your ""sorry."" How about that? What a coincidence, because that's today. Hey, did that monkey just come out your crack, man? This is some voodoo shit, man. Vmonos! Let's go! Are you guys leavin'? Hey, don't forget your parting gifts! Hey, little anal-dwelling butt monkey. Time for you to go home, little buddy. I am Bruce Almighty! My will be done! ""What if God was one of us"" ""Just a slob like one of us"" ""Just a stranger on a bus"" ""Tryin'to make his way"" ""Home"" - Oh my God. - You can call me Bruce. What happened to you? You seem so... happy. - Why shouldn't I be... on a night like this? - Wow. - Those are amazing. What are these? - They're a new breed. Cross-pollination between tulips and daisies. I call them tu-daisies. Okay. Honey, these flowers are really beautiful, but last night... Last night, I was only human. Barry, help me out here. Honey. Hi. Wow. - I've never seen the moon that big! - Yeah. We really shouldn't waste it. - Bedroom? - Five minutes. Let there be light. I'll be out in a minute. Don't rush yourself. Sometimes anticipation can heighten the pleas-ure. Oh, God! Oh! It's a funny thing about pleasure. It can be quite... pleasurable! Oh, my God! - Pleasurable. - Oh, God! Oh, good God! Pleasurable. Pleasurable. In international news, Japanese relief workers are staging a desperate effort... to rescue hundreds of people stranded by a freak tidal wave that hit Kitamoto City. Scientists say the tsunami may have been caused by what they're describing... as unusual lunar activity. More on this as it develops. Please bless my mommy, my daddy and especially my little sister. Please help me, Lord. Please get me through this one. All I'm asking is would you help me? Thank you for everything else in my life. Amen. Sam! Good boy. Ah... Forget something? Hmm. Good boy. There are girls in the house, huh? - Morning. - Good morning! - I made you grilled cheese. - Ooh, my favey! - Honey, last night was just... - Heavenly? I know. I know. I mean, I woke up this morning, and I felt like my boobs were bigger. Ohh. I mean, do they look bigger to you? Uh, what? Your, um, hmm? No. Uh... - Bigger? - Oh, come on! Look at them! Please. They are definitely bigger. I mean, look. They feel huge to me. Well, listen, I, uh, have to go, but this has been the breast bek... breast... - Thank you. - Where are you going? To get my job back. ""Yeah, yeah"" ""I am great. Yeah, yeah"" ""I am..."" Good grief. Is that what I'm drivin'? Whoa. Nice car, man. Yeah. It gets me from ""A"" to ""B."" Oh, darn. All this horsepower and no room to gallop. Heigh-ho, Silver, away! I certainly wouldn't want to be a fugitive on the run with Hank, Buffalo's number-one police dog on the job. This is Phil Sidleman reporting from the Police Canine Training Center, Channel 5 News. And cut it. Hey, hey, hey! Look what the cat coughed up! Channel 7, right? You're the guy that went crazy? I had a bad moment. - What are you doing here? - Just looking for a story. There's no story here. This pond is all fished out. - Standard stuff anyway. - I don't know. - My instinct tells me there's something more. - Yeah? Well, go with that. It served you well in the past, right? Hey! Hank found something! Hey, we got a body! Over here! Get the camera! Now! - It's locked, and the keys are inside! - I guess every dog has his day. Hey, kid. You wanna make 10 bucks? You know how to use one of these things? Duh. Seems to be in tune. Let's do this. The body of Jimmy Hoffa was uncovered in a field today outside of a canine training center in Buffalo, New York. - Bruce Nolan was the first on the scene. - Thank you, Jane. As you can see behind us, the body is being carefully exhumed... and will be transported to a medical facility, where D.N.A. Testing can confirm the identity. That, however, merely a formality at this point, as in a bizarre twist, the body was found buried with a birth certificate... and complete set of dental records. I'd call that a red-letter day for any K-9 unit, but was that enough for old Hank here? No, sirree. Moments later, he busted a local news camera crew... With 220 pounds of marijuana. I never saw it before, I swear! I'm Bruce Nolan, and that's the way the cookie crumbles. Yeah! Did you like that? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. - Hi, Bruce. - Oh, hi, Susan. Good work. I'm impressed. - Jack, did you need me for something? - Bruce! Bruce! - Just the man I wanna see. - Hey. - Hoffa? What are the odds of that? - What are the odds of that? - Bruce, why don't you sit down? - Okay. I'm gonna be straight with you. We want you back, Bruce. But I want you to understand it was not my decision to let you go. - When the big guy gives the order, you know... - No harm, no foul, Jack. I needed some time to reassess my goals and get in touch with my true self. - You did that in a day? - Imagine what I could do with seven. Look, Bruce. It is not in my power to give you anchor. Now, as far as field reporting goes, if you're looking for a bump... Jack, let's just cut the crap and get down to brass tacks here. I'm kidding with you, and you... I had you going, Jackie. Don't even worry about it, my old friend. You just give me a camera, Jack; I'll give you the news. My secret is that I let the jalapeos marinate... in a spicy sauce for at least 24 hours before I stir it into the chili. Then I let it all come to a simmer b... Oh! Hold that thought, Hazel! It seems as if an asteroid or some kind of meteorite... has just hit ground right outside the Mark Twain Chili Cook-Off. This should certainly spice things up a bit. - His stories are all over town. - From unearthing Jimmy Hoffa... To a meteor crashing to earth... Bruce Nolan is rapidly becoming known as... And that's the way the cookie crumbles! - Was this Bruce's idea? - Uh-huh. He said he wanted me to have a day of beauty and luxurious serenity. I gotta tell you. He is really impressing me lately. You know where he's taking me to dinner tonight? Hmm. Where? - The Blue Palm? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, my gosh. I just got chills. - I know. And he told me to prepare for the most memorable night of our entire lives. Oh, my gosh. Grace, he's gonna propose. Oh, stop it. No. Really? Yeah. Really. Come on. You do the math. He sends you all day to a beauty spa. He's taking you to the most romantic restaurant in town, where you had your first date. You know, I never thought I'd say this, but Bruce is right. This is your big night. - Relax and enjoy it. - Oh, God. Ow. Wow. Welcome to Eyewitness News at 6:00 with Susan Ortega, Evan Baxter, Fred Donohue... sports, Dallas Coleman... weather. And now, Buffalo's number-one news team. Good evening, and welcome to Eyewitness News at 6:00. I'm Susan Ortega. And I'm Evan Baxter, and here's what's making news. A potential scandal with the Buffalo P.D. surfaced today... when the mayor... - I'm sorry. I'm seem to have something stuck in my... - Somebody get him some water, please. Looks like my new co-anchor may need a glass of water. Oh. There we go. Sorry about that. In other news, the prime minister of Sweden visited Washington today, and my tiny little nipples went to France. What did he just say? Check the prompter. The prompter's fine. Evan, read the copy, please. The copy's good. Just read it. The White House reception committee greeted the prime rib roast minister, and I do the cha-cha like a sissy girl. I ""lika"" do the cha-cha. I'm sorry. We seem to be having some technical difficulties. In other news... My apologies. - May I? - Certainly. It's perfect. She'll love it. You know, uh... I was gonna, uh... I was gonna wait until after the meal, but i think it's gonna burst out of me like an alien if I don't do it now. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Okay. This is it, isn't it? I don't know. I don't know if I'm ready for this. I mean, I'm ready for this. I just don't know if I would... I didn't think I would have... I'm sorry. Go on. I didn't know this was so important to you. Me neither. Me neither. Oh. - Grace. - Yes? - Grace. - Yes? I got anchor. Yes. Apparently, it wasn't working out with Evan, so he's gonna finish out the week, and I go live on Monday. - That's great, honey. That's great. - I know. I know. Wow. So that's what this is all about? - Well, yeah. - Yeah. Grace, we got anchor. Jack's throwing me a party Friday night... at the Vanderbilt estate to celebrate. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Now I lay me down to sleep. Oh, I feel so stupid. I feel stupid. Wow, it is kinda loud in here, isn't it? - No, it's not loud. - Geez, keep it down to a dull roar? - What are you... - Thank you. Is that supposed to be funny? 'Cause that is not funny. What are you saying? What is wrong with you? Stop yelling! Uh, would you excuse me? I think I'll take a little trip to the, um... The wine is going right through me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. - Keep going, Tony! You're great! - Oh, God. What is going on here? Oh, what is this? Give me a break! Really something, isn't it? Is this heaven? No, this is Mount Everest. You should flip on the Discovery Channel from time to time. But I guess you can't now, being dead and all. I'm dead? Nah, I'm just messin' with ya. That's not funny, man. That is not funny! Okay. And what about the voices in my head? - Is that part of the hilarity? - No, those are prayers. And you keep ignoring them, they're gonna build up on you like that. But it's just noise. I can't understand them. Well, you're not listening, son. Let's see. You've had my powers for a little over a week now. How many people have you helped? I took care of a few things. I righted a few wrongs in my own life first, okay? I was gonna help the others. I think I could help the world. - The world? - Mm-hmm. That wasn't the world. That was just Buffalo between 57th Street and Commonwealth. Oh. I didn't want to start you off with more than you could handle. Well, you took the job, Bruce, so I suggest you get to it. Prayers, prayers. Okay, prayers. Oh! This creepy whisper thing has to end. Organization and management is what I need. I need a system. Something concrete. Concentrate! Files. Let all prayers be organized into files. Well, that takes care of the voices. Not exactly a space saver though. Grace might notice. I know. Prayer Post-Its! Okay, I need something with a lock, security, combination, a password. A password. You've got prayers. Welcome to the revelation superhighway. We bless. No mess. Downloading now. It's good. It's good. This is gonna take a while. 1,527,503 prayer requests? I'd better manifest some coffee. Hola! Juan Valdez. - Buenos das. - Buenos das. - Disfrute de un buen caf! - Gracias, senor. Adios. Adios! Ah! Now, that's fresh mountain-grown coffee from the hills of Colombia. It's good. It's good! Okay, I had to have made some kind of a dent by now. Oh, come on! What a bunch of whiners. This is gonna suck up my whole life. You know what? Yes, to all! Yeah, there ya go. Now everybody's happy. I'll drink to that. My tech stocks tripled in five days. You know something, Joe? - You seem taller. - I am. My daughter pitched a no-hitter. I lost 47 pounds on the Krispy Kreme diet. Hey, there he is, the man of the hour! Bless you. Bless all of you. Be fruitful and do long division or something. Hey, try that. It's an excellent year. Hey, Bruce. Who do you like in the game tonight? I like the Sabres. Coach prays a lot. Hey, this is Bruce, Grace and Sam. Leave a message. Grace, are you there? Hello. It's me. Hello? Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello. Come on, Grace. Come to the party. I'll call you later, okay? Come on, Sam. Help me out here. Oh, Sam, don't! Come on! - Come on. Tell me. - If I told you, it might not come true. What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You... You want the moon? Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down. Hey, that's a pretty good idea. - I'll give you the moon, Mary. - I'll take it. Then what? Well, then you could swallow it, and it'll all dissolve, see? The moonbeams would shoot out of your fingers and your toes... And the ends of your hair. Hey, this is Bruce, Grace and Sam... Hi, Bruce. What are you doing in here all alone? Oh, I was just gonna... Oh, uh, I mean... I was gonna, uh, give Grace a call. Yeah, I didn't see her in there. So, how are you and Grace doing? Well, actually, we had a-a bit of a fight. Kind of... I'm not sure if she's... - You're on fire, Bruce. - Hmm? Some women can't handle the fire. Some can. That's interesting, 'cause, you know, I never thought... we would ever talk. Grace! Aah! You might wanna stop touching me. Now is not a good time. Grace! Grace! Grace, come here! Grace, this is so weird. I was just calling you. Oh, yeah. What? And you thought, like, Susan's mouth was the phone? I... She kissed me. I didn't... I'm the ""kissee"" Grace... Oh, please. Yeah, you were putting up a really big fight. I tried to fight her off. I tried to stop her, but she's really strong. Okay, I screwed up. Can I make it up to you? Yeah! Why don't you, uh, get me a boat, Bruce. - What? - Yeah, a big boat. And then maybe two big bags of cash. Then... Then I'll be happy. Lots of money and lots of stuff. Other people want idiotic crap like getting married... or having babies with the man that they've loved for five years. But not me, Bruce. Just gimme the boat. No wonder you stayed single! - Oh! Grace, don't do this! - I'm not doing this. I'm undoing it. I'll be at Debbie's. You take care of Sam until I can make arrangements. You can't leave me. I'm the Alpha, lady! I'm the Omega, baby! Okay, fine. I don't need you. What's the matter, Bruce? She can't handle a little competition? The game's been called on account of rain. An unusually high number of lottery winners... has New York officials concerned. So far, 1,100 winning tickets have been turned in, all strangely from the Buffalo area. More on this story as it develops. Enjoying your party? Nothing like spending quality time with great friends, huh? Grace left me. Yeah, I know. She'll take me back. She'll take me back, right? Would you take you back? How do you make somebody love you without affecting free will? Welcome to my world, son. You come up with an answer to that one, you let me know. Rise and shine, Buffalo. It's 70 and sunny, and the perfect day to forgive Bruce. Bye. - Have fun, you got it. Hi. - Can I get a small coffee to go? - Sure, hon. Just a sec. K-Tel Records brings you the 100 greatest love songs of all time. You'll hear such classics as ""All You Need Is Bruce."" ""If You Can't Be With The One You Love, Then Love Bruce.""

Go to the bathroom, please. Wash out your mouth. Wash off your hands. God, I swear that kid is gonna poop an ornament. One more time, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. All right. That's it! That's it! Hi. I surrender! I surrender! I surrender. - Hi. - Hi. I'm, uh, doing my first anchor tonight. Oh, wow! That's great! - So how have you been doing? - Good. - Yeah? - Yeah. Good. Just, um... Debbie won the lottery. Oh, yeah? You're kidding. But I guess so did 400,000 other people, so she only won, like, $17. I miss you. Okay. I took the first step. Jumped out on the ledge. - Feeling pretty vulnerable too. - I don't know what you want me to say. - Just say you love me and you want me back. - No, Bruce. Come on. What about all the signs? How did you know about that? Did you talk to Debbie? Look, would it help if I just said that I was a complete ass? - Hey, you said ""ass."" - Yeah, but it's okay if I'm talking about a donkey. - I didn't say ""hole."" If I said ""ass""... - Wait! Wait! Okay, you know what, honey? Let's go. Let's go inside. All right, kids. Everybody inside. Time to go inside. Grace, please... none of this seems right without you. Yeah, I gotta go. Wait! Uh... How do you feel now? Have you completely lost your mind? - What? Are you drunk? - Yeah, I'm drunk. Drunk with power. Love me. Love me. Love me. Love me! I did. Yeah, I know... free will. More power outages reported today... caused by last week's meteorite strike. Officials are desperately trying to repair several transformers... damaged by the ensuing electrical surge. The scene nearly turned violent when hundreds of disgruntled Buffalo residents... protested last week's lottery results. And doomsayers are pointing to last week's strange celestial events... as signs that prophesy is now being fulfilled... and the world as we know it may be coming to an end. The world's gone mad. - Bruce, 30 seconds to air. - Okay. Okay. There you are. It's your big debut. How are you feeling? You know what? Fine. Never better. Show must go on, right? The Sabres just won the Stanley Cup. - You're kidding me! Was that tonight? That's great, isn't it? - It's getting pretty crazy out there. - Uh-huh. - We're gonna kick live to Fred at the stadium, okay? - Five seconds to the open. - This is it. You ready? - Born that way. Welcome to Eyewitness News at 6:00, with Susan Ortega, Bruce Nolan, Fred Donohue... sports... Dallas Coleman... weather. And now, Buffalo's number-one news team. - I'm Susan Ortega. - I'm Bruce Nolan. And here's what's making news. - What happened? What the hell happened? - We lost power. - Transformer's down again. - Oh, geez. Ever since that damn meteorite hit. It's okay. We're back up. We apologize for the interruption. And now back to the news. Bruce. - Thank you, Susan. - I'm sorry. We're going live to H.S.B.C. Arena, where the Buffalo Sabres have won the Stanley Cup. - Great. - Fred? We're about to uncork some champagne because... the Sabres have won their first championship in 22 years! What in the blue blazes... We'll be back with the Sabres' Stanley Cup victory in just a hot second. In other news... Bloody hell! - For the love of God, what is it now? - The whole booth is down. No, it's not! In other news, fighting erupted in... the Gaza Strip today, as Israelis and Palestinians... - Bruce. - What?! We've got a situation here. - They're rioting right outside the station. - You're kidding. The whole town is going crazy. Come on, Bruce. Say something. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, this just in. Possibly... the biggest breaking news story this town has ever seen. And I gotta go. I'm sorry, Jack. Susan, it's all yours. Repent! The end is near! Repent! Come back with my bubble gum machine! Come back here! The lottery sucks! I only won 17 bucks! Channel 7 fries! Oh! Oh, no! God? Are you here? Hello? I need your help. Clap on. Clap on. Clap on! Clap on! Clap on! Figures! Well, hello there, Bruce Almighty. Not as easy as it looks, is it, son? - This God business. - They're all out of control. It's mayhem. I don't know what to do. Well, you're right on time... 7:00. The seventh at 7:00. All righty then. - There we are. - It's good. It's good! It's a wonderful thing. No matter how filthy something gets, you can always clean it right up. There were so many, I just gave them all what they wanted. Yeah, but since when... does anyone have a clue about what they want? So what do I do? Parting your soup is not a miracle, Bruce. It's a magic trick. A single mom who's working two jobs... and still finds time to take her kid to soccer practice, that's a miracle. A teenager who says 'no' to drugs and 'yes' to an education, that's a miracle. People want me to do everything for them. But what they don't realize is... They have the power. You wanna see a miracle, son? Be the miracle. Wait. Are you leaving? Yeah. I see that you can handle things now. But what if I need you. What if I have questions? That's your problem, Bruce. That's everybody's problem. You keep looking up. Order has been restored in Buffalo... after this evening's downtown riot. State officials have suspended all lottery sales... pending further investigation. No injuries were reported in the melee. However, there were dozens... Okay. Well, thanks a million. - Oh, not a problem. - God bless. Bruce giveth... and Bruce taketh away. If you don't like it, megabyte me. - Evan. - Bruce. I suppose you're here to gloat about the anchor position. Go ahead. Take your best shot. Well actually, I, uh... I just came to tell you that I've been a royal prick. The anchor position is yours. I turned down the job. Oh, and I never really congratulated you in the first place. Congratulations. Thanks, Bruce. In the financial world, things are settling back to normal... in what analysts are calling a fluke market fluctuation. - You made the right move, Jack. - So what about you? Are you ready to go back out there? And do the cutesy stuff? The lighter side of the news? Lower and debase myself for the amusement of total strangers? Yeah, I could do that. Sounds like fun. Good. Okay, Sammy, let's do it right, like all the other dogs. I don't wanna make you feel bad, but they're laughing at you, pal. They're laughing at you. Ok, come on. Concentrate. There you go. Come on. Pump it out if you have to. What am I gonna do with you? I know this seems kinda crazy, but desperate times... calls for desperate measures. Yeah. Ok. Ok, Sammy. Do your thing. That's it. That's it. Good boy! Training my dog. Yes, we did it! We did it! Bow-wow-wow Yippee-yo, yippee-yay We're doin'it doggy style I'll alert Penthouse Forum. Hi, Deb. How are ya? How's Grace? I really didn't come to chat, okay, Bruce? I came for Grace's stuff. You need, uh... No, it's okay. I've got it. I don't, uh... I don't know if she... I don't know if she wants that or not. This is full. You did all this? You know what I do every night before I go to bed? I tuck my kids in, maybe have a scoop of ice cream and watch Conan. You know what Grace does? She prays. Most of the time for you. Find Grace Connelly. The woman does pray a lot. Find Grace, then Bruce. ""Dear God, please help Bruce find himself, ""find contentment, find you."" ""Dear God, please help Bruce. He seems to be struggling."" ""Dear God, give Bruce strength."" ""Dear God, bless Bruce."" ""Bruce. Bruce. Bruce."" It's her. Sammy, it's her. She's logging on. She's praying right now. Grace. Please, God. Please. I still love him. But I don't wanna love him anymore. I don't wanna hurt anymore. Please. Help me forget. Please help me let him go. Please help me let him go. You win! I'm done! Please, I don't wanna do this anymore. I don't wanna be God. I want you to decide what's right for me. I surrender to your will! Am I... You can't kneel down in the middle of a highway and live to talk about it, son. But why? Why now? Bruce... you have the divine spark. You have the gift for bringing joy and laughter to the world. I know. I created you. - Quit braggin'. - See. That's... That's what I'm talking about. That's the spark. What do you want me to do? I want you to pray, son. Go ahead. Use them. Uhm... Lord, feed the hungry. And bring peace to... all of mankind. - How's that? - Great. If you wanna be Miss America. Now, come on. What do you really care about? Grace. Grace. You want her back? No. I want her to be happy. No matter what that means. I want her to find someone... who will treat her... with all the love... she deserved from me. I want her to meet someone... who will see her always... as I do now... through your eyes. Now, that's a prayer. Yeah? Yeah. - It's good. - It's good. It's good! I'm gonna get right on it. - Clear! - Whoa! - That didn't feel very good. - Clear! Got a rhythm. - All right. I got a pulse. - All right. Let's set him up. Yeah. Get the backboard and brace. Bruce? Bruce? Welcome back. You're lucky to be alive, son. Someone up there must like you. I hear all that stuff winds up in a warehouse somewhere. Grace. Hi, baby. Oh. Oh, my God, look at you. - I was such an idiot. - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I don't know what I would have done. Oh, God. I swear I wanted to be mad at you forever. Now you're just showing off. This is Bruce Nolan here at Buffalo's First-Annual ""Be the Miracle"" Blood Drive. It's a B-E-A-utiful day, so come on down here. Because the life you save could be mine. - Ha, ha. - Let's go over here, where the Kowolskis have baked a very special cookie just for this occasion. Sure, it's a little creepy and a shameless plug, but we love 'em. Thank you, Mama. Vol, finger... nose. I, myself, will have given blood twice this week. For those of you who haven't heard, I'd like to introduce you to the future Mrs. Exclusive... Grace Connelly. There she is. Look at her! Isn't she beautiful? She just gave blood, and she still has enough left to fill up her face. Yes, behind every great man, there's a woman rolling her eyes, folks. I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness News, with all the folks down here at the blood drive, reminding you to... Be the miracle! You heard 'em. Okay, cut it. Thank you, Bruce. Thanks, Ally. Hey. - How was that? - That was great. That was really great. Now, you still have to go over there. - The nurse is waiting. - Oh, do I have to? Oh, it's not gonna hurt. In fact, I think you'll find it quite pleasurable. Ooh, baby. Who can take a rainbow, wrap it in a sigh? ""Soak it in the sun and make a groovy lemon pie"" - Oompah. - Loompah. Doompah. Oh, geez. I'm sorry. I'm a very rare blood type. I'm A.B.-Positive. Hmm. Sounds delicious. Yeah, well, there, you know, there are storehouses all over the world. You know, all over the... with... with tons of stuff on ice. - And it's... Sorry. - You're like this. Sorry. Go on. Okay. Positive. I.B.-Positive. Okay, sorry. - I have a ""rarey""... - Oh! She has a ""rarey."" Okay. Well, they need my blood. I have a very rare blood type. - I'm A.B.-Negative. - I'm I.B.-Positive. - Am I A.B.-Negative or am I... - I don't know what you are anymore. I'm gonna need a frickin' miracle to get to work on time. Shit. Shit! That won't work. Other stories in the n-n-n-n-n-n... The prime minister of Sweden visited Washington today. And in other... In other... In other news... I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness No... Eyewitness Nose. Okay, and clear. Be the miracle. That's right., Although each of the world's countries would like to dispute this fact, we French know the truth: The best food in the world is made in France. The best food in France is made in Paris. And the best food in Paris, some say, is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau. Gusteau's restaurant is the toast of Paris, booked five months in advance. And his dazzling ascent to the top of fine French cuisine has made his competitors envious. He is the youngest chef ever to achieve a five-star rating. Chef Gusteau's cookbook, Anyone Can Cook! Climbed to the top of the bestseller list. But not everyone celebrates its success. Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook! What's even more amusing is that Gusteau actually seems to believe it. I, on the other hand, take cooking seriously. And, no, I don't think anyone can do it. This is me. I think it's apparent I need to rethink my life a little bit. What's my problem? First of all, I'm a rat. Which means life is hard. And second, I have a highly developed sense of taste and smell. Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean... Oh! Small twist of lemon. Whoa, you can smell all that? You have a gift. This is Emile, my brother. He's easily impressed. So you can smell ingredients? So what? This is my dad. He's never impressed. He also happens to be the leader of our clan. So, what's wrong with having highly developed senses? - Don't eat that! - What's going on here? Turns out that funny smell was rat poison. Suddenly, Dad didn't think my talent was useless. I was feeling pretty good about my gift, until Dad gave me a job. Clean. Clean. That's right. Poison checker. Cleanerific. Cleanerino. Close to godliness. Which means clean. You know, cleanliness is close to... Never mind. Move on. Well, it made my dad proud. Now, don't you feel better, Remy? You've helped a noble cause. Noble? We're thieves, Dad. And what we're stealing is, let's face it, garbage. It isn't stealing if no one wants it. If no one wants it, why are we stealing it? Let's just say we have different points of view. This much I knew: If you are what you eat, then I only want to eat the good stuff. But to my dad... Food is fuel. You get picky about what you put in the tank, your engine is gonna die. Now shut up and eat your garbage. Look, if we're going to be thieves, why not steal the good stuff in the kitchen, where nothing is poisoned? First of all, we are not thieves. Secondly, stay out of the kitchen and away from the humans. It's dangerous. I know I'm supposed to hate humans, but there's something about them. They don't just survive. They discover, they create. I mean, just look at what they do with food. GUS TEAU ON TV: How can I describe it? Good food is like music you can taste, color you can smell. There is excellence all around you. You need only be aware to stop and savor it. Oh, Gusteau was right. Oh, mmm, yeah. Oh, amazing. Each flavor was totally unique. But combine one flavor with another, and something new was created. So now I had a secret life. The only one who knew about it was Emile. Hey, Emile. Emile. I found a mushroom. Come on, you're good at hiding food. Help me find a good place to put this. He doesn't understand me, but I can be myself around him. Why are you walking like that? I don't want to constantly have to wash my paws. Did you ever think about how we walk on the same paws that we handle food with? You ever think about what we put into our mouths? All the time. When I eat, I don't want to taste everywhere my paws have been. Well, go ahead. But if Dad sees you walking like that, he's not going to like it. What have you got there? You found cheese? And not just any cheese. Tomme de chvre de pays! That would go beautifully with my mushroom. And... This rosemary! This rosemary with maybe with a few drops from this sweet grass. Well, throw it on the pile, I guess, and then we'll... You know... We don't want to throw this in with the garbage. This is special. But we're supposed to return to the colony before sundown or, you know, Dad's gonna... Emile! There are possibilities unexplored here. We got to cook this. Now, exactly how we cook this is the real question... Yeah. The key is to keep turning it. Get the smoky flavor nice and even. That storm's getting closer. Hey, Remy, you think that maybe we shouldn't be so... You got to taste this! This is... It's got this kind of... It's burny, melty... It's not really a smoky taste. It's a certain... It's kind of like a... It's got, like, this ""ba-boom, zap"" kind of taste. Don't you think? - What would you call that flavor? - Lightning-y? Yeah. It's lightning-y! We got to do that again. Okay, when the next storm comes, we'll go up on the roof... I know what this needs! Saffron! A little saffron would make this! Saffron. Why do I get the feeling - it's in the kitchen? - It's in the kitchen. Saffron. - Not good. Saffron. Don't like it. She's gonna wake up. I've been down here a million times. She turns on the cooking channel, boom, she never wakes up. You've been here a million times? I'm telling you, saffron will be just the thing. Gusteau swears by it. Okay. Who's Gusteau? Just the greatest chef in the world. Wrote this cookbook. Wait. You read? - Well, not excessively. - Oh, man. Does Dad know? You could fill a book, a lot of books, with things Dad doesn't know. And they have, which is why I read. Which is also our secret. I don't like secrets. All this cooking and reading and TV-watching while we read and cook. It's like you're involving me in crime, and I let you. Why do I let you? What's taking those kids so long? Ah, I'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh? Gusteau says it's excellent. Good thing the old lady is a food love... Forget mystique. This is about your cooking. Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look. Great cooking is not for the faint of heart. Great cooking is not for the faint of heart. You must be imaginative, strong hearted. You must try things that may not work. And you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from. Your only limit is your soul. What I say is true. Anyone can cook. But only the fearless can be great. Pure poetry. But it was not to last. Gusteau's restaurant lost one of its five stars after a scathing review by France's top food critic, Anton Ego. It was a severe blow to Gusteau, and the brokenhearted chef died shortly afterwards, which, according to tradition, meant the loss of another star. Gusteau is dead? Run! No, you'll lead her to the colony! - Help, Remy, help! - Emile! Start swinging the light! - Help, Remy, help! - Emile! Start swinging the light! Try to grab you. Emile, swing to me. Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats. Let me through! - The book. Let me through! - The book. Excuse me. Move, move. Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move. Get the bridge up! Move it, move it! Hey, Johnny! Hurry! Push off. Come on. Get hold! - Take the baby. Here! - Give me your paw. Hey, wait for me! Is everybody here? Do we have everybody? - Wait a minute. Where's Remy? - Right here. I'm coming. I'm coming! Hold on, Son. Give him something to grab on to. Come on, boy. Paddle, Son. Come on. Reach for it. You can do it. - Remy! - Dad! Come on. You can make it. You can make it. Guys, wait. Stop! Remy. Come on. Paddle. Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on. Dad? Dad? Which way? I waited for a sound, a voice, a sign, something. If you are hungry, go up and look around, Remy. Why do you wait and mope? Well, I've just lost my family, all my friends, probably forever. - How do you know? - Well, I... You are an illustration. Why am I talking to you? Well, you just lost your family, all your friends. You are lonely. Yeah. Well, you're dead. Ah, but that is no match for wishful thinking. If you focus on what you've left behind, you'll never be able to see what lies ahead. Now go up and look around. Champagne! What are you doing? I'm hungry. I don't know where I am, and I don't know when I'll find food again. Remy, you are better than that. You are a cook. A cook makes. A thief takes. You are not a thief. But I am hungry. Food will come, Remy. Food always comes to those who love to cook. - You think I am playing? - You don't have the guts. Paris? All this time I've been underneath Paris? Wow. It's beautiful. The most beautiful. Gusteau's? Your restaurant? You've led me to your restaurant. It seems as though I have. Yes. There it is! I have led you to it! I got to see this. Ready to go on table seven. Coming around. One order of steamed pike up. Coming up. I need more soup bowls, please. I need two rack of lamb. I need more leeks. I need two salmon, three salade compose, and three filet. Three orders of salade compose working. Firing two orders, seared salmon. Three filet working. I need plates. Fire seven. Three salade compose up. Don't mess with my mise! Open down low. I'm getting buried here. Hello, Chef Skinner. How your night be now? Bonjour, chef. Hello, Chef Skinner. - Evening, chef. Ordering deux filet. Hey, boss, look who is here. Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy. - Hi. - All grown up, eh? You remember Renata, Gusteau's old flame? - Yes. How are you... - Linguini. Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit. How is... - My mother? - Renata. - Yes, Renata. How is she? - Good. Well, not... She's been better. I mean... She died. I'm sorry. Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven, so she's covered. You know, afterlife-wise? - What's this? - She left it for you. I think she hoped it would help me, you know, get a job here. But of course. Gusteau wouldn't hesitate. Any son of Renata's is more than... Yes, well, we could file this and if something suitable opens up... We have already hired him. What? How dare you hire someone without my... We needed a garbage boy. Oh, garbage. Well... I'm glad it worked out. I can't believe it. A real gourmet kitchen, and I get to watch. You've read my book. Let us see how much you know, huh? Which one is the chef? - Oh, that guy. - Very good. Who is next in command? The sous chef. There. The sous is responsible for the kitchen when the chef's not around. Saucier, in charge of sauces. Very important. Chef de partie, demi chef de partie, both important. Commis, commis, they're cooks. Very important. You are a clever rat. Now, who is that? Oh, him? He's nobody. Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen. No, he's a plongeur or something. He washes dishes or takes out the garbage. He doesn't cook. - But he could. - Uh, no. How do you know? What do I always say? Anyone can cook. Well, yeah, anyone can. That doesn't mean that anyone should. Well, that is not stopping him. See? What is he doing? No. No! No, this is terrible! He's ruining the soup. And nobody's noticing? It's your restaurant. Do something. What can I do? I am a figment of your imagination. But he's ruining the soup! We got to tell someone that he's... But he's ruining the soup! We got to tell someone that he's... Table five coming up, right now. Coming down the line. Set. Hot! Open oven! Coming around. Oui, chef. One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck. Fire those souffls for table six, ja. Five minutes, chef. - Oh, God. Tonight, I'd like to present the foie gras. It has a wonderful finish. Ready to go on table seven. Come on! Let's go! Oui, chef. Remy! What are you waiting for? Is this going to become a regular thing with you? You know how to fix it. This is your chance. The soup! Where is the soup? Out of my way. Move it, garbage boy! You are cooking? How dare you cook in my kitchen? Where do you get the gall to even attempt something so monumentally idiotic? I should have you drawn and quartered! I'll do it. I think the law is on my side. Larousse, draw and quarter this man after you put him in the duck press to squeeze the fat out of his head. - What are you blathering about? - The soup! Soup? Stop that soup! No! Waiter. Linguini! You're fired! F- l-R-E-D! Fired! She wants to see the chef. But he... - What did the customer say? - It was not a customer. It was a critic. - Ego? - Solene LeClaire. - LeClaire? What did she say? - She likes the soup. - Wait. - What do you mean, ""Wait""? You're the reason I'm in this mess. Someone is asking about your soup. What are you playing at? Am I still fired? You can't fire him. - What? LeClaire likes it, yeah? She made a point of telling you so. If she write a review to that effect and find out you fired the cook responsible... - He's a garbage boy. - Who made something she liked. How can we claim to represent the name of Gusteau if we don't uphold his most cherished belief? And what belief is that, Mademoiselle Tatou? Anyone can cook. Perhaps I have been a bit harsh on our new garbage boy. He has taken a bold risk and we should reward that, as Chef Gusteau would have. If he wishes to swim in dangerous waters, who are we to deny him? - You were escaping? - Oh, yeah. Since you have expressed such an interest in his cooking career, you shall be responsible for it. Anyone else? Then back to work. You are either very lucky or very unlucky. You will make the soup again, and this time, I'll be paying attention. Very close attention. They think you might be a cook. But you know what I think, Linguini? I think you are a sneaky, overreaching little... Rat! - Rat! Get the rat. Linguini. Get something to trap it. It's getting away. Get it, get it, get it. - What should I do now? - Kill it. - Now? - No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad? Do you know what would happen to us if anyone knew we had a rat in our kitchen? They'd close us down. Our reputation is hanging by a thread as it is. Take it away from here. Far away. Kill it. Dispose of it. Go! Don't look at me like that! You aren't the only one who's trapped. They expect me to cook it again! I mean, I'm not ambitious. I wasn't trying to cook. I was just trying to stay out of trouble. You're the one who was getting fancy with the spices! What did you throw in there? Oregano? No? What? Rosemary? That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary? You didn't throw rosemary in there? Then what was all the flipping and all the throwing the... I need this job. I've lost so many. I don't know how to cook, and now I'm actually talking to a rat as if you... Did you nod? Have you been nodding? You understand me? So I'm not crazy! Wait a second, wait a second. I can't cook, can I? But you... You can, right? Look, don't be so modest. You're a rat, for Pete's sake. Whatever you did, they liked it. Yeah. This could work. Hey, they liked the soup! They liked the soup. Do you think you could do it again? Okay, I'm going to let you out now. But we're together on this. Right? Okay. So this is it. I mean, it's not much, but it's, you know... Not much. It could be worse. There's heat and light and a couch with a TV. So, you know, what's mine is yours. Are you... Is this a dream? The best kind of dream. One we can share. But why here? Why now? Why not here? Why not now? What better place to dream than in Paris? Morning, Little Chef. Rise and... Oh, no. Idiot! I knew this would happen! I let a rat into my place and tell him what's mine is his! Eggs, gone! Stupid! He's stolen food and hit the road! What did I expect? That's what I get for trusting a... Hi. Is that for me? That's good. What did you put in this? Where'd you get that? Look, it's delicious. But don't steal. I'll buy some spices, okay? Oh, no. We're going to be late. And on the first day! Come on, Little Chef! ""Though I, like many other critic, ""had written off Gusteau as irrelevant since the great chef's death, ""the soup was a revelation. A spicy yet subtle taste experience."" - Solene LeClaire? - Yes! ""Against all odds, Gusteau's has recaptured our attention. ""Only time will tell if they deserve it."" Well... You know. Look, I know it's stupid and weird, but neither of us can do this alone, so we got to do it together, right? You with me? So let's do this thing! I... Welcome to hell. Now, recreate the soup. Take as much time as you need. All week if you must. Soup. You little... Ow! You son of a... You got... This is not going to work, Little Chef! I'm going to lose it if we do this anymore. We've got to figure out something else. Something that doesn't involve any biting, or nipping, or running up and down my body with your little rat feet. The biting! No! Scampering! No! No scampering or scurrying. Understand, Little Chef? Little Chef? Oh, you're hungry. Okay. So let's think this out. You know how to cook, and I know how to appear human. We need to work out a system so that I do what you want in a way that doesn't look like I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef. Would you listen to me? I'm insane! I'm insane! I'm insane! In a refrigerator talking to a rat about cooking in a gourmet restaurant. - I will never pull this off! - Linguini? We gotta communicate. I can't be constantly checking for a yes or no head shake from a... The rat! I saw it! - A rat? - Yes, a rat. Right next to you. What are you doing in here? I'm just familiarizing myself with, you know, the vegetables and such. Get out. One can get too familiar with vegetables, you know! That was close. Are you okay up there? How did you do that? That's strangely involuntary! One look and I knew we had the same crazy idea. Okay. Where are you taking me? Wait. Wait. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay.  votre sant! All right. That should do it. Congratulations. You were able to repeat your accidental success. But you'll need to know more than soup if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy. Colette will be responsible for teaching you how we do things here. Listen, I just want you to know how honored I am to be studying under such... No! You listen. I just want you to know exactly who you are dealing with. How many women do you see in this kitchen? Well, I... - Only me. Why do you think that is? - Well, I... Because haute cuisine is an antiquated hierarchy built upon rules written by stupid old men. Rules designed to make it impossible for women to enter this world. But still I'm here. How did this happen? Because, well, because you... Because I am the toughest cook in this kitchen. I've worked too hard for too long to get here and I am not going to jeopardize it for some garbage boy who got lucky. Got it? Easy to cook. Easy to eat. Gusteau makes Chinese food Chine-easy. - Excellent work, Franois, as usual. - It's good, isn't it? I want you to work up something for my latest frozen food concept. Gusteau's Corn Puppies. They're like corn dogs, only smaller. Bite size. What are corn dogs? Cheap sausages dipped in batter and deep fried. You know, American. Cheap sausages dipped in batter and deep fried. You know, American. Whip something up. Maybe Gusteau in overalls and Huckleberry Tom hat. Or as a big ear of corn in doggie make-up. Yes. But, please, with dignity. Get my lawyer! Well, the will stipulates that if after a period of two years from the date of death no heir appears, Gusteau's business interests will pass to his sous chef. You. I know what the will stipulates. What I want to know is if this letter... If this boy changes anything! There's not much resemblance. There's no resemblance at all. He is not Gusteau's son. Gusteau had no children, and what of the timing of all this? The deadline in the will expires in less than a month! Suddenly, some boy arrives with a letter from his recently deceased mother claiming Gusteau is his father? Highly suspect! - This is Gusteau's? - Yes, yes, yes. - May I? - Of course. But the boy does not know. She claims she never told him, or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell. - Why you? What does she want? - A job for the boy. - Only a job? - Well, yes. Then what are you worried about? If he works here, you'll be able to keep an eye on him while I do a little digging. Find out how much of this is real. I will need you to collect some DNA samples from the boy. Hair, maybe. Mark my words. The whole thing is highly suspect. He knows something. Relax, he's a garbage boy. I think you can handle him. What are you doing? I'm cutting vegetables. I'm cutting vegetables? No! You waste energy and time! You think cooking is a cute job, like Mommy in the kitchen? Well, Mommy never had to face the dinner rush when the orders come flooding in, and every dish is different and none are simple, and all of the different cooking times, but must arrive on the customer's table at exactly the same time, hot and perfect! Every second counts, and you cannot be Mommy! What is this? Keep your station clear! When the meal rush comes, what will happen? Messy stations slow things down. Food doesn't go, orders pile up. Disaster. I'll make this easy to remember. Keep your station clear, or I will kill you! Your sleeves look like you threw up on them. Keep your hands and arms in, close to the body. Like this. See? Always return to this position. Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils, hot metal, keep your arms in. You will minimize cuts and burns and keep your sleeves clean. Mark of a chef: Messy apron, clean sleeves. I know the Gusteau style cold. In every dish, Chef Gusteau always has something unexpected. I will show you. I memorize all his recipe. - Always do something unexpected. - No. Follow the recipe. - But you just said that... - No, no, no. It was his job to be unexpected. It is our job to... - Follow his recipes. - Follow the recipe. How do you tell how good bread is without tasting it? Not the smell, not the look, but the sound of the crust. Listen. Symphony of crackle. Only great bread sound this way. The only way to get the best produce is to have first pick of the day and there are only two way to get first pick. Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower. Voil! The best restaurant get first pick. People think haute cuisine is snooty. So chef must also be snooty. But not so. Lalo there ran away from home at 12. Got hired by circus people as an acrobat. And then he get fired for messing around with the ringmaster's daughter. Horst has done time. What for? No one know for sure. He changes the story every time you ask him. I defrauded a major corporation. I robbed the second largest bank in France using only a ballpoint pen. I created a hole in the ozone over Avignon. I killed a man with this thumb. Don't ever play cards with Pompidou. He's been banned from Las Vegas and Monte Carlo. - Larousse ran gun for the Resistance. - Which resistance? He won't say. Apparently, they didn't win. So you see. We are artist, pirate. More than cooks are we. - We? - Oui. You are one of us now, oui? Oui. Thank you, by the way, for all the advice about cooking. - Thank you, too. - For what? For taking it. The rat! - But he is a... - I just dropped my keys. Have you decided this evening? - Your soup is excellent. But... - But we order it every time. - What else do you have? - Well, we have a very nice foie gras. I know about the foie gras. The old standby, used to be famous for it. What does the chef have that's new? - Someone has asked what is new! - New? Yes. What do I tell them? - Well, what did you tell them? - I told them I would ask! What are you blathering about? - Customers are asking what is new. - What should I tell them? - What did you tell them? - I told them I would ask! This is simple. Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe, something we haven't made in a while... They know about the old stuff. They like Linguini's soup. They are asking for food from Linguini? A lot of customers like the soup. That's all we are saying. Were we saying that? Very well. If it's Linguini they want tell them Chef Linguini has prepared something special for them. Something definitely off menu. Oh, and don't forget to stress - its Linguini-ness. - Oui, chef. Now is your chance to try something worthy of your talent, Linguini. A forgotten favorite of the chef's, sweetbread  la Gusteau. - Colette will help you. - Oui, chef. Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry. Are you sure? That recipe was a disaster. Gusteau himself said so. Just the sort of challenge a budding chef needs. ""Sweetbread  la Gusteau. ""Sweetbread cooked in a seaweed salt crust ""with cuttlefish tentacle, dog rose pure, ""geoduck egg, dried white fungus? ""Anchovy licorice sauce."" I don't know this recipe, but it's Gusteau's, so... Lalo! We have some veal stomach soaking, yes? Yes! The veal stomach, I get that. Veal stomach? Okay. I'll be right back. Where... Hey, I got to... Hey! Don't mind me. I just need to borrow this real quick. Let's see, over here... I'll be back. Thank you. Excuse me. I'm going to... Apparently, I need this. I'll be right... I'm going to pick that up. I got some of that spice. Okay. What are you doing? You're supposed to be preparing the Gusteau recipe. This is the recipe. The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else have you... You are improvising? This is no time to experiment. The customer are waiting. You're right. I should listen to you! - Stop that! - Stop what? Freaking me out! Whatever you are doing, stop it. Where is the special order? - Coming! - I thought we were together on this. - We are together. - Then what are you doing? - It's very hard to explain. - The special? - Come get it! I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce. - Don't you dare. - I'm not, I'm not. I'm... Sorry. Is Linguini's dish done yet? Ja. It's as bad as we remember. Just went out. - Did you taste it? - Ja, of course, before he changed it. Good. What? How could he change it? He changed it as it was going out the door! Ow! They love it! Other diners are already asking about it, about Linguini. I have seven more orders! That's wonderful. I'd like one of those. Special order! What is that? Special order! Special order! Special order! To Linguini. - Congratulations, Mr. Linguini. - Cheers, ja? Drink now, there's plenty. Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air. We really did it tonight. Dah! Got your toque! Oh, seriously now. I'd love to have a little talk with you, Linguini, in my office. - Am I in trouble? - Trouble? No. A little wine, a friendly chat. Just us cooks. The plongeur won't be coming to you for advice anymore, eh, Colette? He's gotten all he needs. Toasting your success, eh, Linguini? Good for you. I just took it to be polite. I don't really drink, you know. Of course you don't. I wouldn't either if I was drinking that. But you would have to be an idiot of elephantine proportions not to appreciate this '61 Chteau Latour. And you, Monsieur Linguini, are no idiot. Let us toast your non-idiocy. - Remy! - Emile? I can't believe it! You're alive! - You made it! - I thought I'd never see you guys again! We figured you didn't survive the rapids. And what are you eating? I don't really know. I think it was some sort of wrapper once. What? No. You're in Paris now, baby. My town. No brother of mine eats rejectamenta in my town. Remy! You are stealing? You told Linguini he could trust you. - And he can. It's for my brother. - But the boy could lose his job. Which means I would, too. It's under control, okay? - More wine? - I shouldn't, but... Okay. So, where did you train, Linguini? Train? All right. Surely you don't expect me to believe this is your first time cooking? - It's not. - I knew it! It's my... Second, third, fourth... Fifth time. Monday was my first time. But I've taken out the garbage lots of times before that... Yes, yes. Have some more wine. Tell me, Linguini, about your interests. Do you like animals? What? Animals? What kind? The usual, dogs, cats, horses, guinea pigs, rats. I brought you something to... No, no, no, no! Spit that out right now! I have got to teach you about food. Close your eyes. Now take a bite of... No! No! No! - Don't just hork it down! - Too late. Here. Chew it slowly. Only think about the taste. - See? - Not really. Creamy, salty sweet, an oaky nuttiness. - You detect that? - Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness. Close your eyes. Now taste this. Whole different thing, right? Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish. - Okay. - Now, try them together. Okay. I think I'm getting a little something there. - It might be the nuttiness. - See? - Could be the tang. - That's it. Now, imagine every great taste in the world being combined into infinite combinations. Tastes that no one has tried yet! Discoveries to be made! I think... - You lost me again. - Yeah. But that was interesting. Most interesting garbage I ever... Hey! What are we doing? Dad doesn't know you're alive yet! We've got to go to the colony! Everyone will be thrilled! - Yeah! But... - What? Thing is, I kind of have to... What do you ""have to"" more than family? What's more important here? Well, I... It wouldn't hurt to visit. - Have you had a pet rat? - No. - Did you work in a lab with rats? - No. Perhaps you lived in squalor at some point? Nopety nopety no. You know something about rats! You know you do! You know who know do whacka-doo. Ratta-tatta. - Hey! Why do they call it that? - What? Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right? Why do they call it that? If you're going to name a food, you should give it a name that sounds delicious. Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious. It sounds like ""rat"" and ""patootie."" Rat patootie. Which does not sound delicious. Regrettably we are all out of wine. My son has returned! And finding someone to replace you for poison checker has been a disaster. Nothing's been poisoned, thank God, but it hasn't been easy. - You didn't make it easy. - I know. I am sorry, Dad. Well, the important thing is that you're home. Yeah, well, about that... You look thin. Why is that? A shortage of food, or a surplus of snobbery? It's tough out there in the big world all alone, isn't it? Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore. - Hey. Hey, boy. What's up? - I can take care of myself. I've found a nice spot not far away, so I'll be able to visit often. Nothing like a cold splash of reality to make you... - Visit? - I will. I promise. Often. - You're not staying? - No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just... You didn't think I was going to stay forever, did you? Eventually, a bird's got to leave the nest. We're not birds. We're rats. We don't leave our nests. We make them bigger. - Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat. - Maybe you're not a rat at all. Maybe that's a good thing. Hey! The band's really on tonight, huh? Rats. All we do is take, Dad. I'm tired of taking. I want to make things. I want to add something to this world. - You're talking like a human. - Who are not as bad as you say. - Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure? - Oh, man. I've been able to observe them at a close-ish sort of range. - Yeah? How close? - Close enough. And they're, you know, not so bad as you say they are. Come with me. I got something I want you to see. You know, I'm going to stay here. Make sure the floors and countertops are clean before you lock up. Wait. You want me to stay and clean? Is that a problem? - No. - Good boy. See you tomorrow. We're here. Take a good long look, Remy. Now, this is what happens when a rat gets a little too comfortable around humans. The world we live in belongs to the enemy. We must live carefully. We look out for our own kind, Remy. When all is said and done, we're all we've got. - No. - What? No. Dad, I don't believe it. You're telling me that the future is... Can only be more of this? This is the way things are. You can't change nature. Change is nature, Dad. The part that we can influence. And it starts when we decide. - Where you going? - With luck, forward. Hey! Yeah. Stop it. Good morning. Good morning. So, the chef, he invited you in for a drink? That's big. That's big. What did he say? What? What, you can't tell me? Forgive me for intruding on your deep, personal relationship with the chef. Oh, I see how it is. You get me to teach you a few kitchen tricks to dazzle the boss and then you blow past me? Wake up. Wake up. I thought you were different. I thought you thought I was different. I thought... I didn't have to help you! If I looked out only for myself, I would have let you drown! But... I wanted you to succeed. I liked you. My mistake. Colette. Wait, wait. Colette! It's over, Little Chef. I can't do it anymore. Colette! Wait, wait! Don't motorcycle away. Look, I'm no good with words. I'm no good with food either. At least not without your help. I hate false modesty. It's just another way to lie. - You have talent. - No, but I don't! Really! It's not me. When I added that extra ingredient instead of following the recipe like you said, That wasn't me either. - What do you mean? - I mean, I wouldn't have done that. I would've followed the recipe. I would've followed your advice. I would've followed your advice to the ends of the earth. - Because I love your advice. - But... But I... Don't do it. I have a secret. It's sort of disturbing. - I have a... - What? You... - I have a ra... - You have a rash? No, no, no. I have this... This tiny little... Little... A tiny chef who tells me what to do. A tiny chef? Yes. Yes. He's... - He's up here. - In your brain? Why is it so hard to talk to you? Okay. Here we go. You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all. I'm going to risk looking like the biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen. You want to know why I'm such a fast learner? You want to know why I'm such a great cook? Don't laugh! I'm going to show you! No! No! - What is it, Ambrister? - Gusteau's. - Finally closing, is it? - No. - More financial trouble? - No, it's... Announced a new line of microwave egg rolls? What? What? Spit it out. It's come back. It's popular. - I haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years. - No, sir. My last review condemned it - to the tourist trade. - Yes, sir. I said, ""Gusteau has finally found his rightful place in history ""right alongside another equally famous chef, ""Monsieur Boyardee."" Touch. That is where I left it. That was my last word. - The last word. - Yes. Then tell me, Ambrister, how could it be popular? No, no, no, no, no, no, no! The DNA matches, the timing works, everything checks out. He is Gusteau's son. This can't just happen! The whole thing is a setup! The boy knows! Look at him out there, pretending to be an idiot. He's toying with my mind like a cat with a ball of... Something. - String? - Yes! Playing dumb. - Taunting me with that rat. - Rat? Yes. He's consorting with it. Deliberately trying to make me think it's important. - The rat. - Exactly! Is the rat important? Of course not! He just wants me to think that it is. Oh, I see the theatricality of it. A rat appears on the boy's first night, I order him to kill it. And now he wants me to see it everywhere. It's here! No, it isn't, it's here! Am I seeing things, am I crazy? Is there a phantom rat or is there not? But, oh, no! I refuse to be sucked into his little game of... Should I be concerned about this? About you? I can't fire him. He's getting attention. If I fire him now, everyone will wonder why. And the last thing I want is people looking into this. What are you so worried about? Isn't it good to have the press? Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name getting headlines? Not if they're over his face! Gusteau's already has a face, and it's fat and lovable and familiar. And it sells burritos! Millions and millions of burritos! The deadline passes in three days. Then you can fire him whenever he ceases to be valuable and no one will ever know. I was worried about the hair sample you gave me. - I had to send them back to the lab. - Why? Because the first time it came back identified as rodent hair. - No, no, no. - What? Try this. It's better. Well, because you... Rat! Disgusting little creatures. I was reminded how fragile it all was. How the world really saw me. And it just kept getting better. Remy! Remy! Psst! Psst! Hey, hey, hey, little brother! We were afraid you weren't going to, you know, show up. - Hey, Remy! How you doing? - You told them? Emile, that's exactly what I said not to do! But you know these guys. They're my friends. I didn't think you meant them. Look, I'm sorry. Don't tell me you're sorry, tell them you're sorry. - Is there a problem over here? - No, there is not. Wait here. It's locked? Remy, what are you doing in here? Okay. Emile shows up with... Okay, I said not to. I told him... He goes and blabs to... Yeah, it's a disaster. Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe is locked and I need the key. - They want you to steal food? - Yes. No! It's... - They want you to steal food? - Yes. No! It's... It's complicated. It's family. They don't have your ideals. Ideals? If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals, you think I'd be hawking barbecue over here? Or microwave burritos? Or, Tooth, I say, Tooth Pick'n Chicken? About as French as a corn dog! Coming soon! We're inventing new ways to sell out over here. Will ye be wanting some haggis bites? I cannot control how they use my image, Remy. - I am dead! - Can you guys shut up? I've got to think! Word's getting out. If I can't keep them quiet, the entire clan's gonna be after me with their mouths open and... Here it is. Hey. Your will! - Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I... - Not at all. Linguini? Why would Linguini be filed with your will? This used to be my office. He's your son? - I have a son? - How could you not know this? I am a figment of your imagination. You did not know, how could I? Well, your son is the rightful owner of this restaurant! Well, your son is the rightful owner of this restaurant! No! No! The rat! - Sorry, chef. - The rat! It's stolen my documents! - It's getting away! Hey, Mr. Chef! You! - Get out of my office. - He's not in your office. You are in his. Bottoms up, Linguini!  Cheers, ja. Chef! Chef! Chef Linguini! Your rise has been meteoric, yet you have no formal training. What is the secret to your genius? Secret? You want the truth? I am Gusteau's son. It's in my blood I guess. But you weren't aware of that fact until very recently. No. And it resulted in your taking ownership of this restaurant. How did you find out? Well, some part of me just knew. The Gusteau part? - Where do you get your inspiration? - Inspiration has many names. - Mine is named Colette. - What? Something's stuck in my teeth. Health Inspector. I wish to report a rat infestation. It's taken over my... Gusteau's restaurant. Gusteau's, eh? I can drop by. Let's see. First opening is three months. It must happen now! It's a gourmet restaurant! Monsieur, I have the information. If someone cancels, I'll slot you in. But the rat! You must... It stole my documents. It's past opening time. He should have finished an hour ago. Bonjour, ma chrie. Join us. We were just talking about my inspiration. Yes, he calls it his tiny chef. Not that, dearest. I meant you. - It's him. - Ego? Anton Ego! Is that Ego? I can't believe it. - You are Monsieur Linguini? - Hello. Pardon me for interrupting your premature celebration, but I thought it only fair to give you a sporting chance as you are new to this game. - Game? - Yes. And you've been playing without an opponent. Which is, as you may have guessed, against the rules. You're Anton Ego. You're slow for someone in the fast lane. And you're thin for someone who likes food. I don't like food. I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow. I will return tomorrow night with high expectations. Pray you don't disappoint me. Listen, we hate to be rude, but we're French, and it's dinnertime. She meant to say, ""It's dinnertime and we're French."" Don't give me that look. You were distracting me in front of the press. How am I supposed to concentrate with you yanking on my hair all the time? And that's another thing. Your opinion isn't the only one that matters here. Colette knows how to cook, too, you know. All right, that's it! You take a break, Little Chef. I'm not your puppet, and you're not my puppet-controlling guy! The rat is the cook. You cool off and get your mind right, Little Chef. You cool off and get your mind right, Little Chef. Ego is coming, and I need to focus! You stupid... Wow. I have never seen that before. Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny or something. I'm sorry, Remy. I know there are too many guys. - I tried to limit... - You know what? It's okay. I've been selfish. - You guys hungry? - Are you kidding? All right. Dinner's on me. We'll go after closing time. - In fact... - Yeah. ...tell Dad to bring the whole clan. Little Chef? This is great, Son. An inside job. I see the appeal. Oof! Little Chef? Little Chef? Hey, Little Chef. I thought you went back to the apartment. Then when you weren't there, I don't know... It didn't seem right to leave things the way that we did, so... Look, I don't want to fight. I've been under a lot of, you know, pressure. A lot has changed in not very much time, you know? I'm suddenly a Gusteau. And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know, people will be disappointed. It's weird. You know, I've never disappointed anyone before, because nobody's ever expected anything of me. And the only reason anyone expects anything from me now is because of you. I haven't been fair to you. You've never failed me, and I should never forget that. You've been a good friend. The most honorable friend a guy could ever ask... What is this? What's going on? What... Hey... You're... You're stealing food? How could you? I thought you were my friend! I trusted you! Get out! You and all your rat buddies! And don't come back or I'll treat you the way restaurants are supposed to treat pests! You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding? We are what we are, and we're rats. Well, he'll leave soon, and now you know how to get in. Steal all you want. - You're not coming? - I've lost my appetite. Do you know what you would like this evening, sir? Yes, I'd like your heart roasted on a spit. Come in! Today's the big day. You should say something to them. - Like what? - You are the boss. Inspire them. Attention. Attention, everyone. Tonight is a big night. Appetite is coming, and he's going to have a big ego. I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic. And he's going to order something. Something from our menu. And we'll have to cook it, unless he orders something cold. Just can't leave it alone, can you? You really shouldn't be here during restaurant hours. It's not safe. I'm hungry! And I don't need the inside food to be happy. The key, my friend, is to not be picky. - Observe. - No, wait! - Oh, no! No, no! What do we do? - I'll go get Dad. You might think you are a chef but you are still only a rat. Sure he took away a star last time he reviewed this place. Sure it probably killed... Dad. - This is very bad juju right here. - But I'll tell you one thing... - Ego is here. - Ego? He is here? Anton Ego is just another customer. Let's cook! Yeah! Let's... Okay. So I have in mind a simple arrangement. You will create for me a new line of Chef Skinner frozen foods. And I, in return, will not kill you. Au revoir, rat! Do you know what you would like this evening, sir? Yes, I think I do. After reading a lot of overheated puffery about your new cook, you know what I'm craving? A little perspective. That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear, well seasoned perspective. Can you suggest a good wine to go with that? - With what, sir? - Perspective. Fresh out, I take it? I am... Very well. Since you're all out of perspective and no one else seems to have it in this bloody town, I'll make you a deal. You provide the food, I'll provide the perspective. Which would go nicely with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947. I'm afraid I... Your dinner selection? Tell your Chef Linguini that I want whatever he dares to serve me. Tell him to hit me with his best shot. I will have whatever he is having. - So, we have given up. - Why do you say that? We are in a cage inside the car trunk awaiting a future in frozen food products. No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up. You are free. I am only as free as you imagine me to be. As you are. Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending. I pretend to be a rat for my father. I pretend to be a human through Linguini. I pretend you exist so I have someone to talk to! You only tell me stuff I already know! I know who I am! Why do I need you to tell me? Why do I need to pretend? But you don't, Remy. You never did. No. My other left! Dad? Dad, I'm in here! I'm inside the trunk! What the... Dad! - Hey, little brother! - Emile! I love you guys! Where are you going? Back to the restaurant. They'll fail without me. - Why do you care? - Because I'm a cook! It's your recipe. How can you not know your own recipe? I didn't write it down. It just came to me. Then make it come to you again, ja? Because we can't serve this! Where's my order? Can't we serve something else? Something I didn't invent? This is what they're ordering. Make them order something else. Tell them we're all out. We cannot be all out. We just opened. I have another idea. What if we serve them what they order! We will make it. Just tell us what you did. I don't know what I did. We need to tell the customers something. Then tell them... Tell them... - Don't do it. - Remy. Remy. Don't! Stop! They'll see you. Stop. We're not talking about me. We're talking about what to do right... Rats! - Remy! - Get my knife. Don't touch him! Thanks for coming back, Little Chef. I know this sounds insane, but... Well, the truth sounds insane sometimes. But that doesn't mean it's not the truth. And the truth is, I have no talent at all. But this rat, he's the one behind these recipes. He's the cook. The real cook. He's been hiding under my toque. He's been controlling my actions. He's the reason I can cook the food that's exciting everyone. The reason Ego is outside that door. You've been giving me credit for his gift. I know it's a hard thing to believe. But, hey, you believed I could cook, right? Look, this works. It's crazy, but it works. We can be the greatest restaurant in Paris, and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef, can lead us there. What do you say? You with me? Dad. Dad, I don't know what to say. I was wrong about your friend and about you. I don't want you to think I'm choosing this over family. I can't choose between two halves of myself. I'm not talking about cooking. I'm talking about guts. This really means that much to you? We're not cooks, but we are family. You tell us what to do, and we'll get it done. - Stop that health inspector! - Delta Team, go, go, go, go! The rest of you stay and help Remy. Team three will be handling fish. Team four, roasted items. Team three will be handling fish. Team four, roasted items. Team five, grill. Team six, sauces. Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go! Those handling food will walk on two legs. We need someone to wait tables. I'm sorry for any delay, but we're a little short tonight. Please, take all of the time you need. He came in late one more time and all of a sudden he... Make sure that steak is nice and tenderized. Work it. Yeah. Stick and move. Stick and move. Easy with that sole meunire. Less salt. More butter. Only use the mimolette cheese. Whoa! Compose the salad like you were painting a picture. Not too much vinaigrette on that salade compose. Don't let that beurre blanc separate. Keep whisking. Gently poach the scallops. Taste check. Spoons down. Good. Too much salt. Good. Don't boil the consomm, it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile! Sorry. Colette, wait! Colette. - You came back. Colette... - Don't say a word. If I think about it, I might change my mind. Just tell me what the rat wants to cook. Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish. Are you sure you want to serve this to Ego? What? I am making ratatouille. Well, how would you prepare it? Ratatouille? They must be joking. No, it can't be. Who cooked the ratatouille? I demand to know! I can't remember the last time I asked a waiter to give my compliments to the chef. And now I find myself in the extraordinary position of having my waiter be the chef. Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight. Then who do I thank for the meal? Excuse me a minute. You must be the chef... If you wish to meet the chef, you will have to wait until all the other customer have gone. So be it. At first, Ego thinks it's a joke. But as Linguini explains, Ego's smile disappears. He doesn't react beyond asking an occasional question. And when the story is done, Ego stands, thanks us for the meal... Thank you for the meal. ... and leaves without another word. The following day his review appears. In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new, an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto, ""Anyone can cook."" But I realize only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more. I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more. It was a great night.  The happiest of my life. But the only thing predictable about life is its unpredictability. Well, we had to let Skinner and the health inspector loose, and of course they ratted us out. The food didn't matter. Once it got out there were rats in the kitchen, oh, man, the restaurant was closed and Ego lost his job and his credibility. But don't feel too bad for him. He's doing very well as a small business investor. - He seems very happy. - How do you know?  Got to go. Dinner rush. You know how he likes it. Thanks, Little Chef. Can I interest you in a dessert this evening? - Don't you always? - Which one would you like? Surprise me. Can I interest you in a dessert this evening? Hey, believe me, that story gets better when I tell it, okay? Come on. Bring some food over here, we're starving!, Will! - Why is this happening? - I don't know. You look beautiful. And it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding. Make way! Let me through! How dare you! Stand your men down at once. Do you hear me? Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been too long. - Cutler Beckett? - It's Lord now, actually. Lord or not, you have no reason and no authority to arrest this man. In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer? The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner. - This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann. - Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake. - Arrest her. - On what charges? - No! - Aha. Here's the one for William Turner. And I have another one for a Mr. James Norrington. - Is he present? - What are the charges? Commodore Norrington resigned his commission some months ago. I don't believe that was the answer to the question I asked. Lord Beckett. In the category of questions not answered... We are under the jurisdiction of the king's governor of Port Royal and you will tell us what we are charged with. The charge is ""conspiring to set free a man convicted of crimes against the Crown and Empire and condemned to death, for which the..."" For which the punishment, regrettably, is also death. Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow. Captain. Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought you might. (man) # Fifteen men on a dead man's chest # Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum # Drink and the devil had done for the rest # Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum (laughs) (bell tolls) Prisoners, come on! (groaning) (screams) (screams) Sorry, mate. Mind if we make a little side trip? I don't think so. - Not quite according to plan. - Complications arose, ensued, were overcome. - You got what you went in for, then? - Mm-hm. Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well, were expecting something a bit more... shiny, with the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped, reclaimed by the sea with the treasure. And the Royal Navy chasing us around the Atlantic. - And the hurricane. - (all) Aye. All in all, it seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating. - Shiny. - Aye, shiny. Is that how you're all feeling? That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain? (squawks) Walk the plank. - What did the bird say? - Do not blame the bird. Show us what is on that piece of cloth there. - You know that don't do no good. - (Jack) It does me. - It's a key. - No. Much more better. It is a drawing of a key. Gentlemen, What do keys do? Keys... Unlock things? And whatever this key unlocks, inside there's something valuable. So we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks. No. If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it? So we're going after this key. You're not making any sense at all. Any more questions? So... do we have a heading? Ha! A heading. Set sail in a... general... that-way direction. Captain? Come on, snap to and make sail. You know how this works. Go on. Oi, oi, oi! Have you noticed lately, the captain seems to be acting a bit strange... er? Setting sail without knowing his own heading. Something's got Jack vexed, and mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all. (Man) Lord Beckett, the prisoner as ordered, sir. Those won't be necessary. The East India Trading Company has need of your services. We wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow. More acquaintance. How do you know him? (Beckett) We've had dealings in the past. And we've each left our mark on the other. What mark did he leave on you? By your efforts, Jack Sparrow was set free. I would like you to go to him and recover a certain property in his possession. Recover. At the point of a sword? Bargain. Letters of marque. You will offer what amounts to a full pardon. Jack will be free, a privateer in the employ of England. Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free. Freedom. Jack Sparrow is a dying breed. The world is shrinking, the blank edges of the map filled in. Jack must find his place in the New World or perish. Not unlike you, Mr. Turner. You and your fiance face the hangman's noose. - So you get Jack and the Black Pearl. - The Black Pearl? - The property you want that he possesses. - A ship? Hardly. The item in question is considerably smaller and far more valuable, something Sparrow keeps on his person at all times. A compass? Ah, you know it. Bring back that compass or there's no deal. Why is the rum always gone? Oh. That's why. (snoring) As you were, gents. Ah. (man) Time's run out, Jack. Bootstrap. Bill Turner. You look good, Jack. Is this a dream? No. I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum. You got the Pearl back, I see. I had some help retrieving the Pearl,by the way. Your son. William? He ended up a pirate after all. And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle? He sent me. Davy Jones. Oh. So it's you, then. He shanghaied you into service, eh? I chose it. I'm sorry for the part I played in the mutiny against you, Jack. I stood up for you. Everything went wrong after that. They strapped me to a cannon. I ended up on the bottom of the ocean, the weight of the water crushing down on me. Unable to move. Unable to die, Jack. And I thought that even the tiniest hope of escaping this fate, I would take it. I would trade anything for it. It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment. You made a deal with him too, Jack. He raised the Pearl from the depths for you. 13 years, you've been her captain. - Technically... - Jack. You won't be able to talk yourself out of this. The terms what applied to me apply to you as well. One soul bound to crew 100 years upon his ship. Yes, with the Flying Dutchman already has a captain... Then it's the locker for you! Jones's terrible leviathan will find you and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it. Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie? I already told you, Jack. Your time is up. It comes now, drawn with ravenous hunger to the man what bears the black spot. On deck, all hands! Make fast the bunt gasket! On deck! Scurry! Scurry! I want movement! Movement! I want movement! Lift the skin up! Keep your loof! Haul those sheets! Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us! - Do we have a heading? - Argh! Run! Land. - Which port? - I didn't say ""port"", I said ""land"". Any land. - Jack's hat! Bring her about! - (Jack) No, no! Leave it! Run. Back to your stations, the lot of you! - Jack? - Shh. For the love of mother and child, Jack, what's coming after us? Nothing. (laughs) (speaks Turkish) (creaking) - Here, now, you can't be here. - I think you'll find he can. (guard) Mr. Swann! Governor Swann, still. Do you think I wear this wig to keep my head warm? Jack's compass? What does Beckett want with that? Does it matter? I'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal. In exchange, the charges against us will be dropped. No. We must find our own avenue to secure your freedom. Is that a lack of faith in Jack or in me? That you would risk your life to save Sparrow does not mean he would do the same for anyone else. Now, where is that dog with the keys? (whistles) I have faith in you. Both of you. Where will you find him? Tortuga. I'll start there and I won't stop searching till I find him. And then I intend to return here to marry you. - Properly? - Eagerly, if you'll still have me. If it weren't for these bars, I'd have you already. - I'll wait for you. - Keep a weather eye on the horizon. Captain Jack Sparrow? Owes me four doubloons. Heard he was dead. Singapore. That's what I heard. Drunk, with a smile on his face. Sure as the tide, Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore. Jack Sparrow? I haven't seen him in a month. When you find him, will you give him a message? Can't say about Jack Sparrow, but there's an island just south of the straits where I trade spice for... mm, delicious long pork. Cannot say about Jack, but you'll find a ship there. A ship with black sails. My brother will take you ashore. - What's wrong? The beach is there. - C'est trop dangereux. - What? - C'est trop dangereux, je vous l'avais dit. Bon voyage, monsieur. Jack! Jack Sparrow! Marty! Cotton! Anybody? - Ah! A familiar face. - (squawks) Don't eat me. - I'm not going to eat you. - Don't eat me. No. Don't eat me. (squawks) Gibbs. (shouts) Come on! Let's go! Come on! Who wants it? I can do this all day! (speaks native language) Jack? Jack Sparrow! I can honestly say I'm glad to see you. Jack, it's me. Will Turner. (speaks cannibals' language) - Tell them to let me down! - (Cannibals' language) ...eensy-weensy. ...eunuchy. Snip, snip. - (cannibals murmur) Eunuchy. - (Will) Jack, the compass. That's all I need. Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for helping you. She faces the gallows! (cannibals' language) Savvy? (Cannibals' language) Save me. Jack, what did you tell them? No! What about Elizabeth? Jack! (whistles) That's a good girl. Come a little closer. - We don't bite. - Go on. We won't bite you. Come quickly. - Tell me what's happening. - Our name still has some standing. I've arranged passage to England. The captain is a friend of mine. No! Will's gone to find Jack! We cannot count on William Turner. - Come! - He's better than you give him credit for. This is no time for innocence. Beckett has offered one pardon only - one, and that is promised to Jack Sparrow. Even if Will succeeds, do not ask me to endure the sight of my daughter walking to the gallows. Do not. Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial for Will if he returns. - A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging. - Then there is nothing left for you here. Whoa! Wait inside. Captain? Captain. (gasps) Evening, Governor. Shame, that. He was carrying this. It's a letter to the king. - It's from you. - No... Elizabeth. What are you doing? - Where is she? - Who? (groans) No doubt you've discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm, as your father believes. Then what is? I'm afraid currency is the currency of the realm. I expect, then, we can come to some sort of understanding. - I'm here to negotiate. - I'm listening. I'm listening intently. These letters of marque are signed by the king. Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal. Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the compass owned by Jack Sparrow. - It will do you no good. - Do explain. I have been to the Isla de Muerta. I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know. Ah, I see. You think the compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta and so you hope to save me from an evil fate. But you mustn't worry. I care not for cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not so provincial. There's more than one chest of value in these waters. So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer. (cocks gun) Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night. So I did. A marriage interrupted... or fate intervenes? You're making great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom. - These aren't going to Jack. - Oh, really? To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom, then, I'll still want that compass. Consider that in your calculations. I say it was Divine Providence what escaped us from jail. And I say it was me being clever. Ain't that right, poochie? Well, how'd you know it weren't Divine Providence what inspired you to be clever? Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship. It ain't stealing. It's salvaging. And since when did you care? Since we're not immortal no more. We gotta take care of our immortal souls. - You know you can't read. - It's the Bible. You get credit for trying. Pretending to read the Bible's a lie. That's a mark against... (barking) Look. There it is. What's got into him? Must have seen a catfish. (laughs) Stupid mongrel! (Pirates argue) Argh! Come on! (gleeful laughter) - It's ours for the taking. - Tide's coming in. That should help. And salvaging is saving, in a manner of speaking. There's the truth of it! (drumming) Suppose we better save it as soon as we can, what with our souls in such a vulnerable state and all. Amen to that. Thank you. Why would he do this to us? If Jack is the chief... Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief, but he only remains chief as long as he acts like a chief. So he had no choice. He's a captive as much as the rest of us. Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a god in human form, and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison. (yelps) They'll roast him and eat him. Where's the rest of the crew? These cages we're in weren't built till after we got here. The feast is about to begin. Jack's life will end when the drums stop. Well, we can't just sit here and wait, then, can we? No, no. Oi! No, no. More wood. Big fire. Big fire. I am Chief. Want big fire. Come on. Oi. (cannibals' language) Tout de suite. Come on. More wood. Whoa! Oh, bugger. A little seasoning, eh? Well done. Put your legs through. Start to climb! Come on, men! It'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl! Actually, you wouldn't need everyone. About six would do. Oh, dear. - Hurry! - Come on! Come on! Is that all you got? - Wait. Stop. - Eh? Stop. Shh. Shh. - (Marty) What are they doing? - Stop. - Snake! - (screaming) Move! (speaks native language) (speaks native language) Well, go on, go get them. No, no. Oi! No, no! Not good. Cut it loose! Find a rock! (Cannibals shouting) Roll the cage! Come on! (screaming) - Lift the cage! Hurry! - Come on, lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt. (grunts) (screams) Run! This way, lads! Take cover! Stop it! (Boy speaks native language) (screams) (speaks native language) Bugger. (screams) (groans) Haul loose the mooring line! The mooring line! Thief! Little hairy thief! Give it back! - Don't bite it! - (Pintel) Haul loose the mooring line! He's got me eye. He won't give it back. - How'd you get it back last time? - Excellent! Our work's half done. We done it for you, knowing you'd be coming back. - Make ready to sail, boys! - What about Jack? - I won't leave without him. - (Jack) Oi! - Time to go. - Cast off those lines! Aaargh! - Make ready to cast off! - Oi! Good doggy. Alas, my children, this is the day you shall always remember as the day you almost... Captain Jack Sparrow. (dog barks) Let's get away from this island and head out to open sea. Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows. That seems a bit contradictory, Captain. I have faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills. Now, where is that monkey? I want to shoot something. Jack. Elizabeth is in danger. Have you considered just locking her up somewhere? She is locked up, bound to hang for helping you. There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes. I need that compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom. - Mr. Gibbs. - Captain. We have a need to travel upriver. By need, do you mean a trifling need? Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy? No, a resolute and unyielding need. What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste. William, I shall trade you the compass if you will help me to find this. - You want me to find this? - No. You want you to find this, because the finding of this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating in your discovering a way to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face. Savvy? This is going to save Elizabeth? How much do you know about Davy Jones? Not much. Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth. (arguing) What's all this? If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share and wear it one after the other. It's not like that, sir. This ship is haunted. Is it, now? And you? There's a female presence amongst us here, sir. All the men, they can feel it. It's the ghost of a lady widowed before her marriage, I figure it, searching for her husband, lost at sea. A virgin too, likely as not. And that bodes ill by all accounts. I say that we throw the dress overboard and we hope the spirit follows it. No! That will just anger the spirit, sir. What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then get it back to her. Enough! Enough! You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you. Now, this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway on board. A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find her. Oh, and, er... she's probably naked. - Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean? Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones, A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that'll suction your face clean off and drag an entire ship down to the crushing darkness. The Kraken. They say the stench of its breath is like... Imagine, the last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the kraken and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses. If you believe such things. And the key will spare him that? Well, that's the very question Jack wants answered. Bad enough even to go visit... her. Her? Aye. No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable, we are. Were. Have been. Before. - I'll watch your back. - It's me front I'm worried about. - Mind the boat. - Mind the boat. - Mind the boat. - Mind the boat. - Mind the boat. - (squawks) Mind the boat. Jack Sparrow. Tia Dalma. I always knew the wind was going to blow you back to me one day. You... You have a touch of... destiny about you, William Turner. You know me? You want to know me. There'll be no knowing here. We've come for help and we're not leaving without it. - I thought I knew you. - Not so well as I had hoped. - Come. - Come. What service may I do you? - You know I demand payment. - I brought payment. (whistles) Look. An undead monkey. Top that. Don't! You've no idea how long it took us to catch that. The payment is fair. We're looking for this. And what it goes to. The compass you bartered from me, it cannot lead you to this? Maybe. Why? I hear you. Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants. Or do you know, but are loath to claim it as your own? Your key go to a chest. And it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it? - What is inside? - Gold? Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature? Nothing bad, I hope? You know of Davy Jones, yes? A man of the sea. A great sailor, until he run afoul of that which vex all men. What vexes all men? What indeed? - The sea. - Sums. The dichotomy of good and evil. A woman. A woman. He fell in love. No, no, no, no. I heard it was the sea he fell in love with. Same story, different versions, and all are true. See, it was a woman as changing and harsh and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it cause him was too much to live with but not enough to cause him to die. What exactly did he put into the chest? Him heart. Literally or figuratively? He couldn't literally put his heart in a chest. Could he? It was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings. And so... him carve out him heart, lock it away in a chest and hide the chest from the world. The key he keep with him at all times. - You knew this. - I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do. All that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, eh? Let me see your hand. The black spot! - (Ragetti moans) The black spot! - (Pintel) Black spot! My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know. (Tia Dalma) I have just the thing. Now, where did I put it? (clattering) My little beauty, where are you? Such a long time in such a mess. Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot step on land but once every ten years. Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow, and so you will carry land with you. Dirt. - This is a jar of dirt. - Yes. Is the jar of dirt going to help? If you don't want it, give it back. - No. - Then it helps. It seems we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman. A touch of destiny. That's the Flying Dutchman? - She doesn't look like much. - Neither do you. Do not underestimate her. - Must have run afoul of the reef. - So, what's your plan, then? I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key. And if there are crewmen? I cut down anyone in my path. I like it. Simple, easy to remember. (Ragetti) Your chariot awaits you, Sire. Oi! If you do happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt. - It might save your life. - (Ragetti) Bon voyage! Douse the lamps. (mutters) Sailor. - Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders. - Sailor! Hoisting the jib. Bring up with a round turn. There's no use. You've run aground. No. Beneath us. Foul breath. (crash) (whimpering) Hey! Hey! (gasps) Down on your marrowbones and pray. Get back! Get back! (laughter) (thumping) Five men still alive. The rest have moved on. Do you fear death? Do you fear that dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished. I can offer you an escape. (man) Don't listen to him! Do you not fear death? I'll take my chances, sir. To the depths. Cruel blackguard! Life is cruel. Why should the afterlife be any different? I offer you a choice. Join my crew and postpone the judgment. One hundred years before the mast. Will ye serve? I- I will serve. There. (laughter) You are neither dead nor dying. What is your purpose here? Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt. What is your purpose here? Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt. Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer. (frightened gasps) Oh. You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for 13 years. That was our agreement. Technically I was only captain for two years, then I was mutinied upon. Then you were a poor captain, but a captain nonetheless. Have you not introduced yourself all these years as Captain Jack Sparrow? (laughter) You have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship. - One soul is not equal to another. - Aha! We've established my proposal is sound in principle. Now we're haggling over price. Price? Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth? One hundred souls. Three days. You're a diamond, mate. Send me back the boy. I'll get started right off. I keep the boy. A good-faith payment. That leaves you only 99 more to go. Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, a terrific soprano. Worth at least four. Maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love? With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony. Eh? I keep the boy. 99 souls. But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man, a friend, to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free? Yep. I'm good with it. Shall we seal it in blood? I mean... ink. (gasps) Three days. - Three days. - (whimpers) - Er, Mr. Gibbs. - Aye. I- I feel sullied and unusual. And how do you intend to harvest these 99 souls in three days? Fortunately, he was mum as to the condition in which these souls need be. Ah. Tortuga. Tortuga. It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing fees, wharf handling and, heaven help us, pilotage. Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then? I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters. A pirate port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what I am. I make my living fair and I sleep well each night. S- sir! (gasps) (Bursar) She wants you to do something. She's trying to give a sign. Whoa! Over there! Look for a sign! (sighs) Look, there! There it is! - There's the sign! - That's seaweed. - Seaweed can be a sign. - Looks like entrails. - That would be a bad sign. - (Deep voice) What's that over there? And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl? I've never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out, see the world while I'm still young. You'll do. Make your mark. Next! My wife ran off with my dog and I'm drunk for a month and I don't give an ass rat's if I live or die. - Perfect. Next! - I know what I want. I know what I want... - Me have one arm and a bum leg. - It's the crow's nest for you. - I know what I want. - (Gibbs) Next! Ever since I was a little lad, I've always wanted to sail the seas... forever. Sooner than you think. Sign the roster. Thanks very much. - (Jack) How we going? - Including those four, that gives us... four. And what's your story? My story. It's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the seven seas. The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission, and my life. - Commodore? - No, not any more. Weren't you listening? I nearly had you all off Tripoli. I would have, if not for the hurricane. Lord. You didn't try to sail through it? So, do I make your crew or not? You haven't said where you're going. Somewhere nice?! So, am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow? Or should I just kill you now? You're hired. Sorry. Old habits and all that. - Easy, sailor! - That's our captain you're threatening. (Band plays a merry jig) - Time to go. - Aye! - Thanks, mate. - Aargh! Carry on. Come on, then! Who wants some? Form an orderly line and I'll have you all, one by one. Come on, who's first? I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself. James Norrington. What has the world done to you? (Dramatic organ music) Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! - Heave! - Heave! Secure the mast tackle, Mr. Turner! Set to it! (Thunder) - Step aside. - Hey! Mind yourself! Let go, boy! No. Haul that weevil to his feet. Five lashes will remind you to stay on 'em! - No! - Impeding me in my duties? - You'll share the punishment. - I'll take it all. Will you, now? And what would prompt such an act of charity? My son. He's my son. (laughs) What fortuitous circumstance be this? Five lashes be owed, I believe it is. No. No, I won't! The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner. Your issue will feel its sting, be it by the bosun's hand or your own. No. - Bosun! - No! (Whip) (Whip) You had it easy, boy! - Will. - I don't need your help. The bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh from bone, with every swing. So I'm to understand what you did was an act of compassion? Yes. 100 years before the mast, losing who you were, bit by bit, until you end up... end up like poor Wyvern here. Once you've sworn an oath to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it. Not until your debt is paid. I've sworn no oath. You must get away. Not until I find this. The key. The dead man's chest. What do you know of this? Open the chest with the key, and stab the heart... No, don't stab the heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart or there'll be no captain, and if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key. So the captain has the key? - Where is the key? - Hidden. - Where is the chest? - Hidden. Captain Sparrow! Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard. I'm here to find the man I love. I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea. Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow. Elizabeth. Hide the rum. These clothes do not flatter you. It should be a dress or nothing. - I happen to have no dress in my cabin. - Jack. I know Will came to find you. Where is he? Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but... through unfortunate circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew. Davy Jones? (Splutters) Oh, please. The captain of the Flying Dutchman? - You look awful. What are you doing here? - You hired me. I can't help it if your standards are lax. - You smell funny. - Jack! All I want is to find Will. Are you certain? Is that what you really want most? Of course. Because I would think you'd want to find a way to save Will most. - And you'd have a way of doing that? - Well... - ...there is a chest. - Oh, dear. A chest of unknown size and origin. What contains the still-beating heart of Davy Jones. And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including saving brave William from his grim fate. You don't actually believe him, do you? How would we find it? With this. My compass... is unique. ""Unique"" here having the meaning of ""broken"". True enough, this compass does not point north. (Norrington vomits) Where does it point? It points to the thing you want most in this world. Oh, Jack. - Are you telling the truth? - Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not? - To save Will. - By finding the chest of Davy Jones. - Mr. Gibbs! - Cap'n. - We have our heading. - Finally! Cast off those lines. Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas! - Miss Swann. - (Gibb shouts orders to crew) Welcome to the crew, former commodore. There's something to knowing the exact shape of the world and one's place in it. I assure you, these are not necessary. I thought you'd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter. - You have news of her? - Most recently seen on Tortuga, and then left in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow, and other fugitives from justice. ""Justice""? Hardly. Including the previous owner of this sword, I believe. Our ships are in pursuit. Justice will be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass, and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal. I find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board. What do you want from me? Your authority as governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company. To you, you mean. Shall I remove these shackles? Do what you can for my daughter. (Beckett) So you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept. Even for what he hoped never to sell. I wager... ten years. I'll match ten years. Agreed. Wondering how it's played? - I understand. - Liar! (Will) It's a game of deception. But your bet includes all the dice, not just your own. - What are they wagering? - Oh, the only thing we have. Years of service. - So any crew member can be challenged? - Aye. Anyone. I challenge Davy Jones. (Heavy footsteps) I accept, mate. - The stakes? - My soul. An eternity of servitude. No! Against? I want this. - How do you know of the key? - That's not part of the game, is it? You can still walk away. - What's this? - I'm in. Matching his wager. No! Don't do this. The die is cast. I bid three twos. It's your bid, Captain. Four fours. Four fives. Six threes. Seven fives. Eight fives. Welcome to the crew, lad. Twelve fives. Twelve fives. Call me a liar, or up the bid. And be called a liar myself for my trouble? Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship. Master Turner, feel free to go ashore... the very next time we make port! Fool. Why did you do that? I couldn't let you lose. It was never about winning or losing. The key. You just wanted to know where it was. (Snores) Captain says I'm to relieve you. Captain's orders. (Snores) (Grunts) (Plays note) (Plays lullaby) Here. Take this, too. Now, get yourself to land, and stay there. It was always in my blood to die at sea. It was not a fate I ever wanted for you. It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either. Aye. I could say I did what I had to, when I left you to go pirating. But it would taste a lie to say it wasn't what I wanted. You owe me nothing, Will. Now go. - They'll know you helped me. - (Laughs) What more can they do to me? I take this with a promise. I'll find a way to sever Jones's hold on you, and not rest until this blade pierces his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise. - (Gibbs) Beckett? - (Elizabeth) Yes, they're signed. Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company. Bleurgh! Will was working for Beckett and never said a word. Beckett wants the compass. Only one reason for that. Of course. - He wants the chest. - Yes, he did say something about a chest. If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea. - A truly discomfiting notion, love. - And bad. Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate. I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails. Brace the foreyard! Might I enquire as to how you came by these? - Persuasion. - Friendly? Decidedly not. Will strikes a deal, yet you were the one with the prize - full pardon. ""Commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company."" As if I could be bought for such a low price. - Jack, the letters, give them back. - No. Persuade me. You do know Will taught me how to handle a sword? As I said, persuade me. It's a curious thing. There was a time I would have wanted you to look like that while thinking about me. - I don't know what you mean. - I think you do. Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's all. So you never wondered how your latest fianc ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place? (man) Strange thing to come upon a longboat so far out in open water. Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can. And what are we running from? That dress. Where did you get it? It was found aboard the ship. The crew thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill-fate. - That's foolish. - Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish. It brought good fortune. The spirit told us, ""Pull in at Tortuga"", and we made a nice bit of profit there. Off the books, of course. I imagine some of your crew may have jumped ship there. - Why do you ask? - Captain! A ship's been spotted. - Colors? - She isn't flying any. - Pirates. - Or worse. You will watch this. Aagh! Let no joyful voice be heard! Let no man look up at the sky with hope. Aargh! And let this day be cursed by we who ready to wake... the kraken. No! I've doomed us all. It's the Flying Dutchman! (Crash) Oh, Mother Carey's chickens! What happened? Must have hit a reef. Free the rudder! Hard to port then hard to starboard. - Free the rudder! - Hard to port! (Man screams) - Kraken! - Kraken! Here it is! Take it! Take it! Aargh! Agh! Aaaagh! (Screaming) Aagh! Aaagh! The boy's not here. He must have been claimed by the sea. I am the sea. You need time alone with your thoughts. - Brig! - What of the survivors? There are no survivors. (Grunts) The chest is no longer safe. Chart a course to Isla Cruces. Get me there first, or there'll be the devil to pay. ""First""? Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship? Who told him of the key? Jack Sparrow. My intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled. I just thought I'd be married by now. I'm so ready to be married. You know... (Clears throat) Lizzie, I am captain of a ship, and being captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a ""marr-i-age"" right here. Right on this deck. Right... now. No, thank you. Why not? We are very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us. Oh. Except for a sense of honor and decency and a moral center. And personal hygiene. Trifles. You will come over to my side. I know it. - You seem very certain. - One word, love. Curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist. Why doesn't your compass work? My compass works fine. Because you and I are alike, and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. - To do the right thing. - I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by. You'll have the chance to do something... something courageous. And when you do, you'll discover something. That you're a good man. All evidence to the contrary. Oh, I have faith in you. - Want to know why? - Do tell, dearie. Curiosity. You're going to want it. A chance to be admired and gain the rewards that follow. You won't be able to resist. You're going to want to know what it tastes like. I do want to know what it tastes like. But... seeing as you're a good man, I know that you'd never put me in a position that would compromise my honor. I'm proud of you, Jack. (Gibbs) Land, ho! I want my jar of dirt. - You're pulling too fast. - You're pulling too slow. - We don't want the kraken to catch us. - I'm saving me strength for when it comes. And I don't think it's ""Kracken"" anyways. I always heard it said ""Krayken"". - With a long ""a""? - Uh-huh. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. ""Krocken"" is how it's pronounced in Scandinavian, and ""Kracken"" is closer to that. We ain't Scandinavians, are we? ""Krayken."" It's a mythological creature. I can calls it what I wants. Guard the boat. Mind the tide. Don't touch my dirt. This doesn't work. And it certainly doesn't show you what you want most. (Jack) Yes, it does. You're sitting on it. - Beg pardon? - Move. - ""Guard the boat!"" ""Mind the tide!"" - I could join the circus. Mind if I shine your shoes, sir? They're here. And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade. You'll trust us to act in your stead? I'll trust you to know what awaits you should you fail! - Down, then! - Down! (Shouting) (Beating) It's real. You actually were telling the truth. I do that quite a lot, yet people are always surprised. With good reason! Will! You're all right! Thank God! I came to find you! (Jack) How did you get here? Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped to my feet. Not so easy, is it? - But I do owe you thanks, Jack. - You do? After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones... - What? - (imitates Elizabeth) What? ...I was reunited with my father. Oh, well... you're welcome, then. Everything you said to me, every word was a lie! Pretty much. Time and tide, love. Oi! What are you doing? I'm going to kill Jones. Can't let you do that, William. Cos if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now, if you please. The key. I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it. I can't let you do that either. So sorry. I knew you'd warm up to me eventually. Lord Beckett desires the content of that chest. I deliver it, I get my life back. Ah. The dark side of ambition. Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption. Aagh! (Elizabeth) Stop it! Hyah! (Elizabeth) Will! - Guard the chest! - No! This is barbaric! This is no way for grown men to... Oh, fine! Let's just haul out our swords and start banging away at each other. That will solve everything! I've had it! I've had it with wobbly-legged, rum-soaked pirates! - How'd this go all screwy? - Well, each wants the chest for hisself. Mr. Norrington, I think, is trying to regain a bit of honor, old Jack's looking to trade it, save his own skin, then Turner, there, I think he's trying to settle some unresolved business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father. (belches) - Sad. - (Elizabeth) This is madness! That chest must be worth more than a shiny penny. Terrible temptation. If we was any kind of decent, we'd remove temptation from their path. Enough! Oh. Oh! The heat! Bugger! By your leave, Mr. Turner. (Snarling) (Bell chimes) By your leave, Mr. Norrington. (Bell chimes) Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life. - Be my guest. - Let us examine that claim for a moment. Who was it, that at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself? Eh? So whose fault is it, really, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates? Enough! Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right! Still rooting for you, mate. Oh! Oof! Aargh! (Pintel) We got it! We got it! We got it! Hello, poppet. (Shouting) Come on, run! (Elizabeth screams) - (Elizabeth) Sword! - Sword! Sword! Sword! Aargh! Ugh! (Speaks gibberish) Follow my voice. Follow my voice. To the left... no, turn around. Go to the right. No, that's a tree. Oh, shut it. (Beating) Jar of dirt! Argh! Right. (Pintel) We've got it! Come on, Turner! Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with. - We're not getting out of this. - Not with the chest. Into the boat. - You're mad! - Don't wait for me. - I say we respect his final wish. - Aye! (Chuckling) Your bravery is wasted. I shall pry the chest away from your cold, dead hands. - Here you go! - Oof! (Laughing) (Speaks gibberish) Pirates! (Mutters) Hey! - What happened to the chest? - Norrington took it to draw them off. - You're pulling too hard! - You ain't pulling hard enough! - Where's the commodore? - Fell behind. My prayers be with him. Best not wallow in our grief. The bright side is you're back, and made it off free and clear. Lord on high, deliver us. I'll handle this, mate. Oi, fishface! Lose something? Eh? Scungilli! Got it! Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git? Look what I got. # I got a jar of dirt, I got a jar of dirt # And guess what's inside it? Enough! - Hard to starboard. - Hard to starboard! Brace up the foreyard! Hard to starboard! Send his beloved Pearl back to the depths. She's on us! She's on us! - Let them taste the triple guns. - Aye, Captain. Aaargh! Make fast! Go on, me darling! Show us what you've got! Come on, girl! - She's falling behind! - Aye. We've got her! - We're the faster? - Against the wind, the Dutchman beats us. - But with the wind... - We rob her advantage. Aye. We're out of range! Break off pursuit, run her light and douse canvas! We're giving up, sir? Agh! They're giving up! (Cheering) My father is on that ship. We can take her. We should turn and fight. Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs is the proper leverage. Oh! (Whimpers) Where is it? Where is the thump-thump? We must have hit a reef! No. It's not a reef! Get away from the rail! - What is it? - The kraken. - To arms! - Load guns! Defend the mast! It'll attack the starboard. Run out the cannons and hold for my signal! Easy, boys! Will? Steady! Steady. - Will! - Hold. Hold. I think we've held fire long enough. - Will! - Fire! Oh! (Cheering) - It'll be back. We have to get off the ship. - There's no boats. Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder onto the net in the cargo hold! - Whatever you do, don't miss. - As soon as you're clear. We are short-stocked on gunpowder! Six barrels! Hurry up! - There's only six kegs of powder! - Then load the rum. Aye, the rum too! Step to! Oh, you coward. (Thud) Not good. - Haul away! - Heave! - Heave like you're being paid for it! - Put your backs into it! (Screaming) Aargh! (Whimpers) - I got you! I got you! - Don't let me go! - I won't let you go! - Shoot me! - Clear? - Higher! Higher! Here! Come on! Come and get me. I'm over here! Come on! Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot! (Screams) (Kraken bellows) Did we kill it? No. We just made it angry. We're not out of this yet. Captain, orders! Abandon ship. Into the longboat. Jack. The Pearl. She's only a ship, mate. He's right. We have to head for land. - It's a lot of open water. - It's a lot of water. We have to try. We can get away as it takes down the Pearl. Abandon ship. Abandon ship or abandon hope. Thank you, Jack. We're not free yet, love. You came back. I always knew you were a good man. Prepare to cast off. There's no time to lose. Come on, Will. Step to! (Chains clink) It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see? I'm not sorry. Pirate. Where's Jack? He elected to stay behind to give us a chance. Go! Bugger. Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger! Come on! Just got it. Come on. (Roars) Not so bad. Oh. Hello, beastie. Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled. The captain goes down with his ship. Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can best the devil. Open the chest. Open the chest. I need to see it! Damn you, Jack Sparrow! (Mercer) The last of our ships is returned. Is there any news on the chest? None. But one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea. He had these. I took the liberty of filling in my name. If you intend to claim these, then you must have something to trade. Do you have the compass? Better. (Beating) The heart of Davy Jones. Against the cold... and the sorrow. It's a shame. I know you're thinking that with the Pearl you could have captured the devil and set free your father's soul. Doesn't matter now. The Pearl is gone, along with its captain. (Gibbs) Aye. And already the world seems a bit less bright. He fooled us all right till the end, but I guess that honest streak finally won out. To Jack Sparrow. - Never another like Captain Jack. - He was a gentleman of fortune, he was. He was a good man. If there was anything could be done to bring him back... - Elizabeth. - Would you do it? Hm? What would you... Hm? What would any of you be willing to do, hm? Would you sail to the ends of the Earth and beyond to fetch back witty Jack and him precious Pearl? Aye. Aye. Aye. (Parrot squawks) Aye. Yes. Aye. All right. But if you go and brave the weird and haunted shores at world's end... then you will need a captain who knows those waters. So tell me, what's become of my ship?, It was good ... ... that you called us. I don't know what happened. We were at the bar... ... drinking, having fun ... I don't even know how I got there. Come on, she's been under too long. You're the only one who can help me. Come on, come on ... - Tell me what I need to know. - They'll kill me. You asked for my help. Come on. The contact in Minsk ... Give us the name. Dimitri ... Miediev. - What now? - Now we drink. To friends. Get rid of that scum. - Did we get it? - We got it. Would you like to watch a movie, Mr Rosen? - Care to watch a movie, Mr Phelps? - No, I prefer the theatre. Would you consider the cinema of the Ukraine? Perhaps you'd choose one for me. Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Phelps. This is Alexander Golitsyn, - - an attach at our embassy in Prague. He is also a traitor. He has stolen one half of a CIA NOC list - - of all our deep cover agents in Eastern Europe. For security reasons, the NOC list is divided in two. The portion Golitsyn has contains code names. It is useless without its mate, which matches the codes with true names. It is this half Golitsyn plans to steal at an embassy reception tomorrow. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to obtain proof of the theft. Shadow Golitsyn to his buyer and apprehend them both. I've dispatched a team selected from your group. Sarah Davies is undercover now. Jack Harmon can hack into their system. Hannah Williams will do surveillance. Your wife, Claire, will cover transport. And Ethan Hunt will be your pointman, as usual. He is now in Kiev and will rendezvous with you in Prague. Should any member of your IM force be caught or killed, - - the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions. This tape will self-destruct in five seconds. Good luck, Jim. A very straightforward objective. We photograph Golitsyn stealing the NOC list, follow him to his buyer, - - apprehend both of them. Now, here's the plot. Ethan ... You go into the embassy in character, during a party. Hide in plain sight. - You game? - Wouldn't have it any other way. Sarah, you're there as the embassy's Washington visitors' liaison. You and Ethan will run the game. - I haven't a thing to wear. - Well, I'm sure you'll work it out. Mark Golitsyn and hand him off to Hannah. Hannah, you stay on him. Jack, fingerprint security is accessed through the elevator shaft here. - So I guess I'm not wearing my tux. - Open, close, get out. Claire, you're in the vehicle. Hannah will join you as Golitsyn goes exterior. You two stay on him. If I call ""abort"", everybody walk away immediately. Regroup here at 4:00 a.m. Any questions? Can we get a cappuccino machine? I don't know what you call this. - I call it cruel and unusual. - I made that coffee. Is it possible that it's worse than the sludge you made in Kiev? - Hey, take it easy on my wife's coffee. - We missed you in Kiev, Jim. - Off on a cushy recruiting assignment? - Did they put you at the Plaza? Drake Hotel, Chicago. - Punishing! 24-hour room service. - Chauffeured cars. He's getting soft in his old age. Okay, listen. If that list gets out into the open, - - the names of our agents will be up for grabs to the highest bidders. Terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords. Everyone who wants to get rid of us. If they're exposed, they'll be executed. I'll run the whole show from here. Let's punch out the details. There's a camera built into the bridge. It transmits what you see back here. Can you hear me? No, you need an earpiece. You have lovely eyes ... Can you hear me now? If he has a car waiting, and he rolls, stay with him no matter what. - You should check out these streets. - What do you think I've been doing? - We're using Waltzer? - He's our guy. - Isn't he chairing a hearing? - Not this week. This week he's fly-fishing in County Kildare with one of our lrish guides. And he won't be back anytime soon. Senator, it sounds as lf you want to lead the kind of charge - - that Sen. Church led in the 70's, and destroy the US's intelligence capability. I want to know who they are and how they're spending the taxpayers'money. This is still a democracy. Stick of gum, right? No. Red light, green light. You have a lock you can't pick, you mash them together ... Hasta lasagne, don't get any on ya'. You'll have about five seconds. Just don't chew it. Ethan, Jack's inside. Let's go. How do you do, Senator? How was the opera? - It was boring. - Let me see if I can steer you through. - Windows open by 2300. - Mr Brandl, the mayor, and Mrs Brandl. Senator, I bet you don't remember me, do you? - Of course. How are you, Ms Norman? - He's in pocket, on the stairway. Mr Golitsyn, nice to see you. Hannah. Pull the shade. Sarah, mark the package and go to two. Your advance team said you'd like a tour of the facility. This way. Oh, great. ... which leads to the Denied Area, the only limited access area here. Governor's in position now. - Can I help you? - As you can see, there's surveillance. I'm sorry, I know it's in here somewhere. Sergeant, why are you not in uniform? We've been ordered to wear civilian clothes, sir. Be right back. - Do you have a Jack on your staff? - I believe we did. An unreliable fellow, as I recall. Constantly late and behind in his work. We were forced to tie him to a horse and drag him around mybarn. I'm working on it. Sorry. Thank you. Have a nice evening. That date with Sarah is definitely off. Higher. He's heading to the Denied Area. Get moving, Ethan. He's rolling to you. Jack ... Jack, we're in position here. I didn't touch it. - What about my coat? I'll freeze. - Jack, open the doors. He's in the box, Ethan. - We'll take his exit. Open these doors. - I don't have it. I'm opening the doors. Go under. - He's got it. - All right. - I saved your ass again, Jack. - Such a nice ass. - And a lonely ass. - Transport in five minutes. Jack, we're in position. Open the doors and let the package roll. Stairway, you're wrapped. Go to transport. - Jack, what are you doing? - Nothing. I don't have control, Jack. Cut the power. - Cut the power. - Come on, Jack. Jack ... Jack ... Jack? - Jack, do you copy? - Man down, Ethan. Man down. Ethan, stay where you are. I'm coming to you. The package is out in the open. - Jim, he's in the open. - En route. Jim, he's in the open. Jim, the package is in the open. I've got a shadow. I can't lose him. Abort! Ethan, he's out of pocket. - I can't do that. - We're being ambushed. Abort! - Negative. Golitsyn is on the move. - No, dammit, I said abort! - Eye on the package. Jim, I'm coming. - Jim gave an abort. We are going to recover that disk. You understand me? Now go! - Where are you? - 200 yards from the bridge. They're covering the frequency. Cut all radio communication. Ethan ... Sarah, abort. Repeat: abort! Abort! Do you read me? Sarah ... Oh my God! - Satcom 7. - Central Europe, unsecured. - Designator? - Bravo, echo, one, one. - This is Kittridge. - Go secure. This is Ethan Hunt. They're dead. - Who's dead? - My team. My team is dead! Golitsyn's gone. They knew we were coming. The disk is gone. - Are you intact? - The list is in the open! Let's just bring you in safely, then we'll worry about that. - Were you followed? - I don't think so. Don't think. Be sure. Are you clean? Yes. Location Green, one hour. I'llbe there myself. - You're in Prague? - One hour. I ... I can't tell you how sorry I am. I know how much Jim, in particular, meant to you. - Personally as well as professionally. - Yeah ... Here's a passport and visa. Usual drill. We'll work the exfiltration through Canada - - and throw the Prague police a bone, toss them a few suspects. - You follow me? - Yeah, I follow you. - We've lost enough agents for tonight. - You mean, I have. - You're bent on blaming yourself. - Who else is left? Yeah, I see your point. - Why was there another team? - What? The IMF agents at the embassy. I don't quite follow you. Then follow me around the room. The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock. The couple waltzing around me, the waiter standing behind Hannah. Bow tie at 12 o'clock. The other IMF team. You're worried about me. Why? For two years we've been spotting a blowback - - in IMF operations. We have a penetration. We've decoded an lnternet message from a Czech we know as ""Max'. - The arms dealer. - That's right. Max has a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he got on the inside, in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he called ""Job 3-14"". He thought Golitsyn was doing it tonight. - The list he stole was a decoy. - That's correct. The actual list is secure at Langley. Golitsyn was one of ours. This whole operation was a mole hunt. - The whole operation was a mole hunt. - Yeah. The mole's deep inside. And like you said ... ... you survived. I want to show you something. Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in receivership. Suddenly, they have 120 grand in the bank. The illness was supposed to have wiped out that account. Dying slowly in America can be a very expensive proposition. So why don't we quietly get out of here and onto a plane? - I can understand you're very upset. - You've never seen me very upset. Enough is enough. You've bribed and killed, using loyalties on the inside. You want to shake hands with the devil? Fine, but you'll do it in hell. Money, money ... Where's the damn money? We've decoded an lnternet message from a Czech we know as ""Max"". He got in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he called ""Job 3-14"". ""... asleep and at rest with kings and counsellors of the earth ..."" You son of a bitch. Ethan ... What are you doing? I needed you. On the bridge. But you weren't there. - Don't move. - Ethan ... - You were in the car. - No, I wasn't. - I heard on the radio ... - I saw you, you were in the car. No, I got out of the car. I ran to the bridge. He said someone was ... Don't give me that. I was on the bridge. There was nobody there. - What happened to Jim? - Wake up! Jim's dead! They're all dead! - Who sent you for me? - Jim's dead ... Take off your coat. I walked away. He said abort. I just walked away. That was four hours ago. Who sent you? Did they send you? No one sent me. We were supposed to be back here at four o'clock if we abort. 0400. Four a.m. Four o'clock. It's four o'clock. If we abort ... four a.m. I've been disavowed. They actually think I killed Jim and everyone else. Somehow, $100,000 finds its way into my parents' bank account. Kittridge assumes I'm the mole, employed by an arms dealer, Max, - - for the last two years, to get him our NOC list. - What are you going to do? - I'm going to get it for him. Ethan, you're not making any sense. Whoever the mole is, he goes by the name of Job. I can't find him, but if he knows I have the NOC list, he'll find me. I'm going to go in and tell Kittridge you have nothing to do with this. Claire, if you're not dead, he'll assume you're with me. The message is for Job. That's right. And I'm going to answer it. Excuse me, could I trouble you for a match? Remove your hat, please. - Why? - You wish to meet Max? The price of admission. - I thought I was going to see Max. - You misunderstood. No one sees Max. - Then why the hell am I here? - So he can hear what you have to say. I don't communicate well through a shroud. If Max doesn't like what you say, you'll be wearing it indefinitely. I'm willing to take the chance. Very well. Who are you and what are you doing here? I need $150,000. Really? And you thought if you simply showed up, I might give it to you? Why not? You gave Job 125. The penny drops. You are not Job. Job is not given to quoting scripture in his communications. Its tone was aggressive but playful. Job is not playful. - So you are something of a paradox. - Well, that depends. - On what? - Whether you like a paradox. - I want $150,000 today. - That's quite out of the question. The disk Job sold you is worthless. It's bait. Part of an internal mole hunt. And how might you know that? Are you another company man? Like Job? We're asking about you. I'm NOC. Was ... Now disavowed. - Why, may I ask? - That's what I want to ask Job. I don't know Job any more than Job knows me. You could arrange an introduction. - Why should l? - I can deliver the actual NOC list. Your list is worthless, and it's probably equipped with a homing device. Boot it up. In 10 minutes you'll have the CIA hopping around you like rabbits. It's easy to say it's worthless if I can't look at it to see if it's worthless. - Not a tenable position, sir. - Okay, use it. But I'd suggest you pack first. - 26-27. So far, so good. - Not so good for you, my friend. I'd say you've got about two minutes. - 32 and 33. - Doesn't mean it's a signal. 44 and 45. The man's gone black, Barnes. He's under until he decides to surface. - We can cut off his transportation. - What can we do, Barnes? Put a guy at the airport? How many identities does Hunt have? How many times has he slipped past customs? These guys are trained to be ghosts. We taught them! What do you suggest? Let's make him come to us. You find something that's personally important to him and you squeeze. Gnther will never let me have one of his apartments again. - Sorry I doubted you, dear boy. - Thanks, Max. Or is it Maxine? I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity is in my profession. It's like a warm blanket. My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan. The deal's off. - What was your deal with Job? - Six million dollars. I'll give you the same, for the complete list, not just Eastern Europe. I won't do this piecemeal. It's too dangerous. 10 million, in negotiable US Treasury certificates, coupons attached. And one more thing ... Your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange. - Max made a deal with you? - I deliver the list, Max delivers Job. We've 75 rounds for the Beretta, but only 20 for the Sig-Sauer. One pair of Visco glasses. Plenty of passports ... Well, you said it yourself. If I'm not dead, I'm with you. - Are you sure? - Jim was my husband. I want to get the son of a bitch who did this. - We need help. They'll have to be local. - What kind of help? Simple game. Four players. Exfil opens the pocket, cyber ops lifts the wallet. - Bank? - IMF mainframe. - Where exactly is it? - In Langley. In Langley? The one in Virginia? Inside CIA headquarters at Langley? - Is he serious? - Always. Why don't we drop by Fort Knox? I can fly a helicopter into the vault. It would be easier than breaking into the CIA. - What kind of information is it? - Profitable. Payment on delivery. I don't know. I just don't know. This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I heard of. What did they used to call you? The Net Ranger? The only man to hack NATO Ghostcom. There was never any evidence that I had anything to do with that ... ... with that exceptional piece of work. You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt Everest of hacks. You're kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto, Stu 3's ... - Krieger can get it. Right? - It may take a little time. That's not what Claire says about you. Thinking Machine laptops. The 686 prototypes, with the artificial intelligence Risc chip. 24 hours. And I get to keep the equipment when we're done. Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses. Look, I just can't hack my way inside. No modem access to a mainframe. It's in what we call a ""stand-alone"". Which means I'd have to be physically at the terminal. Relax, it's much worse than you think. It's in a black vault lock-down. The onlyperson allowed in the room has to pass through security checks. The first is a voiceprint identifiication and a six-digit access code. This only gets him into the outerroom. Next he has to pass a retinal scan. And the intrusion countermeasures are deactivated by an electronic key card. Which we won't have. Inside the black vault, three systems operate whenever the technician is out. The first is sound sensitive. Anything above a whisper sets it off. The second system detects any increase in temperature. The bodyheat of an intruder will trigger it if the temperature rises one degree. That temperature is controlled by the air conditioning duct, - - 30 feet above the floor. That vent is guarded by a lasernet. The third system is on the floor and is pressure sensitive. The slightest increase in weight will trigger the alarm. If any one of these systems is set off, it will activate an automatic lock-down. Believe me when I tell you, all three systems are state of the art. And you really think we can do this? We're going to do it. Alarms in sectors 3, 7 and 12. - What sector's the air conditioning? - 21. But there's no alarm in 21. No one goes into any sector where the alarm hasn't gone off, and it hasn't... - It's gone off. Let's go. - Let's move. - Can I get you anything? - No, thank you. 21's through here. - He's recruiting. For what purpose? - Survival. Too short-sighted. This guy initiates. The question is, what does he want? Where does he need to get it? Barnes, what the hell is that noise? - Fire alarm, Gene. - Do we have to evacuate? Hey, where's the other guy? - Zero body count. - We'll see. Hi, there. One, two, three. Toast, toast. - Check. - Good. Okay, Luther, I'm going in. Everest, man. You ready to plant the flag? - Damn. - Krieger, from now on, total silence. He's rolling to you. - He's at the voiceprint corridor. - William Donloe. Outer room. He's coming in the vault. Come on, move. He's in the bathroom. A-W-9 - - 6-B-6. Holy mother of God. A NOC list. He's at the vault. Four yellows. One red. Get moving. Toast. Oh, my God. - It's for you. - Kittridge. You and I know about this. That's where it stops. - It never happened. - What about him? I want him manning a radar tower in Alaska by the end of the day. Are you contacting your buyer? Ethan? Ethan? Oh, excuse me. ""Mr Hunt"". You're not going to any meeting without me. My contact is extremely shy. I don't think you're in any position to give orders. - Not while I'm holding this. - Krieger ... Shut up. - You mean this? - That's not the list. You've never seen this trick? Where did it go? It's gone. - What? - You ... no? But not too far. I know what you're thinking. ""ln the computer room, I was up here and he was down there."" ""He was carrying two disks."" - It's hard to keep track of these things. - Where is it? Do you actually think I'd let you have the NOC list? Try any sleight of hand with my money and I'll cut your throat. - On a cushy recruiting assignment? - Did they put you at the Plaza? Drake Hotel, Chicago. I'm so sorry. Krieger was my call. I'm sorry, Ethan. We did what we had to do. I'm going to try and get some sleep. Krieger did have the NOC list? Hold on to it. If you knew what you were getting into, you wouldn't have done it. I'm not going to let this get out in the open. Exactly. That's your job tomorrow on the train. Don't let it get out in the open. - What is the range of this thing? - It's hard to tell. I'll have to be close. The unlikely setting, a farm in the heartland of America, Wisconsin. Here, Federal agents found the brains behind an international drug ring: Margaret Ethan Hunt and her brother-in-law, Donald Hunt. They were arrested this morning in a major sting operation - - designed to expose the illegal manufacture of the drug ""khat"". - What we have here is a case ... - Kittridge. I see you've been out visiting the folks. It's Hunt. What do you need for a pinpoint? Been watching a little TV? Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles was an especially nice touch. - He's in England. - Get Ml5. My first order of business after you come in - - is to have these ridiculous charges against your family dropped. If you come in now, - - we can play down the charges against you, as well. - Can I ask you something, Kittridge? - Certainly, Ethan. If you're dealing with someone - - who's crushed, stabbed, - - shot and detonated - - fiive members ofhis own IMF team, - - how devastated will you make him by arresting Ma and Uncle Donald? I don't know, Ethan. Why don't you tell me? Lost him. We needed three more seconds. He wanted us to know he was in London. You're a hard man to catch up with. The next day I dragged myself back to the safe house. - I checked our aliases. - And you picked us up in the States. But you'd gone, and I could check just so many places. Some European countries don't computerise customs records. Once you turned up in England, it was easy. - You know I like Liverpool St. rentals. - I showed them to you. I remember. A doctor's got to look at that. You can't sit up straight. I can sit up straight. I just can't sit up straight very well. Sit down. Ethan ... I saw who shot me. I saw the mole. - It was Kittridge. - Kittridge ... Kittridge, Ethan! Kittridge is the mole. My God. Of course, you're right. He was at the embassy that night. First he took out Jack, at the elevator. He shot you on the bridge. He must have had back-up to take out Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence. How did he do Hannah? No, he could've done Hannah himself. Why, Jim? Why? When you think about it, it was inevitable. No more Cold War. No more secrets to keep from everyone but yourself. Then suddenly the President is running the country without your permission. The son of a bitch, how dare he? And you realise it's over. You're obsolete hardware, with a lousy marriage and 62 grand a year. Kittridge. We'll go after the no-good son of a bitch, big time. We won't have to. He'll come after us. - What's going to make him do that? - What he didn't get in Prague. The NOC list. Jesus, Ethan. Good for you. - We meet tomorrow, the TGV to Paris. - Tight security. No guns. Real plus. I deliver the NOC list to Max, Max delivers Job to me. Claire and Luther will be on the train. Krieger will have a helicopter in Paris. Jim? I was in a cafe, waiting for you ... ... and there she was. Standing in the rain, alive and beautiful, thinking I'm dead and gone. God knows what she's had to do to forget me, to keep going. She can't know about me. No one can. Not till this is over. - You're probably right. - There's too much at stake. Once we leave the safe house, you get in there and crash. - I'll call from Paris. - You got it. What happened? I sent the message to Max. We're on for tomorrow. Okay. Come here. - What's this? - Incoming for you. X-ray's clean. Non-explosive. Gene. How long to the London terminus? We've got 10 minutes. Move! - Give me Max. - It's him. - This was not what we discussed. - My apologies. It couldn't be helped. You'll find the disk under your seat. Dear boy, I hope this doesn't preclude a meeting in private. - Not if you tell me where the money is. - The mere chance is worth 10 million. Baggage car, rack 3, silver briefcase, combination 3-1-4. - What about Job? - I wouldn't worry, he'll find you. - What's the matter? - It's not transmitting. We've got to get this through before we hit the tunnel. - What's the problem? - ""Connection denied."" - Did you check the batteries? - I always check the batteries. Run it through from the top. We don't know what Max looks like. If he's got that list, he'll want to check it. That means laptops. Excuse me, sir. Your telephone. - Is everything all right? - It's working. He's in the baggage car. - Ethan, Kittridge is on the train. - I'll meet you in the baggage car. Barnes. Ethan's right behind me. Listen, Jim ... Is it such a good idea to kill him? Kittridge is here. We take the money, Ethan takes the blame. No one else has seen you alive. No one will believe him. Of course, I'm very sorry to hear you say that, Claire. - Ethan. - Yes, Ethan Hunt. You remember him. - You knew about Jim? - Of course. When he knew is a good question. Mind telling me, Ethan? Before or after I showed up in London? Before London. After you took the Bible from the Drake Hotel in Chicago. They stamped it, didn't they? Damned Gideons. Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why ..? Why the masquerade? Why take the risk? You've asked the question ... and you are the answer. - I knew about Jim. - But he didn't know about you. Claire was never convinced her charms would work on you. But I was confident, having tasted the goods. ""Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife."" - Let's just get the money and get out. - Yes, let's get the money. Ethan, the money. Give her the money. You've earned it. - All 10 million. - Claire was wrong about one thing. Oh, what's that? Good morning, Mr Phelps. I'm not the only one who's seen you alive. - You son of a bitch. - It's over, Jim. - Don't. Don't, Jim. - ""Don't, Jim""? No, he's in the tunnel. He'll crash into us! Accelerate! Red light ... green light. I think this is what you're looking for. Hello, Max. My lawyers will have a field day with it. Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict ... Maybe we'll just leave the courts out of this one. I'm sure we can find something I have that you need. In a freak accident, a helicopter lost altitude, veered into a tunnel, - - and collided with a high-speed train. The pilot was killed, but no one on the train was hurt... - You call your folks? How do they feel? - About what? The Justice Department apology, VIP treatment, the whole nine yards. My mom didn't know how the DEA mistook them for drug smugglers. - Cheers. - To you, Luther. - And being off the disavowed list. - Hey, I'm the flavour of the month. Why don't you come back with me? I just don't know why I'd be doing it. I've got to catch my flight ... How does it feel to be a solid citizen? Man, I don't know. I'm going to miss being disreputable. If it makes you feel any better, I'll always think of you that way. Excuse me, Mr Hunt. Would you like to watch a movie? No, thank you. Would you consider the cinema of the Caribbean? Aruba, perhaps., Better hurry. Here you go, my friend. Make sure you get us as close as you can! I'll give you something extra if you make it a good trip. I'm going to get you close, but not too close. You don't want to be eaten. - Ready, amigo? - Ready! One, two, three! Eric, heave! Scared? This is great. See anything yet? No, not yet. - What was that? - I don't know. Hold on! - What's happening? - Just hold on! Make it stop! What happened to them? I don't know. Oh, my God. - We're going to crash! - No, we're not. I'm going to take this loose! - Let go of the rope! - We're gonna crash! Move your hands! Come on! Here we go! It's going be okay, bud. Charlie, those are herbivores. They wouldn't fight each other. But these are carnivores, and they really like fighting each other. They use their teeth and their claws to rip each other's throats out. Alan, he's three. Let's wait till he's five. Right. Sorry, Charlie. - Ellie? - Yeah? It's Tom. He says he has to talk to you about the last chapter. Tell him I won't lose the Horner quote. My editor thinks he's a paleontologist. Hey, Mark! Hey, babe, look who's here. This is Alan. Nice to meet you, Alan. Daddy, this is a herbivore and that's the dinosaur man. Dinosaur man? Jack, say my name. Is my name Alan? Is my name Alan? He used to know me. - It's sad, huh? - Here you go. Thanks. Mark's been working for the State Department now. What do they do, Mark? International relations, mostly treaty law, things like that. - Call of the wild one. - I'll go. You guys catch up. Thanks, babe. He's a great guy. - So, what are you working on now? - Raptors, mostly. My favourite. Do you remember the sounds they made? I try not to. All our theories about Raptor intelligence... ...what they were capable of, we weren't even close. - Tell me. - We did cranial scans of a fossil skull... ...and found what looks to be a very sophisticated resonating chamber. Wait a second. So we were right. - They'd the ability to vocalise. - lt's the key to their social intelligence. Which explains why they could work as a team. They'd coordinate attacks so their prey wouldn't know what was going on. - They could talk to each other. - To a degree we never imagined. Ellie, they were smart. They were smarter than dolphins or whales. They were smarter than primates. I just wanted to say, if you ever need help, sometimes you forget to ask. So you can call me. Anything, anytime. Sure. You're still the best. I mean that. The last of my breed. It is through the study of the anterior chamber in multiple specimens... ...that we can determine the correlation between the upper palate and the larynx. This lets us theorise, theorise, mind you... ...that the Raptor was capable of sophisticated vocalizations... ...which would have been a tremendous evolutionary advantage. Raptors were fierce, intelligent... ...and socially sophisticated. They were able to hunt in numbers and coordinate their efforts. Were it not for the cataclysmic events which overtook them... ...it's entirely possible that Raptors rather than humans... ...would have become the dominant species on this planet. I hope this has been of interest. It certainly excites us as paleontologists. There is much more to discover. That is why we continue to need, and ask for, your support. Thank you. Thank you very much, Dr. Grant. Now, does anyone have a question? Fine. Does anyone have a question that does not relate to Jurassic Park? Or the incident in San Diego... ...which I did not witness? Yes, sir? Your theory on Raptors is good, but isn't all this conjecture kind of moot? Once the U.N. and Costa Rica and everyone decide how to handle that second island... ...scientists will just go in and look for themselves. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago. What is left of them is fossilised... ...in the rocks. And it is in the rock... ...that real scientists make real discoveries. What John Hammond and Ingen did at Jurassic Park... ...is create genetically engineered theme park monsters. Nothing more and nothing less. Are you saying you wouldn't want to visit Isla Sorna... ...and study them if you had the chance? No force on Earth or Heaven... ...could get me on that island. What we got here, Nashy? Einhorn 20-millimetre, gas-operated semi-automatic. 10-shot, magazine fed, rotating bolt recoil-reducing muzzle brake. High explosive... Udesky. - It's Paul Kirby. Just checking... - Yes, sir. We're good to go here. Matter of fact, I can lock things down just as soon as you drop me that payment. Well, that's right... ...two of the very best men I could possibly find. No, I haven't worked with them personally... ...but believe me, sir, both of these men come very highly recommended. - Are you all right? - Nothing to worry about, sir. It's gonna be a walk in the park. Billy, I don't think I'm doing this right. Let's try the toothbrush. You've got to go slowly. Just take a little bit at a time. I can never tell what's rock and what's bone. Technically, it's all rock. The calcium in the bones is replaced during fossilization. But you can feel the difference. See? Rough... ...smooth. Rough, smooth. Dr. Grant. Mr. Brennan. So, how did it go? Well, it's not too late to change your major, Billy. - That good, huh? - Worse. We'll to have to pack up in four weeks. Three. I had to rent some equipment. Come here. I got to show you something. - You like computers, right? - I like the abacus, Billy. Meet the future of paleontology. It's a rapid prototyper. I enter the scanned data from the Raptor skull. The computer breaks it down into thousands of slices. And this thing sculpts it, one layer at a time. It's done. I give you the resonating chamber of a Velociraptor. Listen to this. Wow. This is brilliant, Billy. Really, it is. Sad to say, it's just a little bit late. Dr. Grant? Paul Kirby, Kirby Enterprises. My card. How you doing, Billy? What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? First thing, I'm a great admirer of yours. And I have a proposition I'd like to discuss with you. Would you have dinner with my wife and me this evening? - lt'll be our treat. - That'd be great but... ...l'm tired, I've been travelling. Maybe some other time. Believe me, this will be worth your while. - We'd love to. - Oh, terrific! That's the spirit. Good. This evening then. Billy, thank you for coming. Dr. Grant, how are you? Amanda, this is Billy and Dr. Grant. Mrs. Kirby, how are you? What are you boys drinking? - lce Pick, Catfish. - Two, please, Cat. - We've admired your work for years. - Really. Truly inspiring. Amanda and I just love the outdoors. We've been on nearly every adventure tour they can come up with: The Nile, Galapagos, K2. We even have two seats reserved on the first commercial flight to the moon. For our wedding anniversary this year, we wanted to do something really special. - Something... - Once in a lifetime. I've chartered an airplane to fly us over Isla Sorna. And we'd like you to be our guide. There you go, guys. That's a very kind offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm a very, very busy man. I can recommend a couple of guys who are really highly qualified... No, no. You're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. There's no one who comes close to you. You wouldn't be able to fly low enough to see anything of any real interest. That's the interesting part, because we have permission to fly low. How low? I'm no aviation expert, but a heck of a lot lower than anybody else. From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want. That's hard to believe. Through my business dealings, import-export, emerging markets... ...l've made a lot of friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government. Dr. Grant, you have no idea... ...how important it is that you come along. It would make all the difference. Mrs. Kirby, I... And, of course, we'd love to make a contribution to your research here. So... ...I could write all kinds of numbers on this cheque, Dr. Grant. Tell me... ...what's it gonna take? Even with what I pay you, couldn't you afford a better bag? No way. This one's lucky. Couple of years ago, some buddies and I went hang gliding... ...off these cliffs in New Zealand. And this big updraft came and swept me right against the side. Wham! That does sound lucky. It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got hooked on a rock as I was falling. Reverse Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic. Alan, I want to thank you for bringing me along. The bones will still be there when we get back. That's the great thing about bones. They never run away. And truth is, you got me into this. And I have no intention of being on my own with these people. Don't get too excited. Chances are, we won't see a thing. Your turn to be nice. Wake me when we get there. So how do you know the Kirbys? Through our church. Alan. Alan! Wake up. We're almost there. MAN ON RADIO: Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla Sorna... ...this is San Juan Approach. You're flying in restricted airspace. Immediately turn to coordinates two... My God, I had forgotten. We did it, honey. We're here. Cooper! if you see anything, yell up! No, I thought I'd keep it to myself. Everyone, if you look out the left of the plane... ...you can see a whole herd of Brachiosaurus. In fact, you can see at the front of the group the alpha male grazing there. Udesky? Nash? How about up front? You guys see anything? Nothing yet, Mr. Kirby. Mrs. Kirby, look! Out here, you'll see a group of... Mr. Kirby, we have a landing strip. You want me to put her down? No! I told you,  I want to circle first, see the whole island. What do you mean? You can't land! Hold on. I can explain... You cannot land on this island! - It will be fine. - Don't worry, please. - Are you crazy? - Sit down! Will you please sit down? Billy... ...tell me we didn't land. Eric! Ben! I think they're looking for someone. Ben! Dr. Grant, are you all right? - I'm sorry we had to be so rough. - Who hit me? Who hit me? That would be Cooper. What are they doing? Setting up a perimeter to make the place safe. Trust me, on this island, there's no such thing as safe! We have to get back on that plane! Tell your wife to stop making that noise! That is a very, very bad idea! - Amanda! - Ben! Honey, Dr. Grant said that's a bad idea! What? He says it's a bad idea! What's a bad idea? What was that? That's a Tyrannosaurus. I don't think so. It sounds bigger. We have to leave! We have to leave now! Get on the plane! Get on the plane! - What about the other guy? - Cooper's a professional. He can handle himself. Get on the plane! It's all right. - Paul, we can't... - lt's all right. We'll circle the island. Give me a hand, Udesky! Stop! What are you doing? That's Cooper! Stop. Come on, get out of the way! You know I can't stop this plane. Oh, my God! - Fuel cut-off! - We're going down! You okay? We're okay up here. Everyone, just stay put. San Juan Approach. Mayday, mayday! Who has the satellite phone? I do. I got it right here. We're not getting anything. The radio's gone. We haven't landed yet. - All circuits are busy. - Damn it! Oh, man. What was that? Keep still! Keep still! Relax. What is it? What? - What is it? - Hold it! Hang on, everyone! Help me! Mrs. Kirby, come back! Amanda! Follow me! This way! In here! I think we lost him. It's okay, it's dead. Nobody move a muscle. No, no! Please, don't! Stop, please. It's time you did some explaining, Mr. Kirby. We called everyone. We did everything we could. No one would help us. The Costa Rican government said this is a no-fly zone. The U.S. Embassy, that's our U.S. Embassy... ...told us we should accept the inevitable. Can you believe that? You let a 12-year-old go parasailing alone? - No! - He was with a friend. Ben Hildebrand. Paul and I divorced over a year ago. All right, why me? He said we needed someone who'd been on the island before. Yes, but I did not tell you to kidnap somebody. I have never been on this island. Sure you have. You wrote that book. That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna, Site B. You mean there are two islands with dinosaurs? - Stay out of this. - How long have they been missing? - Eight weeks. - Almost eight weeks now. Billy. We'll go back to the plane, salvage what we can. Then we make for the coast. Dr. Grant, we're not leaving this island without our son. Then you can go and look for him. Or you can stick with us, as long as you don't hold us up. Either way... ...you probably won't get off this island alive. So? What do we do? We search for your son... ...in the direction that they're going. Excellent. PAUL: Sorry. It's nothing you haven't seen before, Paul. How much weight did you say you lost? About 25 pounds. I've been swimming. Swimming? You hate to swim. You don't even know how to swim. I know. I learned. - You look good. - So do you. - How would you classify it, Billy? - Well... ...it's a super-predator. A Suchomimus. - That snout. - No, think bigger. - Baryonyx? - Not with that sail. Spinosaurus aegypticus. - I don't remember that on Ingen's list. - Because it wasn't on their list. And it makes you wonder what else they were up to. So, Mr. Kirby, tell me. When you climbed K2... ...did you base camp at 25,000 or 30,000 feet? 30,000 feet. We were pretty close to the top. You were about 1,000 feet above it, actually. No, that's a common mistake. There's no such thing as Kirby Enterprises, is there? It's Kirby Paint and Tile Plus. The ""Plus"" stands for bathroom fixtures. We're in the Westgate Shopping Centre, Enid, Oklahoma... I don't suppose that cheque you wrote us is any good. - I will pay you the money I owe you. - This is good. Here we are, in the worst place in the world, and we're not being paid! Wait, fellas. Hold on! I'll make this up to you. If you ever do a bathroom or a kitchen... - You're not a mercenary, are you? - I never said I was. That's true. What are you? I'm like a booking agent. One of the guys got sick and couldn't come. Excuse me. Here. - So you run a hardware store? - Paint and tile, yeah. - You never can tell about people, can you? - Ain't that the truth? - Eric! - Quiet. Would you stop that? Dr. Grant says this is very dangerous territory. Maybe we should split up. - We could cover twice as much. - Dr. Grant says that's a bad idea. Dr. Grant says this... Why hire an expert if we don't use his advice? Except Dr. Grant isn't looking for Eric. - He's looking for the coast. - Go ahead and scream. When that ""Tricycloplots"" attacks you, don't come crying to me. - Don't worry about that. - What? What did you say? - What did you say? - Never mind! Paul, just drop it! If we split up, I'm going with you guys. - Eric! - Eric! - Mrs. Kirby! Mrs. Kirby! - Eric! Mrs. Kirby, the chances are remote they're still in the vicinity. Young adult. Hey, guys! That's my camera. The battery's dead. I've got an idea. Let me have the camera. Where were you on that one, Ma? Okay, dive. Dive. Come on, Ma. - Eric. - Ma, you were supposed to catch itl I shot this the morning they disappeared. I want that. Let me take that. Come on, give me that. Come on, baby. See anything yet? No, not yet! What was that? Unclip us. - There's a big clip! - I can't see. I can't do it! I'm going to unhook you, all right? One, two, three! Are you okay, buddy? I'm gonna drop myself down now. The camera's still on. He's alive. I know he's alive. We're gonna find him. Can you fly one of those? Maybe. As long as the sail is not torn. Well, let's take it. If we spot a plane, it might be a good way to get attention. Pull it over this way. I got it, hold on! Okay. Okay. My God! Okay, you're free. Get her back, Mr. Kirby! Amanda! Wait! Amanda! Amanda, stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about Ben. It's not Ben, Paul. It's Eric. He's out there all by himself. I know, I know. Our baby is out here all by himself. Listen to me. We'll find him. I promise. Paul. Dr. Grant! You should come look at this! Raptor. We're going to find him. Are you listening to me? We're going to find him. Kid's got resources. Remember what it was like to try to ground him? Where's Billy? What are you doing? I was photographing the nest. Don't do that again. I'm sorry. If I lose you, it's just me and the damn tourists. I bet you Eric is in there. Don't you think? I'd bet my bottom dollar! What do you think it is? As far as I'm concerned, it's the Four Seasons. - Eric! - Paul! Don't. What the hell. Who's got some change? It only takes quarters. I've got $1.10. This is how you make dinosaurs? No. This is how you play God. This way! It's locked! - This way, this way! - Go! Go! Hey, over here! Push, push! My God. He's calling for help. Come on! Into the herd! Head for the trees! Udesky. Mr. Kirby! - Billy? - ls Alan with you? Oh, my God. Mr. Udesky! He's dead. Oh, my God. No, he's not. No, wait. Something's not right. We've got to help him. Amanda! Hold on! They set a trap. They actually set a trap. What are you saying? What are you looking for? Wait! Thanks. Thanks a lot, Eric. You know who I am? Yeah. Your parents are here. They're looking for you. Together? Together. That's not good. They don't do so well together. You'd be surprised what people can do... ...when they have to. You're Alan Grant. What are you doing here? Your parents... ...invited me along. I read both of your books. I liked the first one more. Before you were on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then. Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me yet. When Ingen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind. Any weapons? No, and I just used the last of the gas grenades. And I appreciate that. Be careful with that. T-Rex. It scares the smaller ones away... ...but it attracts one really big one with a fin. This is T-Rex pee? How did you get it? You don't want to know. - Dessert? - Sure. I have to tell you, I'm astonished you've lasted eight weeks on this island. Is that all it's been? You're alive and that's the important thing. Thanks to you, that's one thing we have in common. Did you read Malcolm's book? Yeah. So? I don't know. I mean... It was kind of preachy. And too much chaos. Everything is chaos. Seemed like he was high on himself. That's two things that we have in common. Listen. Compys! Alan! Alan! Alan! No matter how this turns out... ...it wasn't your fault. Eric's always been a strong-willed kid. Always. Then you throw someone like Ben Hildebrand into the mix... ...and... ...well. Well, what? All I'm saying is, it's not your fault. No. If he'd been with you, he'd be completely safe. You drive five miles under the speed limit. And I've totalled three cars in three years. Well, not three. The Buick wasn't really totalled. I just said it was, because I wanted to get the S.U.V. I am so sorry that you have to be here. I'm not. There's a boat, right alongside the bank. - Looks in good shape. - A rescue boat? No, no. Just something left behind. But it floats. We stick to the plan. Head for the coast. You're not gonna look for Dr. Grant? The coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that's where he's headed. I agree. What about Eric? Eric's a smart kid. He probably knows his best chance is by the coast. He figures the big dinosaurs are in the centre of the island. Right? Sure. You know what this is? It's a Raptor claw. I used to have one. A fossil. Mine is new. How much of the island did you explore? I stayed pretty close to the compound. I figured if anyone came looking for me, that's where they'd start. We need to get to the coast. That was the plan. Are you sure? The closer you get to water, the bigger things get. If we can find our way down into the canyon... ...we can follow that river out to the coast. After we find your parents. Then what? - One step at a time. - Listen. What? That's my dad's satellite phone! Wait a minute. How do you know? ""Kirby Paint and Tile Plus, in Westgate!"" Dad! Mum! Mum! Dad! - Eric! - Eric! Eric! This way! Mum! Dad! Eric! Mum, Dad! Mum, Dad! I knew it. My God. I knew it. Oh, God. Boy, am I glad to see you. Hey, you got my bag. Yeah. Lucky strap. Want me to carry it? We need to find a gap here. - How did you know we were here? - The phone. That stupid jingle from the store. I heard it. - My phone? - Your satellite phone. - Where is it? - I don't have it. - When did you use it last? - On the plane. I got a call on the plane and... - What? - I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it when he... Run. Alan, you want to give me the bag back? It's okay, I got it. Please, give me the bag. It's not safe. Raptor eggs. Did you steal Raptor eggs? Now it all makes sense. I swear, if I'd known you were going to end up with them... It was an impulse, I thought they'd be worth a fortune. Enough to fund the dig site another 10 more years. You have to believe me. This was a stupid decision, but I did it with the best intentions. ""With the best intentions."" Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You know what, Billy? As far as I'm concerned... ...you're no better than the people that built this place. What are you doing? Those things are after us because of those. Those things know we have the eggs. If I drop them in the river, they'll still be after us. - What if they catch us with them? - What if they catch us without them? There's a boat at the bottom, just downriver. We can try and make it to the coast, at least. - You okay? - Yeah. Let's do this one at a time, shall we? Okay, come on over! One at a time! All right, Eric. I'm going to leave you just for a minute. And then you'll be right behind me, okay? Mum! I've been alone in a water truck for eight weeks. I think I can manage the next two minutes without you. Right, we're all together now. Okay, Eric. - Okay. - Come on, honey! Over you go. Mum? Oh, my God. - What is it? - It's a birdcage. For what? Dad! Eric! Eric! Eric! I can't see him! Eric! No! This way! Billy? Billy! Billy, stop!  Don't, Billy! Billy! Eric, hold on! Eric! Jump! Billy! Let go now! - Eric! - He's there. Eric! There he is! He's across the river! Get him out of here! - No! - Go, Eric! What about Billy? Hang on, Billy! Wait. Get away! There's plenty of gasoline. Now we've just got to make our way to the coast. Work out some sort of a signal. Build a fire or something. Something they can see from the air. Dr. Grant? Hey, Eric, how are you doing? I'm sorry about Billy. You know what the last thing I said to him was? I said: ""You're as bad as the people that built this place."" Which wasn't true. Billy was just young. That's all. I have a theory that there are two kinds of boys. There are those who want to be astronomers... ...and those who want to be astronauts. The astronomer, or the paleontologist... ...gets to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. - But then you never get to go into space. - Exactly. It's the difference between imagining and seeing. To be able to touch them. And that's all Billy wanted. Dr. Grant. You know something, Dr. Grant? Billy was right. Listen. Find it before it stops! Eric, you stay on that boat. It's here. It's here. God. I got it. Hello? Hello? You too can own a timeshare... ...in beautiful Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four-star restaurants. Look out! Turn off the power. You've got juice for maybe one call. Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a damn thing. Hey, guys, come here!  Look at this! - Bonitos. - Something must have spooked them! Get the engine going, Mr. Kirby. Open the throttle! Pick up. Hello? Ellie? Hello? Charlie! - Charlie! - Hello? Charlie, take the phone to Mummy now! Take the phone to Mummy! It's the dinosaur man! - Okay. - Listen to me, Charlie. Charlie! Are you taking the phone to Mum? Charlie! Oh, ho-ho! Hi, everybody! It's great to be here! Hi, there! How are you? This is going to be great. - Who's on the phone? - The dinosaur man. He is? Alan? Look in the boxes! Find a weapon! Where's the phone? - There! - Get the phone! Ellie, listen to me! Are you on a cell phone? I can't hear you. The river! Site B! The river! Hello? Hey! Dad! Dad! Paul! Dad! Paul, you jerk! You can't leave me like this! I'm not going anywhere! Remember when we went fishing a couple of summers ago? I was putting the boat in the water and the trailer sank? The tow truck tried to pull us out and it got dragged in, too. The truck driver wanted to knock my lights out. I miss fishing. Mr. Kirby? That lady you called. Who is she? How do you know that she can help us? She's the one person I could always count on. I owe her a lot. - I don't think I ever told her that. - You should. You hear that? The ocean. They want the eggs. Otherwise, we'd be dead already. Everybody get down. She's challenging us. She thinks you stole the eggs. Get behind me. Give me the eggs. Do it, Mum. No. Call for help. That's a helicopter. Dr. Grant? - Dr. Alan Grant? - Stop! That's a very bad idea! - Second squad, move! - Wow! You have to thank her now. She sent the Navy and the Marines. God bless you, Ellie. - Dr. Grant, is this man with you? - What? You made it. Yeah. I rescued your hat. - Dr. Grant, we need to go now! - Oh, yeah. Well, that's the important thing. Dr. Grant! Can I get you to sit here and buckle up, sir? Sea Shadow to Dust Storm, six souls on board. Dust Storm to Sea Shadow, roger. What the hell is that? Dr. Grant, look! Where do you think they're going? I don't know. Maybe just looking for new nesting grounds. It's a whole new world for them. I dare them to nest in Enid, Oklahoma. Let's go home., Before time began, there was the Cube. We know not where it comes from, only that it holds the power to create worlds and fill them with life. That is how our race was born. For a time, we lived in harmony, but like all great power, some wanted it for good, others for evil. And so began the war, a war that ravaged our planet until it was consumed by death, and the Cube was lost to the far reaches of space. We scattered across the galaxy, hoping to find it and rebuild our home, searching every star, every world. And just when all hope seemed lost, message of a new discovery drew us to an unknown planet called Earth. But we were already too late. Oh, God, five months of this. I can't wait to get a little taste of home. A plate of mama's alligators touffe. You've been talking about barbecued 'gators and crickets for the last two weeks. I'm never going to your mama's house, Fig. I promise. But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known to have the most succulent meat. I understand. English, please. English. I mean, how many times have we... We don't speak Spanish. I told you that. Why you got to ruin it for me, man? That's my heritage. Go with the Spanish. Whatever. Hey, you guys remember weekends? Huh? The Sox at Fenway. - Cold hotdog and a flat beer. - Perfect day. What about you, Captain? You got a perfect day? I just can't wait to hold my baby girl for the first time. - He's adorable. - That's too... Shut up! Hey, I'm ready to do this. Hey, any of y'all grow some balls, come see me on the court, man. Hey, hey! Watch this crossover, baby. Like Jordan in his prime, pushing through the front line. - Step aside, ladies. - Oh, man. What? - Lennox! - Hey, what are you doing? - Water? - Thank you. Are you gonna help me with the gear? Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out. Unidentified aircraft, you are in restricted US military airspace. Squawk ident and proceed east out of the area. Raptors one and two, snap to heading two-five-zero to intercept. Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out, not squawking. Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you to US SOCCENT airbase. If you do not comply, we will use deadly force. Copy the bogie. Tail 4500 X-ray. Sir, says here 4500 X was shot down three months ago. - Afghanistan. - That's got to be a mistake. - Check again, then recheck. - I did, sir. A friend of mine was on that chopper. Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you to US SOCCENT airbase. - Radar, where's the inbound? - Bogie's five miles out, sir. - My wife on? - Yes, Captain. - My ladies! - Look. Oh, my goodness. Look at her. She's getting so big. Look at those cheeks. I just wanna chew on them. Baby, we made a good-looking kid. I know that people say that all the time, but, wow, we made one good-looking kid. Nice work. She has your laugh. - She laughed? - Her first one, yeah. You sure she didn't just fart? No, she's a lady. She doesn't know you yet, but she will. 4500 X. Something's not right. Bogie's on the deck. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed. It's coming from the chopper. - Will? - Sarah? Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me, I love you and I'll be home soon. Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me, I love you and I'll be home soon. - To the right. Go to the right. - Check fire. MH-53 pilot, power down now. Have your crew step out or we will kill you. Hold your fire! Stand by to engage! My God. They bombed the antenna farm! We're under attack! Go! Move! Move! It's going after the files! Cut the hard lines! I need a key! It's locked! Move! Move! Here, come here! Come here! Here, hide in here! Oh, my God. Okay. No! Oh! What the... Epps, let's go! Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up. Sorry, I got a lot of stuff. Watch. Okay. For my family... Who did... Who did that? People! Responsibility. Okay. So, for my family genealogy report, I decided to do it on my great-great-grandfather, who was a famous man, Captain Archibald Witwicky. Very famous explorer. In fact, he was one of the first to explore the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal. In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors straight into the Arctic Shelf. Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave! The ice is freezing faster than it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men! Heave! No sacrifice, no victory! We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads! So that's the story, right? And here we have some of the basic instruments and tools used by 19th-century seamen. This here is the quadrant, which you can get for 80 bucks. It's all for sale, by the way. Like the sextant here. $50 for this, which is a bargain. These are pretty cool. These are my grandfather's glasses. I haven't quite gotten them appraised yet, but they've seen many cool things. Are you going to sell me his liver? Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell. It's the 11th grade. I don't think your grandfather would be particularly proud of what you're doing. I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know, this is all going towards my car fund. You can tell your folks. It's on eBay. I take PayPal. Cold hard cash works, too. And the compass makes a great gift for Columbus Day. - Sam! - Sorry. Unfortunately, my great-great-grandfather, the genius that he was, wound up going blind and crazy in a psycho ward, drawing these strange symbols and babbling on about some giant ice man that he thought he'd discovered. Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow. Might not. - Sleep in fear tonight. - Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30? - Sam? - Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Okay. Pretty good, right? I'd say a solid B-. A B-? You were hawking your great-grandfather's crap - in my classroom. - No, kids enjoy... - Look, can you do me a favor? - What? Can you look out the window for a second? You see my father? - He's the guy in the green car. - Yeah. Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream. A boy's dream. And a man's promise to that boy. He looked at me in the eye. He said, ""Son, I'm gonna buy you a car. ""But I want you to bring me $2,000 and three As."" Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As. Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-. Dream gone. Kaput. Sir, just ask yourself, what would Jesus do? Yes! Yes, yes. So? A-. It's an A, though. Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A. - So I'm good? - You're good. - I got a little surprise for you, son. - What kind of... Yeah, a little surprise. No. No, no, no, no. Dad! - Oh, you got to be kidding me. - See? Yeah. I am. You're not getting a Porsche. - You think that's funny? - Yeah, I think it's funny. - What's wrong with you? - You think I'd really get you a Porsche for your first car? I don't want to talk to you for the rest of this whole thing. - Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke. - It's not a funny joke. - Manny! - What? Get your cousin out of that damn clown suit. He's having a heat stroke again. Scaring white folks. I'm hot! Makeup's melting. It hurts my eyes. Here? No, no, no, what is this? You said... You said half a car, not half a piece of crap, Dad. When I was your age, I'd have been happy with four wheels and an engine. Okay, let me explain something to you. Okay? - You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin? - Yeah. Okay, that's what this is. And this is 50-year-old virgin. - Okay. - You want me to live that life? - No sacrifice, no victory. - Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it. - The old Witwicky motto, Dad. - Right. Gentlemen. Bobby Bolivia, like the country, except without the runs. How can I help you? Well, my son here, looking to buy his first car. - You come to see me? - I had to. That practically makes us family. Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B. - Sam. - Sam, let me talk to you. Sam, your first enchilada of freedom awaits underneath one of those hoods. Let me tell you something, son. A driver don't pick the car. The car'll pick the driver. It's a mystical bond between man and machine. Son, I'm a lot of things, but a liar's not one of them. Especially not in front of my mammy. That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy! Don't be like that. If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch. I tell you, man, she deaf, you know? Well, over here, every piece of car a man might want or need. This ain't bad. - This one's got racing stripes. - Yeah. It got racing... Yeah, what's this? What the heck is this? I don't know nothing about this car. - Manny! - What? What is this? This car! Check it out! I don't know, boss! I've never seen it! That's loco! Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny! Find out! Feels good. - How much? - Well, considering the semi-classic nature of the vehicle, with the slick wheels and the custom paint job... - Yeah, but the paint's faded. - Yeah, but it's custom. It's custom faded? Well, this is your first car. I wouldn't expect you to understand. - Five grand. - No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry. Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car. No, no, no. You said cars pick their drivers. Well, sometimes they pick a driver with a cheap-ass father. Out the car. Now, this one here for four Gs is a beaut. There's a Fiesta with racing stripes over there. No, I don't want a Fiesta with racing stripes. This is a classic engine right here. I sold a car the other day... Gee. Holy cow. - No, no, no. No worries. - You all right? I'll get a sledgehammer and knock this right out. Hey, hey, Manny! Get your clown cousin and get some hammers and come bang this stuff out, baby! ... greater than man... That one's my favorite, drove all the way from Alabammy. Steve. Hello, Mr. Secretary. They're so young. They're the top subject matter experts, sir. NSA's recruiting right out of high school these days. Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense. I am so underdressed. Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary of Defense. Please be seated. I'm John Keller. Obviously, you're wondering why you're here, so these are the facts. At 1900 local time yesterday, the SOCCENT Forward Operations Base in Qatar was attacked. So far as we know, there were no survivors. The objective of the attack was to hack our military network. We're not sure exactly what they're after, but we do know that they were cut off during the assault, which would lead us to assume that they're going to try it again. Now, no one's taken responsibility for the attack. And the only real lead we have so far is this sound. That's the signal that hacked our network. NSA's working at full capacity to analyze it and intercept further communications, but we need your help to find out who did this. Now, you've all shown considerable ability in the area of signals analysis. We're on a hair-trigger here, people. The President has dispatched battle groups to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea. This is as real as it's ever gonna get. Now I'm gonna leave you to your officer-in-charge. You'll break up into teams and you'll start your work. Good luck to us all. All right, Mojo. I got the car. Now I need the girl. I need money to take out the girl is what I need. Zero bids. Great. Broke. Come on, Mojo. You want your pain pills? No. Premature. Good. What's up? Nothing. You know, just driving my car. Driving my car. It's like clockwork. All right, I know you get wasted on these things, but if you piss in my bed again, you're sleeping outside. Okay? That's it for today. No more. Crackhead. - Ron, this one is uneven. - Yeah. Probably. This one is wobbly. - Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon. - Couldn't we have hired a professional? - Sam... - What? I do not like footprints on my grass. - What foot... There's no footprints. - That's why I built my path. So why don't you go from my grass onto my path, okay? - It's family grass, Dad. - Well, when you own your own grass, - you'll understand. - This... I can't do it anymore. - You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog. - What? He's got enough self-esteem issues as a Chihuahua, Mom. That's his bling. I want you home at 11:00! - Yeah, all right. Please, for the love of God, drive safely. Seat belt on! Wow. You are so cheap. Well, it's his first car. Supposed to be like that. At this time, we can't confirm whether there were any survivors. Oh, my God. Our bases worldwide are, as of now, at DEFCON Delta, our highest readiness level. We're dealing with a very effective weapons system that we have not come across before. But our prayers are with the families of the brave men and women... Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay. I've never seen a weapons system like this. The thermal shows this weird aura around the exoskeleton like it's cloaked by some kind of invisible force field. That's impossible. There's no such thing as invisible force fields except in, like, comic book stuff, right? - Man, I don't know. - What is that? My mama, she had the gift, you know? She saw things. I got the gene, too, and that thing that attacked us? I got a feeling it ain't over. How about you use those magic voodoo powers and get us the hell out of here, huh? When I took that picture, I think it saw me. It looked right at me. All right, we got to get this thing back to the Pentagon right away. They got to know what we're dealing with here. My radio's fried. - I got no communication with aerial. - Hey, Mahfouz. - How far do you live from here? - Not far. Just up that mountain. - Do they have a phone? - Yes. All right, let's hit it. Dude, are you sure we're invited to this party? Of course, Miles. It's a lake. Public property. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here. Just don't do anything weird, all right? - I'm good, right? - Yeah, you're good. Okay. Hey, guys, check it out. Oh, hi. Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey. So, what are you guys doing here? We're here to climb this tree. I see that. It looks... It looks fun. - Yeah. - You know, I thought I recognized you. You tried out for the football team last year, right? Let's go call your mom. Oh, no, no, that... No. That wasn't like a real tryout. I was researching a book I was writing. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Yeah? What's it about? Sucking at sports? No, it's about the link between brain damage and football. No, it's a good book. Your friends'll love it. You know, it's got mazes in it and, you know, little coloring areas, sections, pop-up pictures. It's a lot of fun. That's funny. Okay, okay. You know what? Stop. Hey, guys, I know of a party. Let's go, let's head. You got to get out of the tree right now. Get... Just get out of the tree right now, please. What are you doing? Did you see that dismount? All the chicks were watching. You're making me look like an idiot. We both looked like idiots just now. - Hey, how about you let me drive? - Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy. These 22s, I don't want you grinding them. No. Why doesn't my little bunny just hop in the back seat? God, I can't even tell you how much I'm not your little bunny. Okay. You'll call me. Who's gonna drive you home, tonight? Hey, man, what's wrong with your radio? - I'm gonna drive her home tonight. - What? She's an evil jock concubine, man. Let her hitchhike. She lives 10 miles from here, okay? It's my only chance. You got to be understanding here, all right? All right. We'll put her in the back. I'll be quiet. - Did you say, ""Put her in the back""? - I called shotgun. I'm not putting her in the back. You got to get out of my car. - That's a party foul. - What rules? Bros before hos. Miles, I'm begging you to get out of my car. Okay? You can't do this to me. You got to get out of my car right now. Who's gonna come around when you break? Mikaela! It's Sam. Witwicky. I hope I didn't get you stranded or anything. You sure? So, listen, I was wondering if I could ride you home. I mean, give you a ride home in my car, to your house. There you go. So... I can't believe that I'm here right now. You can duck down if you want. I mean, it won't hurt my feelings. Oh, no, no, no. I didn't mean here with you. I just meant here, like, in this situation, this same situation that I'm always in. 'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just have a weakness for hot guys, for tight abs and really big arms. Big arms? Well, there's a couple new additions in the car. Like, I just put in that light there. And that disco ball. And so the light reflects off the disco ball. Yeah. Are you new to school this year? It's your first year here? Oh, no, no. We've been in the same school since first grade. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, a long time. Well, do we have any classes together? - Yeah, yeah. - Really? Which? History. Language arts. Math. Science. - Sam. - Sam. Yeah. - Sam Wilkicky. - Witwicky. God, you know what? I'm so sorry. I just... - No, it's cool. - I just didn't recognize you. Yeah, well, I mean, that's understandable. No, no, no. No. Come on. Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks. You know, it's a new car. When I get that feeling I want sexual healing This radio is, like, you know... It's an old radio, too, so... Sexual healing Look, this isn't something that I, you know... I can't get this radio to stop. Look, I wouldn't try this on you. 'Cause this is like a romantic thing that I'm not trying to do. Not that you're not worthy of trying something like this on. - No, of course not. - I'm a friend of yours. I'm not a romantic friend. Romantic friends do this. I mean, I'm not that friend. I mean, we... I could be. I feel good Just pop the hood. Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up. Whoa, nice headers. You've got a high-rise double-pump carburetor. That's pretty impressive, Sam. Double-pump? It squirts the fuel in so you can go faster. I like to go faster. And it looks like your distributor cap's a little loose. Yeah? How'd you know that? My dad. He was a real grease monkey. He taught me all about this. I could take it all apart, clean it, put it back together. That's weird. I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical. Oh, my God. Well, you know, I don't really broadcast it. Guys don't like it when you know more about cars than they do. Especially not Trent. He hates it. Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know, females working on my engine. I prefer it, actually. - Okay. You want to fire it up for me? - Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem. - Thanks. - You know, I was thinking. You know, if Trent's such a jerk, why do you hang out with him? You know what? I'm just... I'm gonna walk. Good luck with your car. All right. Walking's healthy, right? Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, please. Please, you gotta work for me now. Don't let her walk away. Come on, come on, come on. Please, please. Baby come back any kind of fool could see Hey! There was something in everything about you Baby come back you can blame it all on me Hey! Wait a second! I was wrong and I just can't live without you There it is. I had fun. So, you know, thanks for listening. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - You... You think I'm shallow? I think you're... No, no, no. I think there's a lot more than meets the eye with you. Okay. Yeah. All right, I'll see you at school. All right. That's stupid. That was a stupid line. ""There's more than meets the eye with you."" Stupid. Oh, God. Oh, my God. I love my car. Hey, guys, I think the other team figured it out. Iran. Come on, man. This is way too smart for Iranian scientists. - Think about it. - What do you think, kid? Chinese? No way. This is nothing like what the Chinese are using. This is Air Force One. Level of flight, level three-three-zero. We will hunt down this enemy. And when we do, we'll know just what to do with them. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Apparently, there are very few survivors. Yes, Mr. President? Yeah, can you wrangle me up some Ding Dongs, darling? I joined the Air Force to bring the man Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage. Shoot. Gross. Do you hear that? Are you getting this? I think they're hacking the network again. Oh, my God. This is a direct match to the signal in Qatar. - Are you running a diagnostic? - Should I be? - Yes, you should. - So I am. Someone! They're hacking into Air Force One! We need a senior analyst. - I think they're planting a virus. - A virus? - It's streaming right now. - They are planting a virus and stealing a whole lot of data from your system at the same time. Code Red. We have a breach. Air Force One, someone onboard has breached the military network. I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear. - You got to cut the hard lines. - What? - Whatever they want, they are getting it. - Sir? Permission to take down the Defense Network. - Cut all server hard lines now. - Cut all server hard lines now. Someone's tampered with the POTUS mainframe. What the... Shots fired in the underdeck. Repeat, shots fired. Crew, prepare for emergency descent. I want our President in that bunker. And I don't want to discuss a damn thing other till that becomes reality. That's our first priority. That's our only priority right now. Air Force One is on the ground. Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! That's my car! No! No, no, no, no. Dad, call the cops! Where you going with my car, buddy? Where you going? Hello? 911 emergency! My car has been stolen! I'm in pursuit! Right? I need all units, the whole squadron. Bring everyone! No, don't ask me questions, all right? My father's the head of the neighborhood watch! Oh, my God. My name is Sam Witwicky. Whoever finds this, my car is alive, okay? You saw that? Since this is my last words on Earth, I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you, and if you find Busty Beauties under my bed, it wasn't mine. I'm holding it for Miles. No, no, wait that... Okay, that's not true. It's mine and Uncle Charles gave it to me. I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you. No! No! No! No! Oh, my God. No, you're a good dog! Good dog! Good dog! Oh, my God. Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh! No! No! Okay. Please, please don't kill me! I'm sorry! Take the keys! I don't want them! Car's yours! Listen, listen, listen. - Good, you're here. - Let me see your hands! - No, no, no! It's not me! - Let me see your hands. - The guy's inside. - Shut up! Walk towards the car. Put your head on the hood. Whoever did this finally managed to infiltrate our defense network, which is what they tried to do in Qatar, only this time it worked. - What did they get? - We still don't know. - Talk to me about the virus. - It's a Spider-bot virus. We're not sure what it's going to do, but it may cripple the system. - Can we stop it? - Every time we try an antivirus, it adapts and speeds up. It's like it's not a virus anymore. It's become the system. Obviously the first phase of a major attack against the US. The only countries with this kind of capability are Russia, North Korea, maybe China. - I'm sorry, that's not correct. - Excuse me, young lady. I didn't see you standing there. You would be who? I'm just the analyst who detected the hack. Hold on. It was you? You did it? - Her team. - Sir, I was just trying to say, they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds. Okay. Even a supercomputer with a brute force attack would take 20 years to do that. Maybe you can explain, then, how our latest satellite imagery shows North Korea doubling its naval activity. Maybe it's a precaution, because isn't that what we're doing? The signal pattern is learning. It's evolving on its own. And you need to move past Fourier transfers and start considering quantum mechanics. There is nothing on Earth that complex. What about an organism? A living organism? Maybe some kind of DNA-based computer? - And I know that that sounds crazy... - That's enough. That's enough. We have six floors of analysts working on this thing. Now, if you can find proof to back up your theory, I'm gonna be happy to listen to you. But if you don't get a filter on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna be off the team. You understand? Look, I can't be any clearer than how crystal clear I am being. - It just stood up. - It just stood up. Wow. That's really neat. Okay, chiefie. Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy. What are you rolling? Whippets? Goofballs? A little wowie sauce with the boys? - No, I'm not on any drugs. - What's these? Found it in your pocket. ""Mojo."" Is that what the kids are doing now? Little bit of Mojo? - Those are my dog's pain pills. - You know, a Chihuahua. A little... What was that? You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent? You wanna go? Make something happen. Do it. 'Cause I promise you I will bust you up. Are you on drugs? Let's hope this telephone line works. Hey, heads up! Heads up! Hey! Heads up! What the heck was that? English, dude. English. Whoa! Watch out! - Open fire! - Contact! Contact! Everybody, quiet. Settle. Whoa, mother... What the hell is... Get up! Get up! Come on! Go! Move it! Take cover! Fig! Cover the rear! Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear! Epps! Cover the rear! Move it! Come on! Give me a mag! Where's your papa? Where's your papa? Papa! Sir, we need... I need a telephone. - Telephone, telephone, yes! - Telephone! Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag! - Cell phone! - I don't know how to thank you. Fire! This is an emergency Pentagon call! I need you to... Do you understand? It's an emergency Pentagon... I don't have a credit card! Sir, the attitude is not going to speed things up any bit at all. I'm going to ask you to speak into the mouthpiece very clearly. I'm in the middle of a war! This is frigging ridiculous! Ammo! I need a credit card! - Epps! Where's your wallet? - Pocket! - Which pocket? - My back pocket! - You got 10 back pockets! - Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek! All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting! Okay, it's Visa. Also, sir, have you heard about our premium plus world-service gold package? No, I don't want a premium package! Epps! Pentagon! Give me a status. Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team under fire in Qatar. They say they're survivors of the base attack. Survivors? I ain't never seen this in my life! Need gunships on station ASAP! Predator's coming up in a minute. We're linking the call to the nearest AWACS. Unknown, man. I don't... Man, if you seen this shit... Predator ETA two minutes. Hey! Make way! - What is that? - I don't know. We need air support and we need it now. Roll in strike package Bravo on unknown target. I authenticate Tango Whiskey at time 0300 Zulu. Attention, all aircraft. This will be a danger close-fire mission. Weapons, I just got a call from Falcon Ops. Who's closer to Kill Box One Alpha? - Send the Hogs, sir. - Okay, send the Hogs over to Kill Box One Alpha. It's a danger close... Switch the Hogs to Kill Box One Alpha, 300 feet danger close. Friendlies in the area. Seven-man team north of orange smoke! Received Kill Box One Alpha. Engage hostile. Attack direction west! You're clear and hot! Strike, tell me status of Hog right now. Hog One-One Dark Star status. - Lennox! The heat's coming! - Laze the target! We got a beam-rider incoming! Laze target! - Ready! Heat's coming! - What? Bring it! Receiving radar jamming in vicinity of target. No frigging way that thing's still not down. Spooky Three Two, use 105 shells. Bring the rain. Be advised, ground team is requesting 105 sabot rounds. Did we lose them? Warthog One confirm visual on friendlies. Where's Fig? - Fig? Fig? - Oh, God! - God damn it! - Get a medic! Get a medic! - I'm sorry. - Black Hawk... We'll get a medic. Just hold on. He's got a pulse. We need a medevac. One man down. Patient care category urgent. Bring them home. You get those men stateside right now. I want them debriefed in 10 hours. There's only one hacker in the world who can break this code. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop! I am sorry to bother you. - Maggie? - Listen, I need your help. No! This is my private area, my place of Zen and peace. - Listen to me. - Glen! Who is it? Shut up, Grandma! - What are you doing here? - Just give me a break, will you, please? Grandmama! Drink your prune juice! - What level are you on, man? - Six. Oh, here come the matrix! Here come the matrix! Glen, seriously, don't you want to see something classified? Yeah. Get low. - Here we go. Here we go. Double tap. - Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it. Hey. I need a moment. - Please. - Sorry. Hey, man, save my game. How classified? Like ""I will go to jail for the rest of my life for showing you"" classified. Yes! One quick peek. Special Ops got a thermal snapshot of whatever hit the base in Qatar. - I want to see it. - Well, the imager was damaged, sir. The rangers are en route with the imager, but we also have a security issue. Circle logs indicate one of the analysts made a copy of the network intrusion signal. The signal strength is through the roof. Where did you say you got this? It hacked the national military air-guard frequency in less than a minute. - No way. - Yeah. Looks like there's a message embedded in the signal. Let me work my magic. ""Project Iceman""? - What's Sector Seven? - Who is Captain Witwicky? Are you playing those video games again? Cops! Cops! FBI! Clear right! Lock it down! Lock it down! Cops! Lock it down. Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a... Get off my Grandmama's carpet! She don't like nobody on the carpet! Especially police! It was an awesome spectacle here an hour ago when over 40 C-17 s lifted off of this very base. We're not told where they're going. Morning, Mo. The government has been very quiet about what's going on but in our... - Mojo. Mojo. - They were headed directly towards North Korea. Stop with the barking, Mojo. It's too early. Please? Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen. - My car, it stole itself, okay? - What are you talking about, man? Satan's Camaro. In my yard. It's stalking me. Stop! No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, my God! Sam? Hi. That was... That was really awesome. - Well, it felt awesome. - Are you okay? I'm not okay, all right? I'm losing my mind a little bit. I'm getting chased by my car right now. I got to go. You know what? I'm gonna catch up with you guys later. Oh, great. Cops. Officer! Listen! Oh, that hurt. Listen to me! Thank God you're here! I've had the worst day ever! I've been... I've been followed here on my mother's bike! Right? And my car's right there and it's been following me here! So get out of the car! No! Stop! Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right! Okay! I'm sorry! I'm... I didn't mean to hit your car! Look! Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop! Please! Okay, what do you want from me? Okay. Oh, God, no! No! Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit! Oh, God! Oh, shit! It's a bad dream. Are you username LadiesMan217? I don't know what you're talking about! Are you username LadiesMan217? Yeah. Where is eBay item 21153? Where are the glasses? Get back! Stop! God! What is your problem, Sam? Okay, there's a monster right there! It just attacked me! Here he comes! All right, get up. Get up and run! You have to run! Okay. Sam, what is that thing? - You have to get in the car. Get in. - I don't want to. - Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me! - Sam. Get in! Go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go! Oh, God! We're gonna die! We're gonna die! No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die. - Oh, my God! - Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver! Oh, my God! No! We're gonna die! Oh, my God! We're locked in. The car won't start. At least we ditched the monster, right? Okay. Time to start. He's got me! Oh, God! He's going to kill me! No. No, no, no! Get off! Kill it! Kill it! Get it, get it, get it, get it! Not so tough without a head, are you? Here, come on. What is it? It's a robot. But like a... Like a different... You know, like a super-advanced robot. It's probably Japanese. Yeah, it's definitely Japanese. What are you doing? I don't think it wants to hurt us. It would have done that already. Really? Well, do you speak robot? Because they just had, like, a giant droid death match. - I think it wants something from me. - What? Well, 'cause the other one was talking about my eBay page. You are the strangest boy I have ever met. - Can you talk? - XM Satellite Radio... Digital cable brings you... ... Columbia Broadcasting System... So you... You talk through the radio? Thank you, you're beautiful. You're wonderful, you're wonderful. So, what was that last night? What was that? Message from Starfleet, Captain... Throughout the inanimate vastness of space... Angels will rain down like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah! Visitors from heaven? What... What are you, like, an alien or something? Any more questions you want to ask? He wants us to get in the car. And go where? Fifty years from now, when you're looking back at your life, don't you want to be able to say you had the guts to get in the car? This car's a pretty good driver. I know. Why don't you go sit in that seat, there? I'm not going to sit in that seat. He's driving. Yeah. You're right. - Well, maybe you should sit in my lap. - Why? Well, I have the only seat belt here. You know, safety first. - Yeah, all right. - Right? - Yeah. - Okay. There, see? That's better. - Okay. - Okay. You know, that seat belt thing was a pretty smooth move. Thank you. You know what I don't understand? Why, if he's supposed to be, like, this super-advanced robot, does he transform back into this piece-of-crap Camaro? Whoa! Whoa! Oh, see? No. Get... No, that doesn't work. See? Move it, you moron! Great, now... See? Fantastic. Now you pissed him off. That car is sensitive. I mean, $4000 just drove off. What? This is you... Oh, my God! Come on, let's go. This is the coolest thing I've ever seen! Explosions everywhere! This is easily a hundred times cooler than Armageddon. I swear to God! Fire, fire, fire, fire! Whoa! Sweet! Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got asteroid insurance, 'cause he is so boned! What is that? There's something in the tree, dude. No, there's something in the thing by the tree! Could you guys just give me a space rock? Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy? Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing out here by yourself? Holy God! What happened to the pool? Are you Samuel James Witwicky, descendent of Archibald Witwicky? They know your name. They know your name. Yeah. My name is Optimus Prime. We are autonomous robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron. - But you can call us Autobots for short. - Autobots. - What's cracking, little bitches? - My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz. This looks like a cool place to kick it. What is that? How did he learn to talk like that? We've learned Earth's languages through the World Wide Web. My weapons specialist, Ironhide. - You feeling lucky, punk? - Easy, Ironhide. Just kidding. I just wanted to show him my cannons. Our medical officer, Ratchet. The boy's pheromone level suggests he wants to mate with the female. You already know your guardian, Bumblebee. Bumblebee, right? Check on the rep Yep, second to none So you're my guardian, huh? His vocal processors were damaged in battle. I'm still working on them. Why are you here? We are here looking for the All Spark. And we must find it before Megatron. Mega-what? Our planet was once a powerful empire, peaceful and just, until we were betrayed by Megatron, leader of the Decepticons. All who defied them were destroyed. Our war finally consumed the planet, and the All Spark was lost to the stars. Megatron followed it to Earth, where Captain Witwicky found him. My grandfather. It was an accident that intertwined our fates. Come back! I think the dogs have found something. The ice is cracking! Captain! Grab my rope, Captain! I'm all right, lads! Can we throw you a rope, Captain? Megatron crash-landed before he could retrieve the Cube. Men! We've made a discovery! He accidentally activated his navigation system. The coordinates to the Cube's location on Earth were imprinted on his glasses. How'd you know about his glasses? - EBay. - EBay. If the Decepticons find the All Spark, they will use its power to transform Earth's machines and build a new army. And the human race will be extinguished. Sam Witwicky, you hold the key to Earth's survival. Please tell me that you have those glasses. It's like a self-regenerating molecular armor. Look at the scorch mark where the sabot round hit. Melted right through. Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like, a 6,000-degree magnesium burn? Close to it. It melts tank armor. So this metal skin must react to extreme heat. - Heads up! - Oh! I thought you said that thing was dead, man! Strap it down! Strap it! This thing is wicked. All right, get on the horn with Northern Command. Tell them that our effective weapon is high-heat sabot rounds. Recommend we load them on all the gunships. Go. You want that piece? Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break it down to you how it's gonna happen. They gonna come through that door and be good cop, bad cop. Don't fall for that, all right? That's why I ate their food. See, they put the plate of donuts out here to test your guilt. If you don't touch it, you're guilty. I ate the whole plate. The whole plate. Okay? It's me and you. They walk through that door, you don't say nothing. She did it! She did it! She's the one you want! All right? I was just sitting at home watching cartoons, playing video games with my cousin, and she came in there. - And then... - Glen, you freak. Hey! I am not going to jail for you or anybody else! I have done nothing bad my entire life! Hey, man, I'm still a virgin. Okay, so what? I've downloaded a couple of thousand songs off the Internet. Who hasn't? Who hasn't? - I promise! - Glen, shut up! No, you shut up! Don't talk to me! Don't talk to me, criminal! - Oh, sugar rush. - This is... This is not his fault. See? So can I go home now? - Oh, okay. I won't. - But just listen to me. Okay, whoever hacked into your military system downloaded a file, all right? It was something about someone named Witwicky and some government group, right? Named Sector Seven. You have to let me talk to Defense Secretary Keller before you go to war with the wrong country! Whatever fell out of the sky ended up right behind... - What did he say? - What? - Did he hear it, too? - Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah. - What does he think it is? - He thinks it's a military experiment. - What a knucklehead. - Yeah, well, I think it's a plane. Still no official word as to what happened. You can see... - Yeah! - Call Sam. - Yeah. Why? - He should be home in 15 minutes. Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes. If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late and you'll have to ground him. Well, I can't ground him if he's not late, can I? I need you to stay here, all right? You got to stay here and you're gonna watch them. - Okay, okay. - All of them. - Do you hear what I'm saying? - Yeah, okay, okay. Five minutes, all right? - Thanks for staying on my path. - Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey! The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry. I forgot about the path. I'm gonna sweep the whole thing right now. How about that? - You know, I buy half your car... - Yeah. ...then I bail you out of jail and then I just decided to do all your chores. - The chores. - Yeah. Life is great, huh? Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is. It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad. I'm gonna do the trash cans now. No, no, I don't want you to strain yourself. No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad. - I'll do it. - It would hurt my feelings if you do it. - You sure? I don't mind, I don't... - I promise... No, no, no, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do the trash cans and I'm gonna scrape the grill and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up the whole house right now. - Tonight, right now? - Right now. The... I love you. God, I love you just so much right now. You know, Mom wanted me to ground you. - You're three minutes late. - Right? Oh, well, just another thing you did for me, Dad, because you're such a swell guy. One more thing, huh? All right, I love you! Sleep good, handsome man! What are you doing? What are you doing? No, watch the path! Watch the path! Watch the... Please, please, please. No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no! - Sorry. My bad. - Oh, I... You couldn't... You couldn't wait for five... You couldn't wait for five minutes? I told you to just stay! Just stay! God! - I told you to watch them. I told you. - Okay, you know what? - They seem to be in a little bit of a rush. - Oh, this is bad. No! Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God! - Oh, wet. - No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy! Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo. This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine. He's a pet. Okay? That's all. If you could just put the guns away... - Put the... Put them away. Please. - You have a rodent infestation. - A what? - Shall I terminate? No, no, no, no. He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua. This is my... This is my Chihuahua. We love Chihuahuas! Don't we? He's leaked lubricants all over my foot. - He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo! - Bad Mojo! I'm sorry. He's got a male dominance thing. That's all it is. - My foot's gonna rust. - All right. Okay, okay. - Shut up and go hide! - Just hurry. Autobots, recon. I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen. Got some ice on his nose. I had to slap him around a little bit. You did not. - You didn't even ground him. - Almost, almost. Where are they? No, no, no, no, no. Come on, come on. - What? What is this? - Time is short. - They really want those glasses. - Come on. What are you doing? - I'm gonna help you. - Okay. - Please hurry. - Okay. - Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone. - What do you mean? My glasses were in the bag. They were in the backpack and now the backpack isn't here. Well, they're gonna be pissed, so what do you wanna do? So what I think you should do is you should... You should check this whole... This whole section here. Just give it a clean sweep, and I'll get the corner here. Yeah, no, no, no. Not there. That's my... That's my private... - Sorry. That's nothing. - You just... - You just told me to look... - I know, but I didn't mean to look inside of my treasure chest. You should be way more specific so I don't get in trouble in your room. I'm already stressed out enough. Okay. What now? No. No, no. No, no, no. This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding. This is my backyard, not a truck stop. Oh, God. Oh! Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed right here and now it's gone. My moped's under there, man! Who's gonna pay for that? Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam. - He's back here. - I can't deal with this. I can't... What? Oh, no, no, no. - This is my mother's flower... - Oops. Okay, listen. You got to listen to me. If my parents come out here and see you, they're gonna freak out. My mother's got a temper, okay? We must have the glasses. I know you need the glasses. I've been looking everywhere. They're not here. They're definitely not here. Keep searching. I need you to be quiet for five minutes. Ten minutes. Okay? Please, I'm begging you. You got to... You're making a racket. I can't concentrate. You want me to look and I'm hearing... Calm down, calm down. You got to do something here. You got to do something here. - Autobots, fall back. - Thank you. Please, for five minutes. Good? Good? Okay. - Move! - Get away! What's the matter with you? Can't you be quiet? He wants us to be quiet. Earthquake! Move, move, move, move, move! Earthquake! Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it! Duck and cover right now! Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it! Duck and cover right now! How did you get over there so fast? Wow! That was tingly! - You got to try that! - Yeah, that looks fun. - Sam? - Sammy? - What the hell is that? - I don't know. - Sam? - That's weird. - Sam! - Ratchet, point the light. - Come on, hurry. - Listen, we got a major issue in here. What's with the light? You gotta stop the light. What's going on? Turn it off. You gotta tell him to shut it off. - Shut it off. - Sam, are you in there? How come the door's locked? You know the rules. No doors locked in my house! You know he'll start counting - if you don't open the door! - One more chance. Five... Oh, dear. - Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal. - He's counting! - Sam, just open the door. - Three. - Oh, my. - Two. - He's counting. - Stand back. - What's up? What's with the bat? - Who were you talking to? - I'm talking to you. - Why are you so sweaty and filthy? I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager. We heard voices and noises and we thought maybe you were... It doesn't matter what we thought. What was that light? No, what light? What? There's no light, Dad! There's no light! You got two lights in your hand! That's what it is. - Maybe it bounced... - There was light under the door. Look, you can't... You can't just bounce into my room like that. You got to knock. You got to communicate. - We knocked for five minutes. - I'm a teenager. - We knocked. - You didn't knock. - You were screaming at me, okay? - No. This is repression, what you're doing here. - You're ruining my youth, okay? - Oh, for Pete's sakes! You are so defensive! Were you masturbating? - Judy. - Was I... - No, Mom. - Zip it, okay? - It's okay. - No, I don't masturbate! That's not something for you to bring up. - That's a father-and-son thing, okay? - Father-son thing. I mean, you don't have to call it that word if that makes you uncomfortable. You can call it Sam's happy time or... - Happy time? ...my special alone time... - Stop. - Mom. - Judy, stop. ...with myself. - Mom, you can't come in and... - I'm sorry. It's just been a weird night. I've had a little bit to drink. - No, no, Dad. - Yeah, well, we saw a light. Oh, parents. I don't know where it was, but we saw it. Earthquake! It's another one! Another earthquake! Get in the doorway! - Okay! - Aftershock! Aftershock! - Okay! - Aftershock! Aftershock! Oh, I hate these. - Got to ride it out. Ride it out! - Quick, hide. - Hey, the lights are back on. - Hide? What? - Where? - Come on, get out of that tub. Can't you take safety seriously? - Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam. - Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh. Oh, no! Look at the yard. The yard is destroyed. Judy? Better call the city. We got a blown transformer! Power pole's sparking all over the place! Oh, man. Yard's a waste. Trashed. Gone. - It's a wash. The whole yard. - You're kidding. The parents are very irritating. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Can I take them out? Ironhide, you know we don't harm humans. What is with you? Well, I'm just saying we could. It's an option. We heard you talking to somebody, Sam. - We wanna know who. - Mom, I told... Hi. I'm Mikaela. I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's. Gosh, you're gorgeous. Isn't that the prettiest girl? - She can hear you talking, Mom. - Thank you. Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to hear our little family discussion about... - Sorry that we're bugging you. - Do you have my backpack? - Come on, hon. Let's go. - Oh, it's in the kitchen. Oh, yes. Okay. Okay. - Yeah. - Your mom's so nice. I want you to distract my parents while I slip out and get these glasses to them, okay? - Ronald Wickity? - It's Witwicky. Who are you? We're the government. Sector Seven. - Never heard of it. - Never will. Your son's the great-grandson of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not? It's Witwicky. May I enter the premises, sir? Ron, there's guys all over the front yard. What the heck is going on here? Your son filed a stolen car report last night. We think it's involved in a national security matter. - They're ripping up my rose bushes! - National security? That's right. National security. My God, Ron, they're everywhere. There's guys in suits all around the house! Look at this! Could you stay off the grass? Get me a sample and some isotope readings. They're pulling bushes out of the ground! Good Lord! They've got to get their hands off my bush! - Drop the bat, ma'am. - Hey, hey, hey, that's my... I'm carrying a loaded weapon. But you'd better get those guys out of my garden or I am gonna beat the crap out of them! Are you experiencing any flu-like symptoms? Aching joints? Fever? - No! - What is this? How you doing, son? Is your name Sam? - Yeah. - Well, I need you to come with us. Whoa, way out of line. Sir, I am asking politely. Back off. - You're not taking my son. - Really? You gonna try to get rough with us? No, but I'm gonna call the cops because there's something fishy going on around here. Yeah. There's something a little fishy about you, your son, your little Taco Bell dog and this whole operation you got going on here. - What operation? - That is what we are gonna find out. I think direct contact. - Son? - Yeah. - Step forward, please. - Just stand? Fourteen rads. Bingo! Tag them and bag them! If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass! Get me a sample on that vegetation ASAP! Sam! Do not say anything, Sam! - Yeah. - Not a word until we get a lawyer! So, LadiesMan217. That is your eBay username, right? Yeah, but, you know, it was a typo and I ran with it. What do you make of this? My name is Sam Witwicky, okay? And my... Is that you? Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan. Last night at the station, you told the officer your car transformed. - Enlighten me. - Well, here's what I said, okay? 'Cause this is a total misunderstanding that my car had been stolen... - Really? ...from me, from my home, but it's fine now because it's back! It came back! - Well, not by itself. - Well, no. Because cars don't do that because that would be crazy. That's funny. That is so funny. So what do you kids know about aliens, huh? Oh, you mean, like a Martian? Like what, E. T.? No. - It's an urban legend. - Yeah. You see this? This is an I-can-do-whatever-I-want and-get-away-with-it badge. - Right. - I'm gonna lock you up forever. Oh, God. You know what? Don't listen to him. He's just pissy 'cause he's got to get back to guarding the mall. You, in the training bra, do not test me. Especially with your daddy's parole coming up. What? Parole? - It's nothing. - Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing? You know those cars my dad used to teach me to fix? Well, they... They weren't always his. You stole cars? Well, we couldn't always afford a babysitter, so sometimes he had to take me along. She's got her own juvie record to prove it! She's a criminal. Criminals are hot. That'd be a real shame if he had to rot in jail the rest of his natural life. It is time to talk! Big! It's big! Go, go, go, go! - I can't see it! I can't see it! - Shift your weight towards the front! All right! All right! You A-holes are in trouble now. Gentlemen, I want to introduce you to my friend, Optimus Prime. Taking the children was a bad move. Autobots, relieve them of their weapons. Freeze! - Whoa! Whoa! - Give me those! Whoa! Whoa! Hi, there. You don't seem afraid. Are you not surprised to see us? Look, there are S-Seven protocols, okay? I'm not authorized to communicate with you except to tell you I can't communicate with you. - Get out of the car. - All right. - Me? You want me to get... - Now! All right, all right. Get out. Hey. All right, I'm... I'm getting out. I'm getting out. You see? Very nifty how you put us down without really killing us. You're good with handcuffs, too, now, huh? How you doing? - You weren't supposed to hear all that. - How's it going, huh? - Yeah. - This is real. Now, listen. If I choose to engage with him, mum is the word, all right? Sam, I have a record because I wouldn't turn my dad in. When have you had to sacrifice anything in your perfect little life? Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh? What is Sector Seven? Answer me. I'm the one who asks questions around here. Not you, young man! - How'd you know about the aliens? - Where did you take my parents? - I am not at liberty to discuss it. - No? Hey. You touch me, that's a federal offense. Do-whatever-you-want and-get-away-with-it badge, right? Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with his big alien friend standing over there. - Where is Sector Seven? - Wouldn't you like to know? Hey! Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man. Get that thing to stop, huh? - All right, tough guy, take it off. - What are you talking about? - Your clothes, all of it, off. - For what? For threatening my dad. Little lady, this is the beginning of the end of your life. You're a criminal. Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool. Those are nice. Now get behind the pole. All right. This is such a felony, what you're doing. - I will hunt you down, okay? - He'll hunt you down. - Without any remorse! - No remorse. - Enjoy. - Okay? - We have got to alert everyone. - They already know. Speaker. Optimus! Incoming! Roll out. Okay, I'm picking up rad readings under that bridge right down there. Okay, I'm getting really good rad readings. Forty-two and higher. Up you get. Okay, we're dropping in. Really strong readings right down below us. There he is. Ship one and two, come on in. That's it, right there. Mark him, mark him. Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30. Right off the nose. I got it. 12:00. Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him. Got him going down the street. Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him. Got no IR signature. Where'd he go? Okay, I lost him. I lost him. Okay, we're coming around. Easy, you two. No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me! Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping! I'm slipping! - Hold on! - No! Sam! All right, we've got him pinned. We've got him pinned in the river. I'm in for the shot. Stop! Stop! Wait! No! - Take the shot, get him. - Take the shot. No! No! Stop! Stop! Get down on the ground! Get down! Get down! What? Okay. Look, he's not fighting back! Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it! Stop hurting him! Don't let him move! I got him here! No! Happy to see me again? Put him in a car with his little criminal friend. I want that thing frozen and ready for transport! Hang back. Let me check it out. Optimus, are we just gonna stand here and do nothing? There's no way to free Bumblebee without harming the humans. - But it's not right. He... - Let them leave. The Chinese and the Russians are nearing our area of operations in the western Pacific. We feel like this could get out of hand real fast. But the next couple of hours may just define his presidency. US and Chinese task forces approaching 100 nautical miles of cruise missile range. Tell the strike group commander that he's not to engage unless fired on first. - Yes, sir! - Mr. Secretary? Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven, Advanced Research Division. Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom. I think you can see that. - What's going on here? - I don't know. Sit rep! Talk to me! - The whole room's gone down, sir. - I can see that! The virus was coded to shut us down. - General? - I'll take a seat. What do you mean, ""shut us down""? They used our network to spread out to the whole world. The blackout's global. We have no communications, satellite and land lines are dead. You mean to tell me that I cannot pick up this telephone and call my family? Mr. Secretary? I'm here under direct order from the President. You really need to see what I have in the case. You'll have to accept that there are certain things you won't understand right away. Sector Seven is a special-access division of the government convened in secret under President Hoover 80 years ago. You may remember NASA JPL lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover. We told them to report the mission a complete failure. It wasn't. Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds. This was classified above top secret. EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes. More than just a pile of Martian rocks. This is the image from Mars. Here's the image your Special Ops team was able to retrieve from the base attack. We believe they are of the same exoskeletal type, and obviously not Russian or North Korean. Are we talking about an invasion? We intercepted the message from your Special Ops team. These things can be hurt by our weapons and now they know it. That's why the virus shut us down, so we can't coordinate against their next attack, which I would bet my ridiculous government salary is coming soon. Get word to our fleet commanders over the National Guard frequency. It's a shortwave radio channel. It might be still working. Tell them to turn their ships around and come home. ASAP! And inform all commands to prepare for imminent attack. Captain Lennox, we need you and your team to come with us right now! Let's go! She's in here. What's going on? You're coming with me. - You're going to be my advisor. - Me, too? Who's this? - He's my advisor. - He comes, too. - So... - What'd they get you for? I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot. Wow. Who knew? Make a hole! Watch your back! Please, let this work. Fire it up, Optimus. The code. The code on these glasses indicates the All Spark is 230 miles from here. I sense the Decepticons are getting ready to mobilize. They must know it's here, as well. What about Bumblebee? We can't just leave him to die and become some human experiment! He'll die in vain if we don't accomplish our mission. Bumblebee is a brave soldier. This is what he would want. Why are we fighting to save the humans? They're a primitive and violent race. Were we so different? They're a young species. They have much to learn. But I've seen goodness in them. Freedom is the right of all sentient beings. You all know there's only one way to end this war. We must destroy the Cube. If all else fails, I will unite it with the spark in my chest. That's suicide. The Cube is raw power. It could destroy you both. A necessary sacrifice to bring peace to this planet. We cannot let the humans pay for our mistakes. It's been an honor serving with you all. - Autobots, roll out! - We rolling! Team attention! Present arms! At ease. Captain, Sergeant. Got your intel. Excellent work. Thank you, sir. What about the gunships? They're being retrofitted with sabot rounds now. If they hit us again, we'll be ready for them. But it won't do us much good if we can't get world communications back up. Hey, kid. I think we got off to a bad start, huh? You must be hungry? You want a latte? HoHo? Double venti macchiato? Where's my car? Son, I need you to listen to me very carefully. People can die here. We need to know everything you know. We need to know it now. Okay. But first, I'll take my car, my parents. Maybe you should write that down. Oh, and her juvie record. That's got to be gone. Like, forever. Come with me. We'll talk about your car. Thank you. The man's an extortionist. All right, here's the situation. You've all had direct contact with the NBEs. NBEs? Non-Biological Extraterrestrials. Try and keep up with the acronyms. What you're about to see is totally classified. Dear God. What is this? Dear God. What is this? We think when he made his approach over the north pole, our gravitational field screwed up his telemetry. He crashed in the ice, probably a few thousand years ago. We shipped him here to this facility in 1934. We call him NBE One. Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you on everything you think you know, but, I mean, that's Megatron. He's the leader of the Decepticons. He's been in cryostasis since 1935. Your great-great-grandfather made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of mankind. Fact is, you're looking at the source of the modern age, the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars, all reverse-engineered by studying him. NBE One. That's what we call it. And you didn't think the United States military might need to know that you're keeping a hostile alien robot frozen in the basement? Until these events, we had no credible threat to national security. Well, you got one now. - So why Earth? - It's the All Spark. All Spark? What is that? Well, yeah, they came here looking for some sort of cube-looking thing. Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA Megatron, that's what they call him, who's pretty much the harbinger of death, wants to use the Cube to transform human technology to take over the universe. That's their plan. - And you're sure about that? - Yeah. You guys know where it is, don't you? Follow me. You're about to see our crown jewel. Carbon dating puts the Cube here around 10,000 BC. The first Seven didn't find it until 1913. They knew it was alien because of the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube as well as NBE One. President Hoover had the dam built around it. Four football fields thick of concrete. A perfect way to hide its energy from being detected by anyone or any alien species on the outside. Wait, back up. You said the dam hides the Cube's energy. - What kind exactly? - Good question. Please step inside. They have to lock us in. Oh, wow. What's that? Freddy Krueger done been up in here or something? Oh, no, man. Freddy Krueger have four blades, man. That's only three. That's Wolverine! - Right? That's Wolverine! - That's very funny. Anybody have any mechanical devices? BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone? I got a phone. Nokias are real nasty. You've got to respect the Japanese. They know the way of the samurai. Nokia's from Finland. Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange. He's a little strange. We're able to take the Cube radiation and funnel it into that box. - Mean little sucker, huh? - That thing is freaky! Kind of like the itty-bitty Energizer Bunny from hell, huh? He's breaking the box. Go! Go! Go! Move! Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here. Banachek. What's going on? Well, the NBE One hangar has lost power... - What? ...and the backup generator - is just not gonna cut it. - Do you have an arms room? Megatron! Megatron! Megatron! I'll bring security to the... Get everyone to the NBE One chamber now! - The lights are out! - Move it! Move it! Let's go! They're popping our generators! Megatron melting! 16502. We're losing pressure. Stand by! Set! We're losing pressure! The cryogenic system is failing! We're losing NBE One! Forty millimeter sabot rounds on that table! That's good. Get all the ammo you got. Everything you can carry. Bring it. You got to take me to my car. You have to take me to my car. He's gonna know what to do with the Cube. - Your car? It's confiscated. - Then unconfiscate it. We do not know what will happen if we let it near this thing! - You don't know. - Maybe you know, but I don't know. You just wanna sit here and wait and see what happens? I have people's lives at stake here, young man. Take him to his car! Drop it. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Drop your weapon, soldier. There's an alien war going on and you're gonna shoot me? You know, we didn't ask to be here. I'm ordering you under S-Seven executive jurisdiction. S-Seven don't exist. Right. And we don't take orders from people that don't exist. - I'm gonna count to five. Okay. - Well, I'm gonna count to three. - Simmons? - Yes, sir? I'd do what he says. Losing's really not an option for these guys. All right. Okay. Hey, you want to lay the fate of the world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool. No, no! Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! No, no, stop, stop, stop! Let him go! Let him go! Are you okay? They didn't hurt you, right? Listen to me. The Cube is here and the Decepticons are coming. No, no, don't worry about them. They're okay. Right? They're not gonna hurt you. Just back up a little bit. He's friendly. He's fine. Okay, come on. Put the guns down. They're not gonna hurt you. Here, come with me. I'm gonna take you to the All Spark. Okay, here we go. He doing something. He doing something. Oh, my God. Message from Starfleet, Captain. Let's get to it. He's right. We stay here, we're screwed with Megatron in the other hangar. Mission City is 22 miles away. We're gonna sneak that Cube out of here and we're gonna hide it somewhere in the city. Good! Right. But we cannot make a stand without the Air Force. This place must have some kind of radio link! - Yes. Shortwave, CB. - Right, yes. Sir, you got to figure out some way to get word out to them. Let's move! In the alien archive, sir! - The alien... - There's an old Army radio console. - Will it work? - Anything's possible! - Did you see that... - All right, Sam, get it in the car! Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air. When we get to the city, we're gonna find a radio, and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay? Affirmative! Warning! NBE One cryo-containment failing. Check that backup system! The cryo's failing! You got to bump up the cryo! The cryo's failing! Come on! Get out of here! Heads up! Look out! Set a perimeter around the yellow vehicle! - This way, this way, this way! - Up there! Let's go! I am Megatron! - The Cube's okay? - Yeah, it's fine. Well, put the seat belt on. Pour it on him! I live to serve you, Lord Megatron. Where is the Cube? The humans have taken it. You fail me yet again, Starscream. Get them! Come on, Mags! Over here, sir! Give me a minute. Give me a minute. Come to me, Maxwell, come to me. Plugged in there. - We're hot! We're live! - Where are the mikes? Mikes? This doesn't work without mikes, Simmons. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Let's find them. Kid, get in the chair! Just get in the chair, all right? - Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit. - They steal everything out of this place. How do we get the signal out? How do we call the Air Force? - Glen? - Huh? Can you hotwire this computer to transmit a tone through the radio? What good is that? Morse code! You can use this to transmit it through that! Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around. Okay, let's see. Simmons, I need a screwdriver! There's Optimus. Almost done. What the hell was that? Barricade the door! - Get something. - Watch out! Six, five, four, six, three. Here! Put some rounds in! Master search. I got it! We're transmitting! Send exactly what I say! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Burn, you little sucker! Burn! ""This is Defense Secretary Keller. Get me NORTHCOM commander."" - Whoa! - Whoa! What was that? Authenticate emergency action. Blackbird 1195... Sir, I have an authenticated air strike order from Sec Def. - No, no, no, no, no. - What? It's the same cop! Block them, block them, block them. Oh, my God. Cool, Mom! This is so not good. He's behind the pillar! - Shoot that mother... - Maggie, cover fire! It's the Air Force! They're responding! Sucker, burn! Oh, shit! Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city! Raptors, let's scramble, scramble, scramble. Strike and Dark Star roll call. Looking out the right side. Push to Kill Box One Alpha... - Come on, let's go! Mount up! - Move out! Move out! Go! Go! Here, I got shortwave radios. Wait. What am I supposed to do with these? Well, use them! It's all we got! This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios or something, man. I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles out of these things. Are there any aircraft orbiting the city? F-22 at 12:00. All right, I want planes for air cover and get Black Hawks on station to extract that Cube. You got it? Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke! Raptor, Raptor, do you copy? We have you visual. Green smoke is the mark. Provide air cover and vector Black Hawks for extraction. It's Starscream! Please tell me you copy. Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee! No, no, no, no, no! Move! - Back up! Back up! - Retreat! Fall back! Incoming! Anybody hurt? Everyone okay? Clear the area! Oh, my God. Bumblebee? No. Your legs! Your legs. Here. Here, back, back, back, back! You all right? Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up! Ratchet! - What the hell was that? - What are you talking about? What do you mean, what am I talking about? They shot at us! F-22 pilots would never fly below buildings. That's alien. That ain't friendly! You got to get up. You're okay. You're okay. Come on! Army Black Hawk inbound to your location. Over. Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles. November Victor, 1.2 clicks north. Move out! Let's go! Let's go! Move! I'm not gonna leave you. Come on, Decepticon punk! Oh, my God! Concentrate your fire! Come on. Come on. Megatron! It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back! Fall back! Get our guys out of the way! Get out of here! Go! Get them out of the buggy! Move out! We need air cover down here now! Sam, help me with this. - That all you got, Megatron? - Come here, little cretin. You want a piece of me? You want a piece? No! I want two! What's going on? Sir! That tank thing's getting back up. Oh, these things just don't die. Oh, we're so dead. - Wrap it around the head. - Sam! Where's the Cube? - Right there. - Okay. And take that and wrap it around the base and then put it around his neck. - Okay? - Epps, get those Black Hawks here! That building. - Okay. - What? All right, I can't leave my guys back there, so here, take this flare. Okay, there's a tall, white building with statues on top. - Go to the roof. Set the flare. - No. - Signal the chopper and set the flare. - No, no. I can't do this! Listen to me! You're a soldier now! All right? I need you to take this Cube. Get it into military hands while we hold them off, or a lot of people are gonna die. - You got to go. You got to go. - No, I'm not leaving. - You need to go. Go. - No, I'm not leaving till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay? Army Black Hawk requested. Immediate evac for civilian boy with precious cargo. Headed to rooftop marked by flare. - Sam, we will protect you. - Okay. - Epps, where are those planes? - Sam! No matter what happens, I'm really glad I got in that car with you. Sam! Get to the building! Move! - Decepticons, attack! - Hit it! - Cover fire! - Move to cover! Watch out! - Girl, get that tow truck out of here! - I'm going! I'm going! Get out of here now! Megatron! Prime. Humans don't deserve to live. They deserve to choose for themselves. Then you will die with them! Join them in extinction! Keep moving, Sam! Don't stop! No! Sam, get to the building! Give me that Cube, boy! Did that jerk just dent my car? You're not gonna get me. You're not gonna get me! I smell you, boy! Maggot! Oh, no! I'll drive! You shoot! This isn't going well! Shoot! Shoot! Nice shot. - That tank is definitely dead now. - All right, let's go! We got business! Hey! Hey! I'm over here! We've got the boy. Watch out! Missile! Hang on, Sam! No! No! Is it fear or courage that compels you, fleshling? Where do I go? Give me the All Spark and you may live to be my pet. Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm never giving you this All Spark! Oh, so unwise. I got you, boy. Hold on to the Cube! - Oh, no. Oh, no! - Disgusting. Sam? You risked your life to protect the Cube. No sacrifice, - no victory. - If I cannot defeat Megatron, you must push the Cube into my chest. I will sacrifice myself to destroy it. Get behind me. It's you and me, Megatron. No, it's just me, Prime. At the end of this day, one shall stand, one shall fall. You still fight for the weak! That is why you lose! Fighter jets in 60 seconds. We got friendlies mixed with bad guys. Targets will be marked. Hey. Bring the rain. All right? All right, let's kill these things. - Move, move, move! - Remember, aim low. Armor's weak under the chest. Target marked. Still waiting. Time on target, 20 seconds. F-22s, we're still waiting. Move out! Incoming! Weapons armed. Status green. Run! Move! Second wave's on approach. What is that? Break off! - Copy. - It's either a massive amount of... Two, get a lock! Pop that guy! Stay on him. Keep him in your sights. Take him out! Two's down! I'll kill you! Mine! All Spark! Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now! Sam! No, Sam! Hold up. You left me no choice, brother. Sam, I owe you my life. We are in your debt. Prime, we couldn't save him. Jazz. We lost a great comrade but gained new ones. Thank you, all of you. You honor us with your bravery. Permission to speak, sir? Permission granted, old friend. You speak now? I wish to stay with the boy. If that is his choice. Yes. Gentlemen, the President has ordered Sector Seven be terminated and the remains of the dead aliens disposed of. The Laurentian Abyss is seven miles below sea level, deepest place on our planet. The massive depth and pressure there, coupled with subfreezing temperatures, would crush and entomb them, leaving no evidence. With the All Spark gone, we cannot return life to our planet. And fate has yielded its reward, a new world to call home. We live among its people now, hiding in plain sight, but watching over them in secret, waiting, protecting. I have witnessed their capacity for courage. And though we are worlds apart, like us, there's more to them than meets the eye. I am Optimus Prime and I send this message to any surviving Autobots taking refuge among the stars. We are here. We are waiting. Can you shed any light on the recent, so-called alien activity in the area? Do you know what? I think that if there was some sort of an alien - infestation... - Yeah. They, the government, would be the first to let you know. The government would let us know. - I mean, this is America. - Yeah. You know, that's how we know we live in a free land, because there's no secrets. They'd say, ""Hey! Duck and cover."" Your head is kind of a different size than it is on television., The future has not been written. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves. I wish I could believe that. My name is John Connor. They tried to murder me before I was born. When I was 13, they tried again. Machines from the future. Terminators. All my life, my mother told me the storm was coming. - Judgment Day. - Connor! The beginning of a war between man and machines. Three billion lives would vanish in an instant. And I would lead what was left of the human race to ultimate victory. It hasn't happened. No bombs fell. Computers didn't take control. We stopped Judgment Day. I should feel safe... ...but I don't. So I live off the grid. No phone, no address. No one and nothing can find me. I've erased all connections to the past. But as hard as I try... ...I can't erase my dreams... ...my nightmares. I feel the weight of the future bearing down on me. A future I don't want. So I keep running... ...as fast as I can. Anywhere. Nowhere. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Do you want me to call 911? I like this car. What are you--? You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down. Slow down and pull over immediately. Lady, have you any idea how fast you were going? Let me see your license and registration. I like your gun. What? This stupid thing's not working. What's wrong with this thing? I hate machines. - Hello? - Kate, it's your father. You're blowing me off again. I'm so sorry. You know how much I wanted to see you this weekend. - But we're having computer problems-- - I know, you can't talk about it. It's just... ...Scott was really looking forward to this. Katie. I wish I had more time to get to know him. I really do. That's okay. You're bound to run into him at the wedding. Please. I'm still in a state of denial about that. - You're not the only one. - Hey, kiddo. You don't need me to pass judgment on this guy. You've done the right thing your whole life. You won't make a mistake. You never do. I'm the luckiest father in the world, you know? I've never had to be afraid for my daughter. Listen, I hate this. I gotta run. Come see me. I promise I won't cancel. We will. - Bye, Dad, I love you. - Love you too. - Okay, what have we got? - This new computer virus is tricky. It's infected half the civilian Internet as well as secondary military apps. - Payroll, inventory. - Primary defense nets are still clean? So far the firewalls are holding up. Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use our Al to scan the infrastructure. Search and destroy for any hint of the virus. I know, Tony, but that's like going after a fly with a bazooka. Once the connection's made, it should only be a few minutes. During which we've put everything under the control of a single computer system. The most intelligent system ever conceived. I still prefer to keep humans in the loop. I'm not sure Skynet's ready. Yes, sir. Thanks. You're supposed to go around to the back. Hey, I said you're supposed to go-- - Take off your clothes. - Patience, honey. Bitch. Wait your turn. - Your clothes. - Talk to the hand. Now. Welcome to Jim's Burgers. Can I take your order? - Jose Barrera? - Yeah, that's me. Growing concern over widespread outages in the global digital network... ...have prompted rumors of a new computer super-virus. - Wall Street analysts are confident... - Shit! My mom's home. Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer. Here. Take that. Go, go, go. Elizabeth and William Anderson? I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs. Is there something wrong? What's going on? I have to go to the clinic. It's an emergency. It's 4:30 in the morning. Well, I'll be back before you get up. Cool it, guys, it's just me. We've got a sick cat coming in. Great. Junkies. Please, don't do that. I suppose it was you who ripped us off last week. Put the phone down. Sorry. I just... I needed some medicine. There's an emergency clinic half a mile away. Can't do that. How much did you take? - Enough. - Well... ...this is the stuff we use to chemically neuter dogs. Take a look. Hey! Jesus! You didn't have to do that! Next time bring a clue, not a paintball gun. - No, this isn't what you think. - Yeah, right. It's Hercules. I think he's got pneumonia. He started coughing and wouldn't stop. - Betsy, I've got a problem in the back. - A problem? This is an emergency! - It sounds like a hairball. - I know what a hairball sounds like. - Where's Dr.Monroe? - It's 5:30 in the morning. I'm sure he's home sleeping. He'll come in if he has to. Just wait in here with Hercules and I'll be a few minutes, all right? Mike Kripke's basement. What? What does that mean? You're John Connor. I'm Kate Brewster. We went to West Hills Junior High together. - Jesus. - What happened to you, John? Middle of eighth grade, you just disappeared. And there was that thing about your foster parents. Yeah, they were murdered. I didn't do it. What the hell? Is somebody with you? Katherine Brewster? No. John Connor was here. Where did he go? Tell me. Where did he go? Katherine Brewster? What are you doing? Let me down! Let me down! Let me down! Where is John Connor? If I tell you, will you let me go? Yes. He's... ...in the kennel, in a cage. You said that you'd let me go. I lied. Please, please, please. You have to let me go! John Connor. It is time. You here to kill me? No. You must live. - Why are you here? Where are we going? - Keep moving. Get out of here. Now! - No pulse. - See if you can get him down. I can't. This guy weighs a ton. - Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped. - Where are you now? - I don't know where. I'm in my truck. It's a Toyota Tundra. It says ""Emery Animal Hospital"" on the side. I'm locked inside the back. Hello? Hello? Shit! Shit! Get off. Let me out! What are you doing here? You tell me. You got me into this. - Stop the car. - I can't. Not yet. - You bastard! Stop the car! - Shut up! Son of a bitch. Goddamn it. Look what you did to my car. This is my company car, asshole. Get your ass out here. Get your ass out of the car. Now! What are you doing? If you don't have insurance, I'm gonna rip your balls off. - I don't want any problems, okay? - Shut up! Help! Who's talking back there? What's going on? - Calm down. - Shut up! - I'm being kidnapped! Call the police! - Well, I'll be goddamned. - Call 911! - A cop when you need one. Help, please! Please! Let me out of here! Help! Get back here, asshole! That's the cops! You have to pull over! Yeah, first chance I get. Hold on! Stop it! I'll drive. Get out. Excuse me. Move over. No sign of brain trauma. Yeah, I'm fine, thanks. Do you even remember me? Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne? ""Hasta la vista, baby."" Ring any bells? That was a different T-101. What, do you come off an assembly line or something? Exactly. Oh, man. I'm gonna have to teach you everything all over again. Katherine Brewster, have you sustained injury? Drop dead, you asshole! I'm unable to comply. Where are you taking me? To a safe location. All right, get off at the next exit. Let her out. Negative. Katherine Brewster must be protected. - I thought I was the one they were after. - You could not be located. So a T-X was sent back through time to eliminate your lieutenants. So she's gonna be in the Resistance? No, no. No, you shouldn't even exist. I mean, we took out Cyberdyne over 10 years ago. - We stopped Judgment Day. - You only postponed it. Judgment Day is inevitable. I require a cutting tool. Here, take the wheel. - What are you doing? - I am powered by two hydrogen fuel cells. My primary cell was damaged by a plasma attack. T-X is designed for extreme combat, driven by a plasma reactor... ...and equipped with onboard weapons. Its arsenal includes... ...nanotechnological transjectors. - Meaning? - It can control other machines. Its body chassis is heavily armored and hardened to withstand external attack. - You'll find a way to destroy her. - Unlikely. I'm an obsolete design. T-X is faster, more powerful and more intelligent. It's a far more effective killing machine. Oh, great. That's great. My presence in this timeline has been anticipated. T-X is designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms. So she's an anti-Terminator Terminator? You've gotta be shitting me. No, I am not shitting you. When ruptured, the fuel cells become unstable. Relax. - Let me out of here! - Relax! Man, this is wack. It's been like this for hours. Every goddamn station. Hey. Hey! Are you gonna pay for that? Talk to the hand. Help! Help me! Help! I think we better go. Jerky? You're kidnapping me. - Look-- - God, you were always a delinquent. And look at you now, sitting there like the bad boy thing still works. What are you, some kind of gang member? How do you live with yourself? What? Tell her who I am. John Connor is leader of the Worldwide Resistance and last hope of humankind. Right. And him? He's a robot from the future. Living tissue over a metal skeleton, sent back in time to protect me. Go to hell. He doesn't mean you any harm. I have a fiance. He's gonna be looking for me. What is it that you want? Just... ...imagine... ...if you knew you were gonna do something important with your life. Something amazing. Maybe the most important thing anyone has ever done. But there's a catch. Something terrible has to happen. You couldn't... ...live with yourself if you didn't try to stop it, but... What are you talking about? It's just-- The life you know... ...all the stuff that you take for granted... ...it's not gonna last. Mike Kripke. Back there, why did you say ""Kripke's basement""? Because Mike Kripke's house... ...that's where the kids used to go make out, right? So you and me-- Wait, did we...? Holy shit, we did. We made out in Kripke's basement. I cannot believe you remembered that. I must have made some kind of impression. Give me a break. I only remembered because the next day you were in the news. Wait a second. You and me hooked up the day before I first met him. And now again, 10 years later. We were supposed to meet. Coincidence. Yeah. Hon? Did you just get in? Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D. This is Detective Bell. We're looking for Katherine Brewster. Is she here? No. - You're her fiance, Scott Mason? - Yes. There was an incident at the veterinary hospital where she works. We're concerned something may have happened to her. Where is she? We got a report from a gas station attendant near Victorville... ...about a possible kidnapping and it might be related. I'll help you find her. Come with me. Go. Your mother? I never even knew where she was buried. I hit the road the day she died. Why did you bring me here? No! What are you doing? Hey, stop! Get away from it! Stop! Sarah Connor was cremated in Mexico. Her friends scattered her ashes in the sea. They stored these weapons in accordance with her will. What happened to her? Leukemia. I'm sorry. We were living in Baja when she was diagnosed. They only gave her six months. But she fought for three years. Long enough to make sure. To make sure? That the world didn't end. ""Every day after this one is a gift."" She told me, ""We made it. We're free."" But I never really believed that. I guess she didn't either. You know you were about the closest thing to a father I ever had? How pathetic is that? Out of my way! My mission is to protect you. That's enough. Move or I'll do it! I swear I will! I'll shoot you! Go ahead. See what happens. Don't do that. Oh, my God. This is the police. We have the building surrounded. Release your hostage! Just leave me here. I'm not the one you want. You're wasting your time. Incorrect. John Connor leads the Resistance to victory. How? Why? Why me? You are John Connor. Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit since the cradle. Look at me. I'm no leader, I never was! I'm never gonna-- Let go. You're right. You're not the one I want. I'm wasting my time. Fuck you, you fucking machine! Better. Oh, you were just dicking with me? Anger is more useful than despair. What? Basic psychology is among my subroutines. Perps still holed up? Gotcha. Good news. Your fiancee's okay. Where is she? Greenlawn Cemetery, up off the 5 freeway. It's right by the desert. But they're gonna bring her back to the-- Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God! You're safe now. They can't hurt you. Kate, my name is Dr.Silberman. I'm a post-trauma counselor for the sheriff's department. How are you feeling? He's not human. He's really not human. I know what it's like to be in a hostage situation. I've been there myself. The fear, the adrenaline. You find yourself imagining things. Impossible things. Crazy things. Insane things. Take years to get over it. - Go, go, go! - Move it! Drop your weapon! And the coffin! Take him down! Take him down! Resume fire! We must reacquire Katherine Brewster. Why? What makes her so goddamn important? Through her, you contact remnants of the military and learn how to fight Skynet... ...forming the core of the Resistance. Later, your children will become important. - What? - She's your wife. Get in! Do you want to live? Come on! - It was Scott! How could it be Scott? - Your fiance? The T-X is polymimetic, able to take the form of anything it touches. Your fiance is dead. Oh, my God! Do something! Get down. We need a new vehicle. Hey, come on. We gotta keep moving. She killed Scott because of me. Look, I know this won't help... ...but sometimes things happen that we just can't change. It's not your fault. Are you sure about this? About her and me, I mean. Your confusion is not rational. She's a healthy female of breeding age. There's more to it than that. My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bonding. So this Terminatrix, how many others does she have on her hit list? Twenty-two. Anderson, Elizabeth. Anderson, William. Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert. My father? Having failed to acquire its primary target, T-X will resume its default program. - She's gonna kill my father too? - There's a high probability. - No. - Who is he? What does he do? He's in the Air Force. Weapon design, secret stuff. I don't know, exactly. General Robert Brewster is program director of CRS... ...Cyber Research Systems, autonomous weapons division. Skynet. You're talking about Skynet. Skynet is one of the digital defense systems developed under Brewster. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Of course. It all makes sense now. If you hadn't come back when I was a kid, changed everything... ...she and I would have gotten together then. I would have met her father. - Don't you see? - I don't understand. Your father. This is all about your father. He's the key. He always was. Your father is the one who can shut Skynet down. He's the only one who ever could. We have to get to him before the T-X does. - Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission. - This is your mission, to save people! My mission is to ensure the survival of John Connor and Katherine Brewster. I am giving you an order. I am not programmed to follow your orders. - After the nuclear war, you both-- - Nuclear war?! There doesn't have to be a war! We can stop it! There is insufficient time. The first launch sequences will be initiated at 6:18 p.m. - What, today? - Affirmative. John, what is he saying? Judgment Day. The end of the world. It's today, three hours from now. Two hours and 53 minutes. We must continue south into Mexico to escape the primary blast zones. No, we have to get to her dad. The Mojave area will sustain significant nuclear fallout. You will not survive. You mean we go run and hide somewhere in a hole while the bombs fall? It is your destiny. - Fuck my destiny. - John. You cannot self-terminate. No, you can't. I can do whatever I want. I'm a human being. I'm not some goddamn robot. - Cybernetic organism. - Whatever! Either we get her father to shut Skynet down... ...stop this shit from ever happening, or so much for the great John Connor. Because your future, my destiny, I don't want any part of it. I never did. Based on your pupil dilation, skin temperature and motor functions... ...I calculate an 83% probability that you will not pull the trigger. Please do what he says. You have to save my father! We can reach CRS in approximately one hour... ...depending on traffic conditions. I can't get a line. The whole cell network is down. Skynet is assuming control over global communications... ...in preparation for its attack. So if this war is between people and machines... ...why are you on our side? The Resistance captured me and reprogrammed my CPU. I was originally designed for assassination missions. So... ...you don't really care if this mission succeeds or not. If we get killed, does that mean anything to you? If you were to die, I will become useless. There will be no reason for me to exist. Thank you for doing this. Your gratitude is not required. I am programmed to follow your commands. Her commands? Katherine Brewster had me reactivated and sent through the time displacement field. What exactly am I in this future of yours? You're John Connor's spouse and second-in-command. No, I-- What? You're a mess. Hey, you're not exactly my type, either. Why didn't I send you back? I am not authorized to answer your question. - Why didn't he send you back? - He was dead. Well, that sucks. - Humans inevitably die. - Yeah, I know. So how does it--? No. Maybe I don't want to know. How does he die? John Connor was terminated on July 4th, 2032. I was selected for the emotional attachment he had for my model number... ...due to his boyhood experiences. This aided in my infiltration. What are you saying? I killed you. This has to be a mistake. As of 1100 hours, all primary military systems were secure. They were. Only the civilian sector was affected. Internet, air traffic. Minutes ago, guidance computers at Vandenberg crashed. We thought it was an error. It looks like the virus. - Early warning in Alaska is down. - Satellite signals are scrambled. What about the missile silos, the subs? We've lost contact. You're saying this country is completely open to attack. Theoretically, we could be under attack already. Who's doing this? A foreign power or some computer hacker in his garage? We can't trace the virus or pin it down. It keeps growing and changing, like it has a mind of its own. This can't be happening. The Pentagon's on the secure line. It's the chairman. All right. Look... ...none of this is gonna happen. We get to your dad, get him to pull the plug on Skynet. The bombs won't fall. He won't have to kill me someday. He'll never even exist. You and I, we can just go our separate ways. You know, Mike Kripke's basement... That was the first time I ever kissed a guy. Really? Your levity is good. It relieves tension and the fear of death. We're hoping you have a solution for us. I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready for a system-wide connection. That's not what your civilian counterparts there told me. They say we can stop this damn virus. I understand there's a certain amount of performance anxiety... ...but your boys say if we plug Skynet into all of our systems... ...it'll squash this thing and give me back control of my military. Mr.Chairman, I need to make myself very clear. If we uplink now, Skynet will be in control of your military. But you'll be in control of Skynet, right? That is correct, sir. Then do it. And Brewster, if this thing works... ...you'll get all the funding you'll ever need. Yes, sir. Sir? Shall I? No. It's my job now. - Skynet Defense System activated. - We're in. We're past the firewalls, local defense nets, Minutemen, subs. Skynet's fully operational, processing at 60 teraflops a second. It should take less than a minute to find the virus and kill it. Let's pray to God this works. Power failure? No. I don't know what it is. What the hell is going on? Daddy! What are you doing here? Daddy! Get away from it! Watch out! Daddy, don't move. She'll be back. We have to shut down Skynet. Where's the system core? In this building? Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet. Skynet is the virus! It's why everything's falling apart! Skynet has become self-aware. In one hour it will initiate a massive nuclear attack on its enemy. What enemy? Us! Humans. Oh, God! It's the machines. They're starting to take over. My office, on this floor, we have to get there. The access codes are in my safe. - Why are they killing everyone? - To destroy any possible threat to Skynet. Which ones are the codes? Red envelope. Crystal Peak. You have to get to Crystal Peak. - What is he saying? - Crystal Peak. A hardened facility in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Fifty-two miles northeast, bearing 0.5 degrees. That's the system core? It's your only chance. You'll need a plane. The particle accelerator leads to the runway. Take care of my daughter. Oh, Katie, I am sorry. I opened Pandora's box. Get down! There's nothing you can do. Come on. We must go. It is not safe here. Kate, we have to go. Kate! He wanted you to come with me. He wanted us to shut Skynet down. Come on. Come on. Run! Let's go. That's it. We can follow it out to the runway. Come on. What? Nothing. You remind me of my mother. Oh, God. She's coming. What are you doing? Powering up. Come on. It's working. Just die, you bitch! Come on. There's my father's plane. I trained on it. Yes! He made it. Get away from me. Leave! Now! Let's go! - The master's on. Throttle's set. - Come on. Let's go. Oh, please. You can't do this. I have no choice. The T-X... ...has corrupted my system. You can't kill a human being. You said so yourself. Let him go! You're fighting it right now. My CPU is intact. But I cannot control my other functions. You don't have to do this. You don't want to do this! Desire is irrelevant. I am a machine. What is your mission? To ensure the survival of John Connor... ...and Katherine Brewster. You are about to fail that mission! I can-- I cannot. You know what you have to do. You know my destiny. I have to live. - Are you okay? - What happened? He couldn't do it. He shut himself down. - Can you fly? - Yeah. Okay. 015 degrees... ...52 miles, our max air speed is about 160. We've got 32 minutes. It's just you and me now. What if we can't stop it? There's enough C-4 here to take out 10 supercomputers. We're gonna make it, Kate. The future is up to us. That's gotta be it. Skynet. There may be more of them. Come on. I think this is some kind of blast door. There's no way we can blow through this thing. John, look. Now what? It's a code prompt. Type in ""Dakota 775."" ""Red 176."" Come on! We gotta get this thing open. Here. It's ""Avalon 412."" Put it in! Come on! I'm back. Go! Now! Come on! - Thank you. - We'll meet again. Go! Come on! You are terminated. The elevator. I'll set the detonator for five minutes. That should give us enough time to get back up. What is this place? These computers are 30 years old. This isn't Skynet. There's nothing here. This is a fallout shelter for VIPs. Only they never got the warning. Goddamn it! There's nothing here! Why didn't he tell us? Why did he lead us down here? To live. That was his mission. There was never any stopping it. John... ...we could just... ...let it go. Hello? Hello? Can somebody hear me? This is Montana Civil Defense. Somebody please come in. Is there anybody there? Anyone reading me? Over. Rumors about a launch sequence. Command and control have broken down. Is anyone receiving me? Somebody? Somebody please come in. Anybody out there? - This is SAC Nellis. We're under attack. - CQ? CQ? Is anybody there? This is John Connor at Crystal Peak. Connor? What the hell is happening? Who's in charge there? I am. Connor, can you help us? This is Montana Civil Defense. Where did you say you were again? By the time Skynet became self-aware... ...it had spread into millions of computer servers across the planet. Ordinary computers in office buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere. It was software and cyberspace. There was no system core. It could not be shut down. The attack began at 6:18 p.m., just as he said it would. Judgment Day. The day the human race was nearly destroyed... ...by weapons they'd built to protect themselves. I should have realized our destiny was never to stop Judgment Day. It was merely to survive it... ...together. The Terminator knew. He tried to tell us... ...but I didn't want to hear it. Maybe the future has been written. I don't know. All I know is what the Terminator taught me: Never stop fighting. And I never will. The battle has just begun., I amar prestar aen. The world is changed. Han mathon ne nen. I feel it in the water. Han mathon ne chae. I feel it in the earth. A han noston ned 'wilith. I smell it in the air. Much that once was... ...is lost. For none now live who remember it. The Lord of the Rings. It began with the forging of the great rings. Three were given to the elves: Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the dwarf-lords: Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine... ...nine rings were gifted to the race of men... ...who, above all else, desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived. For another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom... ... the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring... ... to control all others. And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice... ...and his will to dominate all life. One ring to rule them all. One by one... ... the free lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth. Tangado haid! (Hold positions!) Leithio i philinn! (Fire the arrows!) Victory was near. But the power of the ring... ...could not be undone. It was in this moment... ... when all hope had faded... ... that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword. Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples of Middle-earth, was defeated. The ring passed to Isildur... ... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. But the hearts of men... ...are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur... ... to his death. And some things that should not have been forgotten... ...were lost. History became legend... ...legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years... ... the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came... ...it ensnared a new bearer. My precious. The ring came to the creature Gollum... ... who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. It came to me. My own. My love. My own. My precious. The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For 500 years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East... ... whispers of a nameless fear. And the ring of power perceived... ...its time had now come. It abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. What's this? A hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. A ring. Lost! The 22nd day of September... My precious is lost! For the time will soon come... ... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all. ...in the year 1400... ...by Shire-reckoning. Bag End, Bagshot Row. Hobbiton, Westfarthing... ...the Shire... ...Middle-earth. The third age of this world. The Fellowship of the Ring. There and back again. A Hobbit's tale. By Bilbo Baggins. Now... ...where to begin? Ah, yes.... ""Concerning... ...Hobbits."" Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire... ...for many hundreds of years... ...quite content to ignore and be ignored... ...by the world of the big folk. Middle-earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count... ...Hobbits must seem of little importance... ...being neither renowned as great warriors... ...nor counted among the very wise. Frodo! Someone at the door. In fact, it has been remarked by some... ... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food. A rather unfair observation... ...as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales... ...and the smoking of pipe-weed. But where our hearts truly lie... ...is in peace and quiet... ...and good, tilled earth. For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow. And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint. But today of all days. It is brought home to me... It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life. Frodo, the door! Sticklebacks. Where is that boy? Frodo! Down from the door where it began And I must follow if I can The road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began Now far ahead the road has gone And I must follow if I can - You're late. A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to. It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf! You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday? How is the old rascal? I hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence. You know Bilbo. He's got the whole piece in an uproar. Well, that should please him. Half the Shire's been invited. And the rest of them are turning up anyway. And so life in the Shire goes on... ... very much as it has this past age. Full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly. If it comes at all. For things are made to endure in the Shire... ...passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill... ...in Bag End. And there always will be. To tell you the truth, Bilbo's been a bit odd lateIy. I mean, more than usual. He's taken to locking himself in his study. He spends hours and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking. Where's it gone? He's up to something. - All right, then. Keep your secrets. - What? But I know you have something to do with it. Good gracious me. Before you came along, we Bagginses were very well thought of. Indeed. Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected. If you're referring to the incident with the dragon. I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door. Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace. Oh, really? Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks, Gandalf! - Gandalf! - Fireworks, Gandalf! Gandalf? - I'm glad you're back. - So am I, dear boy. So am I. No, thank you! We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations! And what about very old friends? Gandalf? - Bilbo Baggins. - My dear Gandalf! Good to see you. 111 years old! Who would believe it? You haven't aged a day. Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome. Oh, here we are. Tea...or maybe something a littIe stronger? I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left - 1296. Very good year. Almost as old as I am. It was laid down by my father. What say we open one, eh? Just tea, thank you. I was expecting you sometime last week. Not that it matters. You come and go as you please. Always have and always will. You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid. We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle.... There's some cheese here. No, that won't do. We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart.... But not much for afters. Oh, no, we're all right. I've just found some sponge cake. I could make you some eggs if you'd li... - Just tea, thank you. - Oh, right. - You don't mind if I eat, do you? - No, not at all. Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins! I'm not at home! It's the Sackville-Bagginses. - I know you're in there! - They're after the house. They've never forgiven me for living this long. I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day... ...never giving me a moment's peace. I want to see mountains again. Mountains, Gandalf! And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea. - So you mean to go through with your plan? - Yes, yes. It's all in hand. All the arrangements are made. Oh, thank you. Frodo suspects something. Of course he does. He's a Baggins... ...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle. You will tell him, won't you? - Yes, yes. - He's very fond of you. I know. He'd probably come with me if I asked him. I think in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire. The woods, the fields. Little rivers. I am old, Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. I feel thin. Sort of stretched... ...like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday. A very Long holiday. And I don't expect I shall return. In fact, I mean not to. Old Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing. Gandalf, my old friend... ...this will be a night to remember. Hello, hello. Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you. Welcome, welcome. Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance. - I think I'll just have another ale. - Oh, no, you don't. Go on! So there I was... ...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls. And they were all arguing amongst themselves... ...about how they were going to cook us. Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly. They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors... ...that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees... ...and turned them all to stone! Quickly. Up they go! No no, the big one - big one Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you. Welcome, welcome. Are all these children yours? Good gracious, you have been productive. Bilbo? Sackville-Bagginses! Quickly, hide! Thank you, my boy. You're a good lad, Frodo. I'm very selfish, you know. Yes, I am. Very selfish. I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died... ...but it wasn't out of charity. I think it was because... ...of all my numerous relations... ...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit. Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew? No. Well, yes, but that's not the point. The point is, Frodo... ...you'll be all right. - Done! - You're supposed to stick it in the ground. - It is in the ground. - Outside! This was your idea. Bilbo. Bilbo, watch out for the dragon! Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for thousands of years. - That was good. - Let's get another one. Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. I might've known. Speech, Bilbo! Speech! Speech! My dear Bagginses and Boffins... ...Tooks and Brandybucks... ...Grubbs, Chubbs... ...Hornblowers... ...Bolgers... ...Bracegirdles... ...and Proudfoots. - Proudfeet! Today is my 111th birthday! Happy birthday! But alas, eleventh-one years is far too short a time to live among... ...such excellent and admirable Hobbits. I don't know half of you half as well as I should like... ...and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. I have things to do. I've put this off for far too long. I regret to announce this is the end! I'm going now. I bid you all a very fond farewell. Goodbye. I suppose you think that was terribly clever. Come on, Gandalf. Did you see their faces? There are many magic rings in this world, Bilbo Baggins... ...and none of them should be used lightly. It was just a bit of fun. Oh, you're probably right, as usual. - You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you? - Two eyes. As often as I can spare them. - I'm leaving everything to him. - What about this ring of yours? - Is that staying too? - Yes, yes. It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece. No. Wait, it's... ...here in my pocket. Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now? Yet, after all, why not? - Why shouldn t I keep it? - I think you should leave the ring behind. Is that so hard? Well, no. And yes. Now it comes to it, I don't feel l ike parting with it. It's mine. I found it! It came to me! - There's no need to get angry. - Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's mine. My own. - My precious. - Precious? It's been called that before, but not by you. What business is it of yours what I do with my own things? I think you've had that ring quite long enough. - You want it for yourself! - Bilbo Baggins! Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks. I am not trying to rob you. I'm trying to help you. All your long years, we've been friends. Trust me as you once did. Let it go. You're right, Gandalf. The ring must go to Frodo. It's late. The road is long. Yes, it is time. Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket. I've thought up an ending for my book: ""And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days."" And I'm sure you will, my dear friend. Goodbye, Gandalf. Goodbye, dear Bilbo. The road goes ever on and on... Until our next meeting. It's mine. My own. My precious. Riddles in the dark. Bilbo! Bilbo! My precious. Precious. He's gone, hasn't he? He talked for so long about leaving... ...I didn't think he'd really do it. Gandalf? Bilbo's ring. He's gone to stay with the elves. He's left you Bag End. Along with all his possessions. The ring is yours now. - Put it somewhere out of sight. - Where are you going? - There are some things that I must see to. - What things? - Questions. Questions that need answering. - You've only just arrived. I don't understand. Neither do I. Keep it secret. Keep it safe. Shire! Baggins! ""The year 3434 of the second age. Here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor... ...and the finding of the ring of power."" ""It has come to me. The one ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom. All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate... ...for I will risk no hurt to the ring. It is precious to me... ...though I buy it with great pain. The markings upon the band begin to fade. The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared. A secret now that only fire can tell."" Shire... ...Baggins. There's no Bagginses around here. They're all up in Hobbiton. That way. ""Hey ho to the dock I go To heal my heart and drown my woe Rain may fall and wind may blow But there still be... ...many miles to go Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain And the stream that falls from hill to plain Better than rain or rippling brook Is a mug of beer inside this Took!"" There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire. Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature. War is brewing. The mountains are fair teeming with goblins. Far-off tales and children s stories, that's all that is. You're beginning to sound like that old Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was. Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking. And proud of it. - Cheers, Gaffer. - Aye. Cheers. Weel it's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. Keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble'll come to you. - Good night, lads. - Good night. Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale. Mind who you're sweet-taking. Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one. Does she? - Good night, Sam. - Good night, Mr. Frodo. Is it secret? Is it safe? What are you doing? Hold out your hand, Frodo. It's quite cool. What can you see? Can you see anything? Nothing. There's nothing. Wait. There are markings. It's some form of Elvish. I can't read it. There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here. Mordor! In the common tongue, it says: ""One ring to rule them all... ...One ring to find them... ...One ring to bring them all... ...and in the darkness bind them."" This is the One ring... ...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. Taken by IsiIdur from the hand of Sauron himself. Bilbo found it. - In Gollum's cave. - Yes. For 60 years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping... ...prolonging his life, delaying old age. But no longer, Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has awoken. It's heard its master's call. But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed. No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life force is bound to the ring, and the ring survived. Sauron has returned. His orcs have multiplied. His fortress at Barad-dr is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness. He is seeking it. Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it. For the ring yearns above all else... ...to return to the hand of its master. They are one... ...the ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo... ...he must never find it. All right. We put it away. We keep it hidden. We never speak of it again. No one knows it's here, do they? Do they, Gandalf? There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum. But the enemy found him first. I don't know how long they tortured him. But amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words: Shire! Baggins! Shire. Baggins. But that would lead them here! Who goes there? Take it, Gandalf! - Take it! - No, Frodo. - You must take it! - You cannot offer me this ring! - I'm giving it to you! - Don't tempt me, Frodo! I dare not take it. Not even to keep it safe. Understand, Frodo... ...I would use this ring from a desire to do good. But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine. - But it cannot stay in the Shire! - No. No, it can't. What must I do? - You must leave. And leave quickly. - Where? Where do I go? Get out of the Shire. Make for the village of Bree. Bree. - What about you? - I'll be waiting for you... ...at the inn of the Prancing Pony. - And the ring will be safe there? - I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any answers. I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo. He'll know what to do. You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you. That name is not safe outside the Shire. Travel only by day. And stay off the road. I can cut across country easily enough. My dear Frodo. Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month. And yet, after a hundred years... ...they can still surprise you. Get down. Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping? I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there...If you follow me. A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think? - I heard raised voices. - What did you hear? Speak! Nothing important. That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, and a Dark Lord... ...and something about the end of the world but... Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything unnatural. No? Perhaps not. I've thought of a better use for you. Come along, Samwise. Keep up. Be careful, both of you. The enemy has many spies in his service: Birds, beasts. Is it safe? Never put it on... ...for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power. Always remember, Frodo... ...the ring is trying to get back to its master. It wants to be found. This is it. This is what? If I take one more step... ...it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been. Come on, Sam. Remember what Bilbo used to say: - ""It's a dangerous business, Frodo."" - ""Going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet... ... there's no knowing where you might be swept off to."" Sam. Wood-elves. They're going to the harbor beyond the White Towers. To the Grey Havens. They're leaving Middle-earth. Never to return. I don't know why... ...it makes me sad. Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back. Just shut your eyes... ...and imagine you're back in your own bed... ...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow. It's not working, Mr. Frodo. I'm never going to be able to sleep out here. Me neither, Sam. Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom. The hour grows late. And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard... ...seeking my counsel. For that is why you have come, is it not? My old friend. Saruman. - You are sure of this? - Beyond any doubt. So the ring of power has been found. All these long years, it was in the Shire. - Under my very nose. - Yet you did not have the wit to see it. Your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind. But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly. Time? What time do you think we have? Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form... ...but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf. A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. The eye of Sauron. He is gathering all evil to him. Very soon, he'll have summoned an army... ...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth. You know this? How? I have seen it. A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman. Why? Why should we fear to use it? They are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones. We do not know who else may be watching. The hour is later than you think. Sauron's forces are already moving. The Nine have left Minas Morgul. The Nine? They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve... ...disguised as riders in black. - They've reached the Shire? - They will find the ring. And kill the one who carries it. Frodo! You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor... ...there can be no victory. We must join with him, Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It would be wise, my friend. Tell me... ...friend... ...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness? I gave you the chance of... ...aiding me willingly... ...but you have elected the way of pain! Mr. Frodo? Frodo? Frodo! - I thought I'd lost you. - What are you taking about? - It's just something Gandalf said. - What did he say? ""Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."" And I don't mean to. Sam, we're still in the Shire. What could possibly happen? Frodo. - Merry, it's Frodo Baggins. - Hello, Frodo. Get off him. Come on, Frodo. What's the meaning of this? You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop! You get back here! Get out of my field! You'll know the devil if I catch up with you! I don't know why he's so upset. It's only a couple of carrots. And some cabbages. And those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week. - And then the mushrooms the week before. - Yes, Pippin. My point is... ...he's clearly overreacting. Run! Oh, that was close. I think I've broken something. Trust a Brandybuck and a Took! What? That was just a detour. A short cut. - Short cut to what? - Mushrooms! That's mine. That's nice, Merry. Here's a nice one, Sam. I think we should get off the road. Get off the road! Quick! Be quiet! What was that? Anything? Nothing. What is going on? That Black Rider was looking for something. Or someone. Frodo? Get down! I have to leave the Shire. Sam and I must get to Bree. Right. Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me. Run! This way! Follow me! Run! Get the rope, Sam! Frodo! Run, Frodo! Go! - Hurry! Frodo, come on! - Come on! Faster! - Jump! - How far to the nearest crossing? - The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles. Come on. - What do you want? - We're heading for the Prancing Pony. Hobbits. Four hobbits! What's more, out of the Shire by your talk. What business brings you to Bree? We wish to stay at the inn. Our business is our own. All right young sir, I meant no offense. It's my job to ask questions after nightfall. There's talk of strange folk abroad. Can't be too careful. Out of the way! Watch where you're walking. Excuse me. Good evening, little masters. What can I do for you? If you're looking for accommodation, we got some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available. Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister...? Underhill. My name's Underhill. - Underhill, yeah. - We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. - Can you tell him we've arrived? - Gandalf? Gandalf. Oh, yes... ...I remember. Elderly chap. Big grey beard, pointy hat. Not seen him for six months. What do we do now? Sam... ...he'll be here. He'll come. Get out of my way! What's that? This, my friend, is a pint. It comes in pints? - I'm getting one. - You got a whole half already! That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived. Excuse me. That man in the corner. Who is he? He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. What his right name is, I've never heard, but 'round here he's known as Strider. Strider. Baggins... Baggins... Baggins... Baggins... Baggins... Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins. He's over there. Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin, once removed on his mother's side... ...and my third cousin, twice removed.... - Pippin! - Steady on, Frodo. You cannot hide. I see you. There is no life... ...in the void. Only... ...death. You draw far too much attention to yourself, ""Mr. Underhill."" What do you want? A little more caution from you. That is no trinket you carry. - I carry nothing. - Indeed. I can avoid being seen if I wish... ...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift. - Who are you? - Are you frightened? Yes. Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you. Let him go! Or I'll have you, Longshanks. You have a stout heart, little hobbit. But that will not save you. You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo. They're coming. What are they? They were once men. Great kings of men. Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed, they took them without question. One by one, falling into darkness. Now they are slaves to his will. They are the Nazgl. Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead. At all times they feel... ... the presence of the ring... ...drawn to the power of the One. They will never stop hunting you. - Where are you taking us? - Into the wild. How can we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf? I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer... ...and feel fouler. - He's foul enough. We have no choice but to trust him. - But where is he leading us? - To Rivendell, Master Gamgee. - To the house of Elrond. - Did you hear that? Rivendell. We're going to see the elves. - Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall. - What about breakfast? - You've already had it. - We've had one, yes. What about second breakfast? Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip. What about elevenses? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper? - He knows about them, doesn't he? - I wouldn't count on it. Pippin! What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit? ""Tinviel elvanui (Tinviel the elven-fair) Elleth alfirin ethelhael (Immortal maiden elven-wise) O hon ring finnil fuinui (About him cast her night-dark hair) A renc gelebrin thiliol."" (And arms like silver glimmering."") Who is she? This woman you sing of. 'Tis the lady of Luthien. The elf-maiden who gave her love to Beren, a mortal. What happened to her? She died. Get some sleep, Frodo. The power of Isengard is at your command... ... Sauron, Lord of the Earth. Build me an army worthy of Mordor. What orders from Mordor, my lord? What does the Eye command? We have work to do. The trees are strong, my lord. Their roots go deep. Rip them all down. This was the great watchtower of Amon Sl. We shall rest here tonight. These are for you. Keep them close. I'm going to have a look around. Stay here. My tomato's burst. Could I have some bacon? Want a tomato, Sam? - What are you doing?! - Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon. - We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo. - Put it out, you fools! - Put it out! - That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes! Go! Back, you devils! Frodo! Oh, Sam. Strider! - Help him, Strider. - He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade. This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs elvish medicine. Hurry! We're six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it! Hold on, Frodo. Gandalf! Gwaihir - Go. Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls. Mr. Frodo? He's going cold. Is he going to die? He's passing into the shadow world. He'll soon become a wraith like them. - They're close. - Sam, do you know the Athelas plant? - Athelas? - Kingsfoil. Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed. It may help to slow the poisoning. Hurry! What's this, a ranger caught off his guard? Frodo. Im Arwen - Telin le thaed. Lasto beth nn, tolo dan na ngalad. Who is she? Frodo. - She's an elf. - He's fading. He's not going to last. We must get him to my father. - I've been looking for you for two days. - Where are you taking him? There are five wraiths behind you. Where the other four are, I do not know. Dartho guin Berian. Rych le ad tolthathon. Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im. Andelu i ven. What are they saying? Frodo fr. Ae athradon i hr... ...tr gwaith nn beriatha hon. I do not fear them. Be iest ln. Arwen... ...ride hard. Don't Look back. What are you doing?! Those wraiths are still out there! Noro lim, Asfaloth! Give up the halfling, She-elf. If you want him, come and claim him. Nn o Chithaeglir... ...lasto beth daer Rimmo nn Bruinen dan in Ulaer! Nn o Chithaeglir... ...lasto beth daer Rimmo nn Bruinen dan in Ulaer! No. No! Frodo, no. Frodo, don't give in. Not now. What grace is given me... ...let it pass to him. Let him be spared. Save him. Lasto beth nn, tolo dan na ngalad. - Where am I? - You are in the house of Elrond. And it is 10 o'clock in the morning on October 24th, if you want to know. - Gandalf! - Yes, I'm here. And you're lucky to be here too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit. What happened, Gandalf? - Why didn't you meet us? - I am sorry, Frodo. I was delayed. A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside. One ill turn deserves another. It is over. Embrace the power of the ring... ...or embrace your own destruction! There is only one lord of the ring. Only one who can bend it to his will. And he does not share power. So you have chosen...death. Gandalf? What is it? Nothing, Frodo. Frodo! - Sam. - Bless you, you're awake! Sam has hardly left your side. We were that worried about you. Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf? By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend. Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins. - Bilbo! - Hello, Frodo, my lad. Bilbo. There and back again A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.'' - This is wonderful. - I meant to go back... ...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood... ...visit Lake-town... ...see the Lonely Mountain again. But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me. I miss the Shire. I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else. Off with you, on one of your adventures. But my own adventure turned out to be quite different. I'm not like you, Bilbo. My dear boy. - Now, what have I forgotten? - Packed already? No harm in being prepared. - I thought you wanted to see the elves. - I do. - More than anything. - I did. It's just.... We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we? We got the ring this far, to Rivendell. And I thought... ...seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. Off home. You are right, Sam. We did what we set out to do. The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am ready to go home. His strength returns. That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life. And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring... ...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil. It is a burden he should never have had to bear. - We can ask no more of Frodo. - Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's forces are massing in the East. His eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin. His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft, Saruman has crossed orcs with goblin-men. He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the ring. This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves. We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard! Gandalf... ...the ring cannot stay here. This peril belongs to all Middle-earth. They must decide now how to end it. The time of the elves is over. My people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we've gone? The dwarves? They hide in mountains seeking riches. They care not for the troubles of others. It is in men that we must place our hope. Men? Men are weak. The race of men is failing. The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of men the ring survives. I was there, Gandalf. I was there 3000 years ago... ... when Isildur took the ring. I was there the day the strength of men failed. Isildur, hurry! Follow me. I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom... ...where the ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed. Cast it into the fire! - Destroy it! - No. Isildur! It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the ring. The line of kings is broken. There's no strength left in the world of men. - They're scattered, divided, leaderless. - There is one who could unite them. One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor. He turned from that path a long time ago. He has chosen exile. You are no elf. Men of the South are welcome here. - Who are you? - I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey. Then we are here on common purpose... ...friend. The shards of Narsil. The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand. It's still sharp. But no more than a broken heirloom. Why do you fear the past? You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf. You are not bound to his fate. The same blood flows in my veins. The same weakness. Your time will come. You will face the same evil. And you will defeat it. A si i-Dhuath -orthor, Aragorn.  or le a  or nin. Renich i l i erui govannem? Nauthannen i ned l reniannen. Gwenwin in enninath. -'arnech in naeth i si celich. Renech i beth i pennen? You said you'd bind yourself to me... ...forsaking the immortal life of your people. And to that I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you... ...than face all the ages of this world alone. I choose a mortal life. - You cannot give me this. - It is mine to give to whom I will... ...like my heart. Strangers from distant lands, friends of old... ...you've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You will unite, or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom. Bring forth the ring, Frodo. So it is true. The ring of power... The doom of men... In a dream... ...I saw the eastern sky grow dark... ...but in the West a pale light lingered. A voice was crying: ""Your doom is near at hand. Isildur's bane is found."" Isildur s bane. Boromir! ""Ash nazg durbatulk... ...Ash nazg gimbatul... ...Ash nazg thrakatulk... ...agh burzum-ishi krimpatul."" Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris. I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond... ...for the black speech of Mordor... ...may yet be heard... ...in every corner of the West! The ring is altogether evil. It is a gift. A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor... ...kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the blood of our people... ...are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy. Let us use it against him. You cannot wield it. None of us can. The one ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master. And what would a ranger know of this matter? This is no mere ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance. Aragorn. This is Isildur s heir? And heir to the throne of Gondor. Havo dad, Legolas. Gondor has no king. Gondor needs no king. Aragorn is right. We cannot use it. You have only one choice. The ring must be destroyed. What are we waiting for? The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin... ...by any craft that we here possess. The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. Only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor... ...and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. Ash Nazg Durbatuluk... (One ring to rule them all...) One of you... ...must do this. One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep. The great eye is ever-watchful. It is a barren wasteland... ...riddled with fire, and ash and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with 10,000 men could you do this. It is folly. Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The ring must be destroyed. And I suppose you think you are the one to do it! And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his? I will be dead before I see the ring in the hands of an elf! Never trust an elf! Do you not understand? While you bicker amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows! None can escape it! You'll all be destroyed! Ash Nazg Durbatuluk (One ring to rule them all...) ...Ash nazg gimbatul... (...One ring to find them...) Ash Nazg Durbatuluk... (One ring to rule them all...) ...Ash nazg gimbatul... (...One ring to find them...) Ash Nazg Durbatuluk... (One ring to rule them all...) ...Ash nazg gimbatul... (...One ring to find them...) Ash Nazg Durbatuluk... (One ring to rule them all...) I will take it. I will take it. I will take the ring to Mordor. Though... ...I do not know the way. I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins... ...as long as it is yours to bear. If by my life or death I can protect you... ...I will. You have my sword. And you have my bow. And my ax. You carry the fates of us all, little one. If this is indeed the will of the Council... ...then Gondor will see it done. - Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me. - No indeed it is hardly possible to separate you... ...even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not. Oy. We're coming too! You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us. Anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of... ...mission. Quest. Thing. Well, that rules you out, Pip. Nine companions. So be it. You shall be: The Fellowship of the Ring. Great! Where are we going? Anirne hene beriad i chen ln. Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen. In her heart, your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life. That you'd never escape your fate. The skill of the elves can reforge the sword of kings... ...but only you have the power to wield it. I do not want that power. I have never wanted it. You are the last of that bloodline. There is no other. My old sword! Sting. Here, take it. Take it. - It's so light. - Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know. The blade glows blue when orcs are close. And it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful. Here's a pretty thing. Mithril. As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales. Let me see you put it on. Come on. My old ring. I should very much like... ...to hold it again, one last time. I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy. I'm sorry that you must carry this burden. I'm sorry for everything. The ring-bearer is setting out on the quest of Mount Doom. On you who travel with him, no oath... ...nor bond is laid to go further than you will. Farewell. Hold to your purpose. May the blessings of elves and men... ...and all free folk go with you. The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer. Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right? Left. We must hold to this course, west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days. If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us. From there, our road turns east to Mordor. Two, one, five. Good! Very good. Move your feet. - You look good, Pippin. - Thanks. Faster! If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they're not... ...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round. Gandalf. We could pass through the mines of Moria. My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome. No Gimli, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice. Sorry! Get him! - For the Shire! - Hold him. Hold him down, Merry! Gentlemen, that's enough. You've got my arm! You've got my arm! - What is that? - Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud. It's moving fast. Against the wind. - Crebain from Dunland! - Hide! - Hurry! - Take cover! Spies of Saruman. The passage south is being watched. We must take the pass of Caradhras. Frodo! Boromir. It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt... ...over so small a thing. Such a little thing. Boromir! Give the ring to Frodo. As you wish. I care not. So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails, where then will you go? If the mountain defeats you... ... will you risk a more dangerous road? Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse! There is a fell voice on the air. Nai yarvaxea rasselya! It's Saruman! He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf, we must turn back! No! Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i 'ruith! Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse! Nai yarvaxea rasselya... ...taltuva notto-carinnar! We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan, and take the west road to my city! The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard! We cannot pass over a mountain. Let us go under it. Let us go through the mines of Moria. Moria. You fear to go into those mines. The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dm: Shadow and flame. Let the ring-bearer decide. We cannot stay here! This will be the death of the hobbits. Frodo? We will go through the mines. So be it. Frodo, come and help an old man. How is your shoulder? - Better than it was. - And the ring? You feel its power growing, don't you? I've felt it too. You must be careful now. Evil will be drawn to you from outside the fellowship. And, I fear, from within. - Who then do I trust? - You must trust yourself. Trust your own strengths. - What do you mean? - There are many powers in this world... ...for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am. And against some I have not yet been tested. The walls... ...of Moria. Dwarf doors are invisible when closed. Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten. Why doesn't that surprise me? Well, let's see. Ithildin. It mirrors only starlight and moonlight. It reads; ""The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. - Speak, friend, and enter."" - What do you suppose that means? Oh It's quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open. Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen! ...lasto beth lammen. Nothing's happening. I once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves... ...men and orcs. What are you going to do, then? Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took! And if that does not shatter them... ...and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions... ...I will try to find the opening words. Ando Eldarinwa... ...a lasta quettanya... ...Fenda Casarinwa... Mines are no place for a pony. - Even one so brave as Bill. - Bye-bye, Bill. Fennas Nogothrim... Go on, Bill. Go on. Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home. Do not disturb the water. Oh, it's useless. It's a riddle. ""Speak 'friend' and enter."" What's the elvish word for ""friend""? Mellon. Soon, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves. Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone! This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin. And they call it a mine. A mine! This is no mine. It's a tomb. No.... No! Goblins. We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here. Now, get out of here. Get out! - Frodo! - Help! Strider! - Help! - Get off him! Aragorn! Frodo! Into the mines! - Legolas! - Into the cave! Run! We now have but one choice. We must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard. There are older and fouler things than orcs... ...in the deep places of the world. Quietly now. It's a four-day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed. The wealth of Moria was not in gold... ...or jewels... ...but mithril. Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him. - Oh, that was a kingly gift. - Yes. I never told him... ...but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire. Pippin. I have no memory of this place. - Are we Lost? - No. - I think we are. - Gandalf's thinking. - Merry? - What? I'm hungry. - There's something down there. - It's Gollum. - Gollum? - He's been following us for three days. - He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dr? - Escaped... ...or was set loose. Now the ring has brought him here. He will never be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himseIf. Smeagol's life is a sad story. Yes, Smeagol he was once called. Before the ring found him. Before it drove him mad. It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance. Pity? It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill... ...before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many. I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In which case, you also were meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought. It's that way. - He's remembered. - No. But the air doesn't smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose. Let me risk a little more light. Behold... ...the great realm and dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf. Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake. Gimli! No! Oh, no. No. ""Here lies Balin... ...son of Fundin... ...Lord of Moria."" He is dead, then. It's as I feared. We must move on. We cannot linger. ""They have taken the bridge and the second hall. We have barred the gates... ...but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums... ...drums in the deep. We cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. We cannot get out. They are coming."" Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity. Frodo! Orcs. Get back! Stay close to Gandalf! They have a cave-troll. Let them come! There is one dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath. I think I'm getting the hang of this. Frodo! Aragorn! Aragorn! Frodo! Frodo! Oh, no. He's alive. I'm all right. I'm not hurt. You should be dead. That spear would have skewered a wild boar. I think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye. Mithril. You are full of surprises, Master Baggins. To the bridge of Khazad-dm! This way! What is this new devilry? A Balrog. A demon of the ancient world. This foe is beyond any of you. Run! Quickly! Gandalf. Lead them on, Aragorn. The bridge is near. Do as I say! Swords are no more use here. Gandalf! Merry! Pippin! Sam! Nobody tosses a Dwarf. Not the beard! Steady. Hold on! Hang on! Lean forward! Steady. Come on! Now! Over the bridge! Fly! You cannot pass! Gandalf! I am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udn! Go back to the Shadow. YOU - SHALL NOT - PASS! - No! No! - Gandalf! Fly, you fools! No! Aragorn! Legolas, get them up. Give them a moment, for pity's sake! By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs. We must reach the woods of Lothlrien. Come, Boromir. Legolas. Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam. Frodo? Frodo! Stay close, young hobbits! They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods. An elf-witch... ...of terrible power. All who look upon her... ...fall under her spell. Frodo! And are never seen again. Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom. You bring great evil here, ring-bearer. Mr. Frodo? Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox. The dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark. Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion. Govannas vn gwennen le, Haldir o Lrien. A, Aragorn in Dnedain... ...istannen le ammen. Haldir. So much for the legendary courtesy of the elves! Speak words we can all understand! We have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days. And you know what this dwarf says to that? Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul! That was not so courteous. You bring great evil with you. You can go no further. Boe ammen veriad ln. Andelu i ven! Merin le telim. Henio, anron boe ammen i dulu ln! Aragorn! Merin le telim. Andelu i ven. Gandalf's death was not in vain. Nor would he have you give up hope. You carry a heavy burden, Frodo. Don't carry the weight of the dead. You will follow me. Cares Galeton. The heart of Elvendom on earth. Realm of the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light. The enemy knows you have entered here. What hope you had in secrecy is now gone. Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is Gandalf? For I much desire to speak with him. I can no longer see him from afar. Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land. He has fallen into shadow. He was taken by both shadow and flame. A Balrog of Morgoth. For we went needlessly into the net of Moria. Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. We do not yet know his full purpose. Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-dm fill your heart... ...Gimli, son of Gloin. For the world has grown full of peril... ...and in all lands... ...love is now mingled with grief. What now becomes of this fellowship? Without Gandalf, hope is lost. The quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail... ...to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while the company is true. Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest... ...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. Tonight, you will sleep.... Welcome, Frodo of the Shire... ...one who has seen the eye! A lament for Gandalf. What do they say about him? I have not the heart to tell you. For me, the grief is still too near. I bet they don't mention his fireworks. There should be a verse about them. The finest rockets ever seen They burst in stars of blue and green Or after thunder, silver showers Came falling like a rain of flowers Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road. Take some rest. These borders are well-protected. I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor. She said to me; ""Even now there is hope Left."" But I cannot see it. It is long since we had any hope. My father is a noble man. But his rule is failing... ...and our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right, and I would do it. I would see the glory of Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it, Aragorn? The white tower of Ecthelion. Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver. Its banners caught high in the morning breeze. Have you ever been called home... ...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets? I have seen the white city... ...long ago. One day, our paths will lead us there. And the tower guard shall take up the call: ""The Lords of Gondor have returned."" Will you look into the mirror? What will I see? Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror... ...shows many things. Things that were... ...things that are... ...and some things... ...that have not yet come to pass. I know what it is you saw. For it is also in my mind. It is what will come to pass if you should fail. The fellowship is breaking. It is already begun. He will try to take the ring. You know of whom I speak. One by one, it will destroy them all. If you ask it of me... ... I will give you the one ring. You offer it to me freely. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this. In place of a dark lord, you would have a queen... ...not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Treacherous as the sea! Stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me... ...and despair. I pass the test. I will diminish... ...and go into the West... ...and remain Galadriel. - I cannot do this alone. You are a ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a ring of power... ...is to be alone. This is Nenya, the ring of Adamant. And I am its keeper. This task was appointed to you. And if you do not find a way... ...no one will. Then I know what I must do. It's just... ...I'm afraid to do it. Even the smallest person can change the course of the future. Do you know how the orcs first came into being? They were elves once. Taken by the dark powers... ...tortured and mutilated. A ruined and terrible form of life. And now... ...perfected. My fighting Uruk-hai... ...whom do you serve? Saruman! Hunt them down. Do not stop until, they are found. You do not know pain. You do not know fear. You will taste man-flesh! One of the halflings carries something of great value. Bring them to me alive and unspoiled. Kill the others. Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people. May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes. Lembas. Elvish waybread. One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man. How many did you eat? Four. Every league you travel south, the danger will increase. Mordor orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin. Nor will you find safety on the western bank. Strange creatures bearing the mark of the white hand have been seen on our borders. Seldom do orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so. Le aphadar aen. By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the falls of Rauros. My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim. Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin. These are the daggers of the Noldorin. They have already seen service in war. Do not fear, young Peregrin Took. You will find your courage. And for you, Samwise Gamgee... ...Elven rope made of hithlain. Thank you, my lady. Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers? And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves? Nothing. Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time... ...for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth. Actually.... There was one thing. No, no, I couIdn't. It's quite impossible. Stupid to ask. I have nothing greater to give... ...than the gift you already bear. Am meleth dn... ...I ant e guil Arwen Undmiel pgatha. Anron i e broniatha, ad ae periatham... ...athar i methid en-amar hen. Anron i e cratha na Valannor. That choice is yet before her. You have your own choice to make, Aragorn. To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil... ...or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin. Namri. Nadath n i moe cerich. Dan, -'eveditham, Elessar. Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the light of Earendil... ...our most beloved star. May it be a light for you in dark places... ... when all other lights go out. I have taken my worst wound at this parting... ...having looked my last upon that which is fairest. Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me. What was her gift? I asked her for one hair from her golden head. She gave me three. Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria. I had hoped we would lose him on the river. But he's too clever a waterman. And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts... ...it will make the crossing even more dangerous. Have some food, Mr. Frodo. - No, Sam. - You haven't eaten anything all day. You're not sleeping, neither. Don't think I haven't noticed. - Mr. Frodo - I'm all right. But you're not. I'm here to help you. I promised Gandalf that I would. You can't help me, Sam. Not this time. Get some sleep. Minas Tirith is the safer road. You know that. From there we can regroup. Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength. There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us. You were quick enough to trust the elves. Have you so little faith in your own people? Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty. But there is courage also, and honor to be found in men. But you will not see that. You are afraid! All your life, you have hidden in the shadows. Scared of who you are, of what you are. I will not lead the ring within a hundred leagues of your city. Frodo. The Argonath. Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old. My kin. We cross the lake at nightfall. Hide the boats and continue on foot. - We approach Mordor from the North. - Oh, yes? Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil... ...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks. And after that, it gets even better. Festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see. That is our road. I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf. Recover my... - We should Leave now. - No. Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness. It is not the eastern shore that worries me. A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. Something draws near. I can feel it. Recover strength? Pay no heed to that, young hobbit. Where's Frodo? None of us should wander alone. You, least of all. So much depends on you. Frodo? I know why you seek solitude. You suffer. I see it day by day. You sure you do not suffer needlessly? There are other ways, Frodo. - Other paths that we might take. - I know what you would say. It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart. Warning...against what? We're all afraid, Frodo. But to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have... ...don't you see that is madness? - There is no other way. I ask only for the strength to defend my people! - If you would but lend me the ring. - No. - Why do you recoil? I am no thief. - You are not yourself. What chance do you think you have? They will find you. They will take the ring. And you will beg for death before the end! You fool! It is not yours, save by unhappy chance! It could have been mine. It should be mine! Give it to me! - Give it to me! - No! - Give it to me! - No. I see your mind. You will take the ring to Sauron! You will betray us! You'll go to your death, and the death of us all! Curse you! Curse you and all the halflings! Frodo? Frodo. What have I done? Please, Frodo. Frodo, I'm sorry! Ash Ghurm Frodo? - It has taken Boromir. - Where is the ring? Stay away! Frodo! - I swore to protect you. - Can you protect me from yourself? Would you destroy it? Aragorn. Aragorn. Elessar. I would have gone with you to the end. Into the very fires of Mordor. I know. Look after the others. Especially Sam. He will not understand. Go, Frodo! Run. Run! Mr. Frodo! Find the halfling! Find the halfling! Elendil! Aragorn, go! Frodo! Hide here. Quick! Come on! What's he doing? He's leaving. - No! - Pippin! Run, Frodo. Go! - Hey! Hey, you! - Over here! - Over here! - This way! - It's working! - I know it's working! Run! - The horn of Gondor. - Boromir. Run! No. - They took the little ones. - Hold still. Frodo. Where is Frodo? I let Frodo go. Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the ring from him. - The ring is beyond our reach now. - Forgive me. I did not see it. - I have failed you all. - No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You have kept your honor. Leave it. It is over. The world of men will fall and all will come to darkness... ...and my city to ruin. I do not know what strength is in my blood... ...but I swear to you, I will not let the white city fall... ...nor our people fail. Our people. Our people. I would have followed you, my brother. My captain. My king. Be at peace... ...son of Gondor. They will look for his coming from the white tower. But he will not return. Frodo! I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. So do all who live to see such times... ...but that is not for them to decide. All you have to decide... ...is what to do with the time that is given to you. Frodo, no! Frodo! - Mr. Frodo! - No, Sam. Go back, Sam! - I'm going to Mordor alone. - Of course you are. And I'm coming with you! You can't swim! Sam! Sam! I made a promise, Mr. Frodo. A promise: ""Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."" And I don't mean to. I don't mean to. Oh Sam. Come on. Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore. - You mean not to follow them. - Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands. Then it has all been in vain. The fellowship has failed. Not if we hold true to each other. We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death. Not while we have strength left. Leave all that can be spared behind. We travel light. Let us hunt some orc. Yes! Mordor. I hope the others find a safer road. Strider will look after them. I don't suppose we'll ever see them again. We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may. Sam... ...I'm glad you are with me., Edmund! Get away from there! Peter! What do you think you're doing? Peter, quickly, the shelter. Now! - Come on! - Wait... Come on, leave it! Mommy! Lucy, come on! - Come on, quickly! - Run! Run! - Hurry! - Mum! - Wait! Dad! - Ed! - Edmund, no! - I'll get him! - Peter, come back! - Ed! Come here! Edmund! Get down! Come on, you idiot, run! Get out! Come on! Hurry! Why can't you think of anyone but yourself? You're so selfish! - You could've got us killed! - Stop it! It's OK. Shh. Why can't you just do as you're told? Alms for the poor. Alms for the poor. God bless you, sir. Children and evacuation staff... You need to keep this on, darling. All right? You warm enough? Good girl. Say hello to Auntie Laura. Goodbye, darling, we love you. If Dad were here, he wouldn't make us go. If Dad were here, it'd mean the war was over and we wouldn't have to. You will listen to your brother, won't you, Edmund? Promise me you'll look after the others. I will, Mum. - Good man. - All aboard! All aboard! - Bye, darling! - Bye! Susan. Be a big girl. Hold on to your brother's hand. Don't let it go. All right. Off you go. - All aboard! - Bye-bye. Love you. Hey, get off. I know how to get on a train by myself. Get off me! May I have your tickets, please? Tickets, please. Peter. - That's right. On you go. - Yes. Thank you. Come along. Come along this way, please. Come on, Lucy. We have to stick together now. Everything's gonna be all right. It's gonna be fine. Bye, Mommy! I love you! - Bye-bye, dear. - Bye! We'll miss you! See you soon. - I love you, Mum! Bye! - See you soon! - Write to us, Mum! - Love you! Goosey Station. Goosey Station. Give me your hand. Let's get going. The professor knew we were coming. Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled. Come on, hup! And whoa. Whoa. - Mrs. Macready? - I'm afraid so. Is this it, then? Haven't you brought anything else? No, ma'am. It's just us. Small favors. Come on. Good girl. Come on. Come on. Professor Kirke is not accustomed to havin' children in this house. And, as such, there are a few rules we need to follow. There will no shoutin'. Or runnin'. No improper use of the dumbwaiter. No touchin' of the historical artifacts! And above all, there shall be no disturbin' of the professor. German aircraft carried out a number of attacks on Great Britain last night. The raids, which lasted for several hours... The sheets feel scratchy. Wars don't last forever, Lucy. We'll be home soon. - Yeah, if home's still there. - Isn't it time you were in bed? - Yes, Mum. - Ed! You saw outside. This place is huge. We can do whatever we want here. Tomorrow's going to be great. Really. ""Gastrovascular."" Come on, Peter. Gastrovascular. - Is it Latin? - Yes. Is it Latin for ""worst game ever invented""? We could play hide and seek. But we're already having so much fun. Come on, Peter, please. Pretty please? - One, two, three, four... - What? ...five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11... I was here first! Were you hiding from me? No. Uh, well... I just... I... No. No. I-I-I just... I was just, um... I didn't want to scare you. If you don't mind my asking... what are you? Well, I'm a... Well, I'm a faun. And what about you? You must be some kind of beardless dwarf? I'm not a dwarf! I'm a girl! And, actually, I'm tallest in my class. You mean to say that you're a Daughter of Eve? Well, my mum's name is Helen. Yes, but you are in fact human. Yes, of course. What are you doing here? Well, I was hiding in the wardrobe in the spare room, and... Spare Oom? Is that in Narnia? Narnia? What's that? Well, dear girl, you're in it. Everything from the lamppost all the way to Castle Cair Paravel on the Eastern Ocean, every stick and stone you see, every icicle is Narnia. This is an awfully big wardrobe. War Drobe? I'm sorry. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tumnus. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus. I'm Lucy Pevensie. - Oh, you shake it. - Uh... Why? I... I don't know. People do it when they meet each other. Well, then, Lucy Pevensie from the shining city of War Drobe in the wondrous land of Spare Oom, how would it be if you came and had tea with me? Well, thank you very much, but I... I probably should be getting back. It's only just around the corner. And there'll be a glorious fire with toast and tea and cakes. And, perhaps, we'll even break into the sardines. - I don't know. - Come on. It's not every day that I get to make a new friend. Well, I suppose I could come for a little while. If you have sardines. By the bucketload. - You all right? - Mm-hm. Well, here we are. Come along. - After you. - May I help you with that? - Thank you very much. - Oh. Oh. Now, that... that is my father. He has a nice face. He looks a lot like you. No. No, I'm not very much like him at all, really. My father's fighting in the war. My father went away to war too. But that was a long, long time ago. - Before this dreadful winter. - Winter's not all bad. There's ice skating and snowball fights. - Oh! And Christmas! - Not here. No. No, we haven't had a Christmas in a hundred years. What? No presents for a hundred years? Always winter, never Christmas. It's been a long winter. But you would have loved Narnia in summer. We fauns danced with the dryads all night, and, you know, we never got tired. And music. Oh, such music! Would... would you like to hear some now? Oh! Yes, please. Now, are you familiar - with any Narnian lullabies? - Sorry, no. Well, that's good. Because this... probably won't sound anything like one. - Oh, I should go. - It's too late for that now. I'm such a terrible faun. Oh, no. You're the nicest faun I've ever met. Then I'm afraid you've had a very poor sampling. No. You can't have done anything that bad. It's not something I have done, Lucy Pevensie. It's something I am doing. What are you doing? I'm kidnapping you. It was the White Witch. She's the one who makes it always winter, always cold. She gave orders. If any of us ever find a human wandering in the woods, we're supposed to turn it over to her. But, Mr. Tumnus, you wouldn't. I thought you were my friend. Now. She may already know you're here. The woods are full of her spies. Even some of the trees are on her side. Can you find your way back from here? - I think so. - All right. Will you be all right? Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Here. Keep it. You need it more than I do. No matter what happens, Lucy Pevensie, I am glad to have met you. You've made me feel warmer than I've felt in a hundred years. Now go. Go! Ready or not, here I come! It's all right! I'm back! I'm all right! Shut up! He's coming! You know, I'm not sure you two have quite got the idea of this game. Weren't you wondering where I was? That's the point. That was why he was seeking you. Does this mean I win? I don't think Lucy wants to play anymore. I've been gone for hours. Lucy, the only wood in here is the back of the wardrobe. One game at a time, Lu. We don't all have your imagination. But I wasn't imagining! That's enough, Lucy. I wouldn't lie about this! Well, I believe you. - You do? - Yeah, of course. Didn't I tell you about the field in the cupboards? Will you just stop? You just have to make everything worse, don't you? - It was just a joke! - When are you gonna learn to grow up? Shut up! You think you're Dad, but you're not! Well, that was nicely handled. But... it really was there. Susan's right, Lucy. That's enough. Lucy. Where are you? Boo! Lucy. Hope you're not afraid of the dark. Lucy? Lucy? Lucy! Lucy. Where are you? Lucy. I think I believe you now. Lucy. Lucy? Oh! - Leave me alone! - What is it now, Ginarrbrik? Make him let me go! I didn't do anything wrong! How dare you address the Queen of Narnia? I didn't know! - You will know her better hereafter! - Wait! What is your name, Son of Adam? Uh, Edmund. And how, Edmund, did you come to enter my dominion? I'm not sure. I was just following my sister. - Your sister? How many are you? - Four. Lucy's the only one that's been here before. She said she met some faun called Tumnus. Peter and Susan didn't believe her. I didn't either. Edmund, you look so cold. Will you come and sit with me? Now, how about something hot to drink? Yes, please, Your Majesty. Your drink, sire. How did you do that? I can make anything you like. Can you make me taller? Anything you'd like to eat. Turkish delight? Edmund? I would very much like to meet the rest of your family. Why? They're nothing special. Oh, I'm sure they're not nearly as delightful as you are. But you see, Edmund, I have no children of my own. And you are exactly the sort of boy who I could see, one day, becoming Prince of Narnia. Maybe even King. Really? Of course, you'd have to bring your family. Oh. Do you mean, Peter would be king too? No! No, no. But a king needs servants. I guess I could bring 'em. Beyond these woods, you see those two hills? My house is right between them. You'd love it there, Edmund. It has whole rooms simply stuffed with Turkish delight. - Couldn't I have some more now? - No! Don't want to ruin your appetite. Besides, you and I are going to be seeing each other again very soon. I hope so, Your Majesty. Until then, dear one. Mmm, I'm gonna miss you. Yah! Yah! Yah! Edmund? Oh, Edmund! You got in too! Isn't it wonderful? - Where have you been? - With Mr. Tumnus. He's fine. The White Witch hasn't found out anything about him meeting me. The White Witch? She calls herself the Queen of Narnia, but she really isn't. Are you all right? You look awful. Well, what'd you expect? I mean, it's freezing. - How do we get out of here? - Come on. This way. Peter, Peter, wake up! Peter, wake up! - It's there! It's really there! - Shh. - Lucy, what are you talking about? - Narnia! It's all in the wardrobe like I told you! - You've just been dreaming, Lucy. - But I haven't! I saw Mr. Tumnus again! And this time Edmund went too. You... You saw the faun? Well, he didn't actually go there with me. He... What were you doing, Edmund? I was just playing along. I'm sorry, Peter. I shouldn't have encouraged her, but you know what little children are like these days. They just don't know when to stop pretending. Ow! Oh! You children are one shenanigan shy of sleepin' in the stable! Professor. I'm sorry. I told them you were not to be disturbed. It's all right, Mrs. Macready. I'm sure there's an explanation. But first of all, I think this one is in need of a little hot chocolate. Come along, dear. You seem to have upset the delicate internal balance of my housekeeper. We're very sorry, sir. It won't happen again. It's our sister, sir. Lucy. - The weeping girl. - Yes, sir. - She's upset. - Hence the weeping. It's nothing. - We can handle it. - Oh, I can see that. She thinks she's found a magical land. In the upstairs wardrobe. What did you say? Um, the wardrobe, upstairs. Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside. She won't stop going on about it. - What was it like? - Like talking to a lunatic. No, no, no, not her. The forest. - You're not saying you believe her? - You don't? But of course not. I mean, logically, it's impossible. What do they teach in schools these days? Edmund said they were only pretending. He's usually the more truthful one, is he? No. This would be the first time. Well, if she's not mad and she's not lying, then logically we must assume she's telling the truth. You're saying that we should just believe her? She's your sister, isn't she? You're her family. You might just try acting like one. Peter winds up, poised to take yet another wicket! Ow! Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream. Why can't we play hide and seek again? I thought you said it was a kid's game. Besides, we could all use the fresh air. It's not like there isn't air inside. - Are you ready? - Are you? - Well done, Ed. - You bowled it! - What on earth is goin' on? - The Macready! Come on! No, no, back, back, back! - Come on! - Oh, you've got to be joking. Get back! - My toe! - I'm not on your toe! - Move back. - Will you stop shoving? Impossible. Don't worry. I'm sure it's just your imagination. I don't suppose saying we're sorry - would quite cover it. - No. It wouldn't. - But that might! - Oh! Oh! Ow! Stop it! You little liar. - You didn't believe her, either. - Apologize to Lucy. - Say you're sorry. - All right! I'm sorry. That's all right. Some children just don't know when to stop pretending. Oh, very funny. Maybe we should go back. But shouldn't we at least take a look around? I think Lucy should decide. I'd like you all to meet Mr. Tumnus! Well, then Mr. Tumnus it is. But we can't go hiking in the snow dressed like this. No. But I'm sure the professor wouldn't mind us using these. Anyway, if you think about it logically, we're not even taking them out of the wardrobe. - But that's a girl's coat! - I know. ...lots and lots of lovely food, and we'll have lots and lots of... Lu? Lucy! Who would do something like this? ""The Faun Tumnus is hereby charged with High Treason against Her lmperial Majesty, Jadis, Queen of Narnia, for comforting her enemies and fraternizing with humans. Signed Maugrim, Captain of the Secret Police. Long Live the Queen."" All right. Now we really should go back. But what about Mr. Tumnus? If he was arrested just for being with a human, - I don't think there's much we can do. - You don't understand, do you? I'm the human. She must have found out he helped me. - Maybe we could call the police. - These are the police. Don't worry, Lu. We'll think of something. Why? I mean, he's a criminal. Psst. Did that bird just ""psst"" us? It... It's a beaver. Here, boy. Here, boy. I ain't gonna smell it, if that's what you want. Oh. Sorry. Lucy Pevensie? Yes? Hey, that's the hankie I gave to Mr. Tum... Tumnus. He got it to me just before they took him. Is he all right? Further in. - What are you doing? - She's right. How do we know we can trust him? He said he knows the faun. He's a beaver. He shouldn't be saying anything! Everything all right? Yes. We were just talking. That's better left for safer quarters. He means the trees. Come on. We don't want to be caught out here after nightfall. Ah, blimey! Looks like the old girl has got the kettle on. Nice cup o' Rosy Lee. - It's lovely. - It's merely a trifle. Still plenty to do. Ain't quite finished it yet. It'll look the business when it is, though. Beaver, is that you? I've been worried sick! If I find you've been out with Badger again, I... Oh! Well, those aren't badgers. Oh, I never thought I'd live to see this day. Look at my fur. You couldn't give me ten minutes warning? I'd have given a week if I thought it would've helped. Oh, come inside, and we'll see if we can't get you some food, and some civilized company. Now, careful. Watch your step. Excuse the mess. Can't get Mr. Beaver to get out of his chair. Enjoyin' the scenery, are we? Isn't there anything we can do to help Tumnus? They'll have taken him to the Witch's. You know what they say. There's few that go through them gates that come out again. Fish 'n' chips? But there is hope, dear. Lots of hope. Oh, yeah, there's a right bit more than hope! Aslan is on the move. Who's Aslan? Who's Aslan? You cheeky little blighter. What? - You don't know, do you? - We haven't exactly been here long. Well, he's only the king of the whole wood. The top geezer. The real King of Narnia. - He's been away for a long while. - But he's just got back! And he's waitin' for you near the Stone Table! - He's waiting for us? - You're bloomin' joking! They don't even know about the prophecy! - Well, then... - Look. Aslan's return, Tumnus' arrest, the secret police, it's all happening because of you! - You're blaming us? - No! Not blaming. - Thanking you. - There's a prophecy. ""When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone sits at Cair Paravel in throne, the evil time will be over and done."" - That doesn't really rhyme. - I know it don't. You're kinda missin' the point! It has long been foretold that two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve will defeat the White Witch and restore peace to Narnia. And you think we're the ones? You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's already fitted out your army. - Our army? - Mum sent us away so we wouldn't get caught up in a war. I think you've made a mistake. - We're not heroes. - We're from Finchley. Hmm. Thank you for your hospitality. - But we really have to go. - No, you can't just leave! He's right. We have to help Mr. Tumnus. It's out of our hands. I'm sorry, but it's time the four of us were getting home. Ed? Ed? - I'm gonna kill him. - You may not have to. Has Edmund ever been to Narnia before? Hurry! - Edmund! - Shh! They'll hear you! No! - Get off! - You're playing into her hands. - We can't just let him go! - He's our brother! He's the bait! The Witch wants all four of you! - Why? - To stop the prophecy from coming true. To kill you! - This is all your fault. - My fault? None of this would have happened if you had listened to me! - You knew this would happen. - I didn't know. Which is why we should have left while we could! Stop it! - This isn't going to help Edmund. - She's right. Only Aslan can help your brother now. Then take us to him. Be still, stranger, or you'll never move again. - Who are you? - I'm Edmund! I met the Queen in the woods! She told me to come back here! I'm a Son of Adam! Hmm. My apologies, fortunate favorite of the queen. Or else, not so fortunate. Right this way. Wait here. Like it? Uh... Yes, Your Majesty. I thought you might. Tell me, Edmund... Are your sisters deaf? No. And your brother, is he... ...unintelligent? Well, I think so. But Mum says... Then how dare you come alone?! - I tried! - Edmund, I asked so little of you. - They just don't listen to me! - You couldn't even do that. I did bring them halfway. They're at the little house at the dam with the Beavers. Well. I suppose you're not a total loss then, are you? Well, I was wondering, could I maybe have some more Turkish delight now? Our guest is hungry. This way for your num-nums. Maugrim? You know what to do. Hurry, Mother! They're after us! - Oh, right then. - What's she doing? Oh, you'll be thanking me later. It's a long journey and Beaver gets pretty cranky when he's hungry. I'm cranky now! Take them. - Do you think we'll need jam? - Only if the Witch serves toast. Hurry. Badger and me dug this. Comes out right near his place. You told me it led to your mum's! Lucy! They're in the tunnel. - Quick! This way. - Hurry! - Run! - Quick! Quick! Quick! You should have brought a map! There wasn't room next to the jam. Come on, Lucy! I'm so sorry, dear. He was my best mate. What happened here? This is what becomes of those who cross the Witch. You take one more step, traitor, and I'll chew you to splinters! Relax. I'm one of the good guys. Yeah? Well, you look an awful lot like one of the bad ones. An unfortunate family resemblance. But we can argue breeding later. Right now we've got to move. What did you have in mind? Greetings, gents. - Lost something, have we? - Don't patronize me! I know where your allegiance lies. We're looking for some humans. Humans? Here in Narnia? That's a valuable bit of information, don't you think? Your reward is your life. It's not much, but still. Where are the fugitives? North. They ran north. Smell them out. They were helping Tumnus. The Witch got here before I did. Ow! Oh! Are you all right? Well, I wish I could say their bark was worse than their bite. Ow! Stop squirming! You're worse than Beaver on bath day. Worst day of the year. Thank you for your kindness, but that's all the cure I have time for. You're leaving? It has been a pleasure, My Queen, and an honor, but time is short and Aslan himself has asked me to gather more troops. - You've seen Aslan? - What's he like? Like everything we've ever heard. You'll be glad to have him by your side in the battle against the Witch. But we're not planning on fighting any witch. But surely, King Peter, the prophecy! We can't go to war without you. We just want our brother back. If... If you're not going to eat that... I'd get up, but... ...but my legs. Mr. Tumnus. What's left of him. - You're Lucy Pevensie's brother. - I'm Edmund. Yes. Yes, you have the same nose. Is your sister all right? Is she safe? I don't know. My police tore that dam apart. Your little family are nowhere to be found. - Where did they go? - I don't know! Then you're of no further use to me. Wait! The beaver said something about Aslan! Aslan? Where? - I... - He's a stranger here, Your Majesty. He can't be expected to know anything. I said... where is Aslan? I... I don't know. I left before they said anything. I wanted to see you! Guard! Your Majesty. Release the faun. Ah! Ah! Do you know why you're here, faun? Because I believe in a free Narnia. You're here... ...because he turned you in. For sweeties. Take him upstairs. And ready my sleigh. Edmund misses his family. Now, Aslan's camp is near the Stone Table - just across the frozen river. - River? The river's been frozen solid for a hundred years. - It's so far. - It's the world, dear. Did you expect it to be small? Smaller. When you're ready, Son of Adam. Yah! Yah! Yah! Come on, humans! While we're still young. If he tells us to hurry one more time, I'm gonna turn him into a big, fluffy hat. Hurry up! Come on! - He is getting a little bossy. - Behind you! It's her! - Run! Run! - Run! Hurry! Inside! Dive! Dive! Quick! Quick, quick, quick! Maybe she's gone. - I suppose I'll go look. - No! You're worth nothing to Narnia dead. Well, neither are you, Beaver. Thanks, sweetheart. - What's that? What's... - Shh, shh, shh. Come out! Come out! I hope you've all been good 'cause there's someone here to see you! Merry Christmas, sir. It certainly is, Lucy, since you have arrived. Look, I've put up with a lot since I got here, but this... - We thought you were the Witch. - Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that, but in my defense, I have been driving one of these longer than the Witch. I thought there was no Christmas in Narnia. No. For a long time. But the hope that you have brought, Your Majesties, is finally starting to weaken the Witch's power. Still, I dare say you could do with these. Presents! The juice of the fire-flower. One drop will cure any injury. And though I hope you never have to use it... Thank you, sir, but I think I could be brave enough. I'm sure you could. But battles are ugly affairs. Susan. Trust in this bow and it will not easily miss. What happened to ""battles are ugly affairs""? Though you don't seem to have a problem making yourself heard, blow on this and wherever you are, help will come. Thanks. Peter. The time to use these may be near at hand. Thank you, sir. These are tools, not toys. Bear them well and wisely. Now, I must be off. Winter is almost over, and things do pile up when you've been gone a hundred years. Long live Aslan! And Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - See you next year! - Goodbye! Told you he was real. He said winter was almost over. You know what that means. No more ice. - We need to cross, now! - Don't beavers make dams? - I'm not that fast, dear. - Come on! Wait! Will you think about this for a minute? - We don't have a minute. - I'm just trying to be realistic. No, you're trying to be smart. As usual. Wait. Maybe I should go first. Maybe you should. You've been sneaking second helpings, haven't you? Well, you never know which meal's gonna be your last. Especially with your cooking. If Mum knew what we were doing... Mum's not here. Oh, no! Run! Hurry! No! Peter! Put that down, boy. - Someone could get hurt. - Don't worry about me! Run him through! Leave now while you can, and your brother leaves with you. Stop, Peter! Maybe we should listen to him! Smart girl. Don't listen to him! Kill him! Kill him now! Oh, come on. This isn't your war. All my Queen wants is for you to take your family and go. Look, just because some man in a red coat hands you a sword, it doesn't make you a hero! Just drop it! No, Peter! Narnia needs you! Gut him while you still have a chance! What's it gonna be, Son of Adam? I won't wait forever. And neither will the river. Peter! Hold onto me! Lovely. What have you done? Lucy! Lucy! Has anyone seen my coat? Don't you worry, dear. Your brother's got you well looked after. And I don't think you'll be needing those coats anymore. It's so warm out. I'll go and check the sleigh. Your Majesty. We found the traitor. He was rallying your enemies near the Shuddering Woods. Ah. Nice of you to drop in. You were so helpful to my wolves last night. Perhaps you can help me now. - Forgive me, Your Majesty. - Oh, don't waste time with flattery. Not to seem rude, but I wasn't actually talking to you. Where are the humans headed? Wait! No! Don't. The beaver said something about the Stone Table, and that Aslan had an army there. An army? Thank you, Edmund. I'm glad this creature got to see some honesty... ...before he dies. - No! Think about whose side you're on, Edmund. Mine... ...or theirs. Go on ahead. Gather the faithful. If it's a war Aslan wants... ...it's a war he shall get. Why are they all staring at us? Maybe they think you look funny. Oi, stop your fussing. You look lovely. We have come to see Aslan. Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam. Welcome, Susan and Lucy, Daughters of Eve. And welcome to you, Beavers. You have my thanks. But where is the fourth? That's why we're here, sir. We need your help. We had a little trouble along the way. Our brother's been captured by the White Witch. Captured? How could this happen? He betrayed them, Your Majesty. - Then he has betrayed us all! - Peace, Oreius. I'm sure there's an explanation. It's my fault, really. I was too hard on him. We all were. Sir, he's our brother. I know, dear one. But that only makes the betrayal all the worse. This may be harder than you think. That is Cair Paravel, the castle of the four thrones. In one of which you will sit, Peter, as High King. You doubt the prophecy? No. That's just it. Aslan, I'm not what you all think I am. Peter Pevensie, formerly of Finchley. Beaver also mentioned that you planned on turning him into a hat. Peter, there is a Deep Magic, more powerful than any of us, that rules over all of Narnia. It defines right from wrong, and governs all our destinies. Yours... and mine. But I couldn't even protect my own family. You've brought them safely this far. Not all of them. Peter, I will do what I can to help your brother, but I need you to consider what I ask of you. I, too, want my family safe. Is our little prince uncomfortable? Does he want his pillow fluffed? Special treatment for the special boy! Isn't that what you wanted? You look like Mum. Mum hasn't had a dress like this since before the war. We should bring her one back. A whole trunk full! If we ever get back. I'm sorry I'm like that. We used to have fun together, didn't we? Yes. Before you got boring. Oh, really? Please don't try to run. - We're tired. - And we prefer to kill you quickly. Susan! Get back! Peter! Ah! Come on. We've already been through this before. We both know you haven't got it in you. Peter! Watch out! No! Stay your weapons. This is Peter's battle. You may think you're a king, but you're going to die... ...like a dog! - Look out! Peter! After him. He'll lead you to Edmund. Peter. Clean your sword. Rise, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane, Knight of Narnia. The minotaurs will take the left flanks. We'll keep the giants in reserve and send the dwarfs in first. Ah! The prisoner! You're not going to kill me? Not yet. We have work to do. Edmund! What's done is done. There is no need to speak to Edmund about what is past. Hello. - Are you all right? - I'm a little tired. Get some sleep. And Edmund... ...try not to wander off. Narnia's not going to run out of toast, Ed. I'm sure they'll pack something up for the journey back. We're going home? You are. I promised Mum I'd keep you three safe. But it doesn't mean I can't stay behind and help. But they need us. All four of us. Lucy, it's too dangerous. You almost drowned! Edmund was almost killed! Which is why we have to stay. I've seen what the White Witch can do. And I've helped her do it. And we can't leave these people behind to suffer for it. I suppose that's it then. Where are you going? To get in some practice. Come on, Ed! Sword point up, like Oreius showed us. - En garde! - Now block. - Hey! - Peter! Edmund! Whoa, horsie! - My name is Philip. - Oh. Sorry. The Witch has demanded a meeting with Aslan. She's on her way here. Jadis, the Queen of Narnia! - Go away, Witch! - Empress of the Lone Islands! You don't belong here! Go away! You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan. His offense was not against you. Have you forgotten the laws upon which Narnia was built? Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch. I was there when it was written. Then you'll remember well that every traitor belongs to me. His blood is my property. Try and take him then. Do you really think that mere force will deny me my right... ...little King? Aslan knows that unless I have blood, as the law demands, all of Narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water. That boy will die on the Stone Table... ...as is tradition. You dare not refuse me. Enough. I shall talk with you alone. She has renounced her claim on the Son of Adam's blood. How do I know your promise will be kept? - Susan! - Mm? Shouldn't you both be in bed? We couldn't sleep. Please, Aslan. Couldn't we come with you? I would be glad of the company for a while. Thank you. It is time. From here, I must go on alone. But Aslan... You have to trust me. For this must be done. Thank you, Susan. Thank you, Lucy. And farewell. Behold. The great lion. Do you want some milk? Why doesn't he fight back? Bind him! Tie him up! Get him! Wait! Let him first be shaved. Bring him to me. You know, Aslan, I'm a little disappointed in you. Did you honestly think by all this that you could save the human traitor? You are giving me your life and saving no one. So much for love. Tonight... ...the Deep Magic will be appeased! But tomorrow, we will take Narnia forever! In that knowledge, despair... ...and die! The Great Cat... ...is dead! General. Prepare your troops for battle. However short it may be. It's too late. He's gone. He must have known what he was doing. Get away! Get away, all of you! No. Look. We have to tell the others. - We can't just leave him! - Lucy, there's no time. They need to know. The trees. Be still, my Princes. I bring grave news from your sisters. She's right. He's gone. Then you'll have to lead us. Peter, there's an army out there and it's ready to follow you. - I can't. - Aslan believed you could. And so do I. The Witch's army is nearing, sire. What are your orders? They come, Your Highness, in numbers and weapons far greater than our own. Numbers do not win a battle. No. But I bet they help. I have no interest in prisoners. Kill them all. Ahh! Go on! Look to the sky! Are you with me? To the death. For Narnia and for Aslan! Go! Go! For Aslan! We should go. I'm so cold. Ah! Susan! Where's Aslan? What have they done? Aslan! But we saw the knife. The Witch. If the Witch knew the true meaning of sacrifice, she might have interpreted the Deep Magic differently. That when a willing victim who has committed no treachery is killed in a traitor's stead, the Stone Table will crack and even death itself will turn backwards. We sent the news that you were dead. Peter and Edmund will have gone to war. We have to help them. We will, dear one, but not alone. Climb on my back. We have far to go and little time to get there. And you may want to cover your ears. Fire! Yes! Fall back! Draw them to the rocks! That's the signal. Come on! Where are we going? Hang on! Fall back! Go on, fall back! Stop! Susan, this is... Mr. Tumnus! Come, we must hurry and search the castle. Peter will need everyone we can find. Ah! Edmund! There's too many! Get out of here! Get the girls and get them home! You heard him! Let's go! Peter said get out of here! Peter's not king yet. Ah! Impossible! Ah! It is finished. - Peter! - Peter! Where's Edmund? Edmund! Ah! When are you gonna learn to do as you're told? To the glistening Eastern Sea, I give you Queen Lucy the Valiant. To the great Western Wood, King Edmund the Just. To the radiant Southern Sun, Queen Susan, the Gentle. And to the clear Northern Sky, I give you King Peter, the Magnificent. Once a King or Queen of Narnia, always a King or Queen. May your wisdom grace us until the stars rain down from the heavens. Long live King Peter! Long live King Edmund! Long live Queen Susan! Long live Queen Lucy! Don't worry. We'll see him again. - When? - In time. One day he'll be here and the next he won't. But you mustn't press him. After all, he's not a tame lion. No. But he is good. Here. You need it more than I do. Are you all right, Philip? I'm not as young as I once was. Come on, Ed. - Just catching my breath. - That's all we'll catch at this rate. - What did he say, Susan? - ""Wait in the castle. I'll get the stag myself."" What's this? It seems familiar. As if from a dream. Or a dream of a dream. Spare Oom. - Lucy! - Not again. - Lu? - Come on! These aren't branches. Ow! Ooh! - They're coats. - Susan, you're on my foot! Peter, move off! - Stop shoving. - Stop it! I'm not on your toe! Oh! There you are. What were you all doing in the wardrobe? You wouldn't believe us if we told you, sir. Try me. I don't think you'll get back in that way. You see... I've already tried. Will we ever go back? Oh, I expect so. But it'll probably happen when you're not looking for it. All the same... best to keep your eyes open., Lock on to him, R2. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead- Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead- the one crawling with vulture droids. I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy. - Oddball, do you copy? - Copy, Red Leader. Mark my position. Form your squad up behind me. We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position. This is where the fun begins. Let them pass between us. They're all over me. - Get them off my- - I'm gonna go help them out. No. They are doing theirjob so we can do ours. Missiles. Pull up. - They overshot us. - They're coming around. All right, R4. No, no. Nothing too fancy. Surge all power units, R2. Stand by reverse thrusters. We got 'em, R2. Flying is for droids. - I'm hit. Anakin? - I see them. Buzz droids. R4, be careful. You have a- Oh, dear. They're shutting down all the controls. Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them. The mission. Get to the command ship. Get the chancellor. I'm running out of tricks here. In the name of- - Hold your fire! You're not helping. - I agree. Bad idea. I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me. Anakin! - Move to the right. - Hold on. You'll get us both killed. Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do. I'm not leaving without you, Master. Get him, R2. Watch out. R2, hit the buzz droid's centre eye. - Yeah, you got him! - Great, R2. The general's command ship is dead ahead. Have you noticed the shields are still up? Sorry, Master. I have a bad feeling about this. There they are. Get them. R2, locate the chancellor. The chancellor's signal is coming from right there- the observation platform at the top of that spire. I sense Count Dooku. - I sense a trap. - Next move? Spring the trap. R2, go back. I need you to stay with the ship. Here. Take this and wait for orders. What's the situation, Captain? Two Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay. We're tracking them. Just as Count Dooku predicted. Destroyers. Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em. - Roger. - Roger, roger. Those are Jedi fighters all right. - Did you press the stop button? - No. Did you? There's more than one way out of here. We don't want to get out. We want to get moving. R2, activate elevator 31174. - Come in, R2. - What that? R2, do you copy? R2, activate the elevator number 31174. Get back to work. That nothin'. Activate the elevator 31174. R2- Always on the move. R2, switch on the comlink. R2, can you hear me? R2? R2! R2! Stop. Stop. R2, we need to be going up. Hands up,Jedi. R2, do you copy? R2, do you hear me? R2, we need to be going up, not down. Hey, you! That's better. You stupid little astro droid. Oh, it's you. My eyes! My eyes! - What was that all about? - R2 has been- - No loose wire jokes. - Did I say anything? - He's trying. - I didn't say anything. - Chancellor. - Are you all right? Count Dooku. - This time we will do it together. - I was about to say that. Get help. You're no match for him. He's a Sith lord. Chancellor Palpatine, Sith lords are our speciality. Your swords, please. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the chancellor. You won't get away this time, Dooku. I've been looking forward to this. My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count. Good. Twice the pride, double the fall. Get- I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate. You have anger. But you don't use them. Good, Anakin. Good. Kill him. Kill him now. I shouldn't. Do it. You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive. Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. I shouldn't have done that. It's not the Jedi way. It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People? Now we must leave before more security droids arrive. Anakin, there's no time. We must get off this ship before it's too late. - He seems to be all right. - Leave him, or we'll never make it. His fate will be the same as ours. Prepare for attack! All batteries, fire! Fire! Elevator's not working. R2, activate elevator 3224. - Reverse stabilizers. - Reversing stabilizers. Magnetize! Magnetize! Fire the emergency booster engines. We're levelling out, sir. Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here. - Did I miss something? - Hold on. - What is that? - Oops. R2. R2, shut down the elevator. Too late.Jump! Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. R2, get down here. R2, do you copy? General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328. Activate ray shields. Ray shields. Wait a minute. How did this happen? We're smarter than this. Apparently not. - I say patience. - Patience? Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments... and then he'll release the ray shields. See? No problem. Don't move. Do you have a plan B? Ah, yes. The negotiator. General Kenobi. We've been waiting for you. Excuse me. - That wasn't much of a rescue. - You're welcome. And- Anakin Skywalker. I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little... older. General Grievous. You're shorter than I expected. Jedi scum. We have a job to do, Anakin. Try not to upset him. Your lightsabres will make a fine addition to my collection. Not this time. And this time, you won't escape. R2. Crush them! Make them suffer! Come. Now! Stay at your stations! Get him! Get him! Run! Don't bother with them. - Keep the ship in orbit. - Yes, sir. You lose, General Kenobi. Get out of here! Run! Time to abandon ship. All the escape pods have been launched. Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this? - You mean, can I land what's left of it? - Well? Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in. Open all hatches. Extend all flaps and drag fins. We lost something. Not to worry. We are still flying half a ship. Now we're really picking up speed. Eight plus 60. - We're in the atmosphere. - Grab that. Keep us level. Steady. Easy, R2. Fire ships on the left and the right. - We'll take you in. - Copy that. - Landing strip, straight ahead. - We're coming in too hot. Another happy landing. Coming, Master? No. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy. Hold on. This whole operation was your idea. Let us not forget, Anakin, that you rescued me from the buzz droids. And you killed Count Dooku, and you rescued the chancellor... carrying me unconscious on your back. All because of your training. Anakin, let's be fair. Today you were the hero... and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians. All right. But you owe me one, and not for saving your skin for the 10th time. Ninth time. That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing. Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right? Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again. General Grievous will run and hide, as he always does. He's a coward. But with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the droid army. And I assure you... the senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive. Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority. - Watch it. - Excuse me. - Come along, R2. - The Republic cannot praise you enough. Thank you, Senator Organa. It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that. Now there I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself. But the fighting will continue until General Grievous is spare parts. I will do everything I can in the senate. - Excuse me. - Certainly. I've missed you, Padm. There were whispers that you'd been killed. I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been, if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges. - Wait. Not here. - Yes, here. I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married. Anakin, don't say things like that. Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on? Something wonderful has happened. Ani, I'm pregnant. That's wonderful. What are we gonna do? We're not gonna worry about anything right now. All right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life. Yes, Lord Sidious? General Grievous... I suggest you move the separatist leaders to Mustafar. It will be done, my lord. The end of the war is near, General. But the loss of Count Dooku- His death was a necessary loss. Soon I will have a new apprentice- one far younger and more powerful. Ani, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We can go to the lake country where no one will know... where we can be safe. I can go early and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot. Right by the gardens. You are so... beautiful. It's only because I'm so in love. No, it's because I'm so in love with you. So love has blinded you? That's not exactly what I meant. But it's probably true. Anakin, help me! What's bothering you? Nothing. I remember when I gave this to you. How long is it gonna take for us to be honest with each other? - It was a dream. - Bad? Like the ones I used to have about my mother, just before she died. And? And it was about you. Tell me. It was only a dream. You die in childbirth. And the baby? I don't know. - It was only a dream. - I won't let this one become real. This baby will change our lives. I doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate. If the council discovers you're the father, you'll be expelled- I know. I know. Do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us? We don't need his help. Our baby is a blessing. Premonitions? Premonitions. These visions you have- They're of pain, suffering. Death. Yourself you speak of, or someone you know? Someone. Close to you? Yes. Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side. I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda. Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed that is. What must I do, Master Yoda? Train yourself to let go... of everything you fear to lose. You've missed the report on the outer rim sieges. I'm sorry. I was held up. - I have no excuse. - In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity. What's wrong, then? The senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today. That can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It'll make it easier for us to end this war. Be careful of your friend Palpatine. Be careful of what? - He has requested your presence. - What for? He would not say. He didn't inform the council? That's unusual, isn't it? All of this is unusual. And it's making me feel uneasy. I hope you trust me, Anakin. Of course. I need your help, son. What do you mean? I'm depending on you. For what? I don't understand. To be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic. I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council. Me? A master? I'm overwhelmed, sir. But the council elects its own members. They'll never accept this. I think they will. They need you. More than you know. Allow this appointment lightly the council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine. I understand. You are on this council... but we do not grant you the rank of master. What? How can you do this? This is outrageous. It's unfair. How can you be on the council and not be a master? Take a seat, young Skywalker. Forgive me, Master. We have surveyed all systems in the Republic... but have found no sign of General Grievous. Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is. The outlying systems you must sweep. We do not have many ships to spare. What about the droid attack on the Wookiees? It is critical we send an attack group there immediately. He's right. It's a system we cannot afford to lose. Go I will. Good relations with the Wookiees I have. It's settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all. What kind of nonsense is this? Put me on the council and not make me a master? It's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting. Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honour. To be on the council at your age- it's never happened before. The fact of the matter is you are too close to the chancellor. The council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs. I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the council. But it's what you wanted. Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off. That has nothing to do with this. The only reason the council has approved your appointment... is because the chancellor trusts you. And? Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't want to put you in this situation. What situation? The council wants you to report on all the chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to. They want me to spy on the chancellor? - But that's treason. - We are at war, Anakin. Why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session? This assignment is not to be on record. The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here. That is why you must help us. Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate, not to its leader... who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired. The senate demanded that he stay longer. Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place. You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me? The council is asking you. Anakin did not take to his new assignment with much enthusiasm. It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him. With all due respect, Master, is he not the chosen one? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force? So the prophecy says. A prophecy that misread could have been. He will not let me down. He never has. I hope right you are. Sometimes I wonder what's happening to the Jedi order. I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic. Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? What do you mean? What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists... and the Republic has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy? I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a separatist. This war represents a failure to listen. Now you're closer to the chancellor than anyone. Please, ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume. Don't ask me to do that. Make a motion in the senate, where that kind of a request belongs. - What is it? - Nothing. Don't do this. Don't shut me out. Let me help you. Hold me. Like you did by the lake on Naboo. So long ago, when there was nothing but our love. No politics, no plotting, no war. - You wanted to see me, Chancellor. - Yes, Anakin. Come closer. I have good news. Our clone intelligence units... have discovered the location of General Grievous. He's hiding in the Utapau system. At last. We'll be able to capture that monster and end this war. I would worry about the collective wisdom of the council... if it didn't select you for this assignment. You're the best choice, by far. Sit down. Leave us. You know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will. I'm not sure I understand. You must sense what I have come to suspect. The Jedi Council want control of the Republic. They're planning to betray me. - I don't think that- - Anakin. Search your feelings. You know, don't you? I know they don't trust you. Or the senate. Or the Republic. Or democracy, for that matter. I have to admit, my trust in them has been shaken. Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? They asked you to spy on me, didn't they? I don't know what to say. Remember back to your early teachings. All who gain power are afraid to lose it. - Even the Jedi. - The Jedi use their power for good. Good is a point of view, Anakin. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way... including their quest for greater power. The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inwards- only about themselves. And the Jedi don't? The Jedi are selfless. They only care about others. Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith... Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith... so powerful and so wise... he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians... to create... life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side... he could even keep the ones he cared about... from dying. He could actually... save people from death? The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities... some consider to be unnatural. What happened to him? He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was... Iosing his power. Which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic. He could save others from death... but not himself. Is it possible to learn this power? Not from a Jedi. All Red units, over here! Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau? A partial message was intercepted... in a diplomatic packet from the chairman of Utapau. Act on this we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed. The chancellor has requested... that I lead the campaign. The council will make up its own mind who is to go... not the chancellor. A master is needed, with more experience. I concur. Master Kenobi should go. I agree. Aye. Aye. Very well. Council adjourned. The droids have started up their main power generators. - Then now the time is, Commander. - Yes, sir. Charge! Head for cover! - You're gonna need me on this one. - I agree. However, it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase. Master. I've disappointed you. I haven't been very appreciative of your training. I've been arrogant, and I apologize. I've just been so frustrated with the council. You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be. But be patient, Anakin. It will not be long before the council makes you a Jedi master. Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you. Goodbye, old friend. May the Force be with you. Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here. On the far side. I'll keep them distracted until you get there. -Just don't take too long. - Come on. When have I ever let you down? Very well. The burden is on me not to destroy all the droids until you arrive. Save your energy. I can't. Don't give up, Padm. Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he? He came by this morning. What did he want? He's worried about you. He says you've been under a lot of stress. I feel lost. Lost? What do you mean? Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me. They trust you with their lives. Something's happening. I'm not the Jedi I should be. I want more. And I know I shouldn't. You expect too much of yourself. - I found a way to save you. - Save me? From my nightmares. Is that what's bothering you? I won't lose you, Padm. I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani. - I promise you. - No, I promise you. Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary? Unfortunately, the war. There's no war here- unless you brought it with you. With your kind permission, I should like some fuel... and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous. He is here. We are being held hostage. - They are watching us. - I understand. Tenth level, thousands of battle droids. Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time. Take the fighter back to the ship. Tell Cody I've made contact. - Is he bringing additional warriors? - He didn't say. It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the outer rim. It is a volcanic planet. - You will be safe there. - Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General. Without Count Dooku, I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe. Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip. Your ship is waiting. Hello there. General Kenobi. You are a bold one. Kill him. Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself. Your move. You fool. I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku. Attack, Kenobi. Army or not... you must realize you are doomed. I don't think so. Cover that corner. Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous... and we have begun our attack. Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions. Yes, Master. I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the chancellor. If he does not give up his emergency powers... after the destruction of Grievous... then he should be removed from office. The Jedi Council would have to take control of the senate... in order to secure a peaceful transition. To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Great care we must take. Chancellor. We've just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous. We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge. I should be there with him. It's upsetting to me to see that the council... doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi master? I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that... I'm being excluded from the council. I know there are things about the Force that they're not telling me. They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. You must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force. How do you know the ways of the Force? My mentor taught me everything about the Force. Even the nature of the dark side. You know the dark side? If one is to understand the great mystery... one must study all its aspects... not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader... you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force... and you will be able to save your wife... from certain death. What did you say? Use my knowledge. I beg you. You're the Sith lord. I know what's been troubling you. Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council. Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life... greater than that of an ordinary Jedi. A life of significance... of conscience. - Are you going to kill me? - I would certainly like to. I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus... makes you stronger. I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council. Of course. You should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? I will quickly discover the truth of all this. You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. Power to save Padm. So uncivilized. Master Windu, I must talk to you. Skywalker, we just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We're on our way to make sure... the chancellor returns emergency power back to the senate. He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord. A Sith lord? Yes. The one we've been looking for. - How do you know this? - He knows the ways of the Force. He's been trained to use the dark side. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi order is to survive. Master, the chancellor is very powerful. You'll need my help if you're going to arrest him. For you own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgement. - I must go, Master. - No. If what you've told me is true, you will have gained my trust. But for now, remain here. Wait in the council chambers until we return. Yes, Master. You do know, don't you... if theJedi destroy me... any chance of saving her will be lost. Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say you're here sooner than expected. In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic... you're under arrest, Chancellor. Are you threatening me, Master Jedi? The senate will decide your fate. - I am the senate. - Not yet. It's treason then. You are under arrest, my lord. Anakin, I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over. The oppression of the Sith will never return. You have lost. You will die! He's a traitor! He is the traitor! I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. Don't listen to him, Anakin! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold it any longer. I can't. I'm weak. I'm too weak. Help me. Help me! I can't hold on any longer. I am going to end this once and for all. You can't. He must stand trial. He has control of the senate and the courts. He's too dangerous to be left alive. I'm too weak. - Don't kill me. Please. - It's not the Jedi way. He must live. - Please don't. - I need him. Please don't! Power! Unlimited power! What have I done? You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force. I will do whatever you ask. Good. Just help me save Padm's life. I can't live without her. To cheat death is a power only one has achieved... but if we work together... I know we can discover the secret. I pledge myself... to your teachings. Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth you shall be known as... Darth... Vader. Thank you, my master. Rise. Because the council did not trust you, my young apprentice... I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here... they will kill us, along with all the senators. I agree. The council's next move will be against the senate. Every single Jedi... including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi... is now an enemy of the Republic. I understand, Master. We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless. If they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First I want you to go to the Jedi temple. We will catch them off-balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side... to save Padm. What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy? Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the temple... go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray... and the other separatist leaders. Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy! And... we shall have... peace. Sergeant, over here! Hurry! All of them! All Red units, let's move it! Come on. Let's go! Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels. Very good, sir. By the way, I think you'll be needing this. Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win. Yes, sir. Commander Cody... the time has come. Execute order 66. Yes, my lord. Blast him! Come on! Execute order 66. It will be done, my lord. It will be done, my lord. Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do? The chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple. Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be all right. - What's going on here? - There's been a rebellion, sir. Don't worry. The situation is under control. I'm sorry, sir. It's time for you to leave. And so it is. Get him! Don't worry about him. Let him go. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east. Yes, sir. Goodbye, Tarfful. Goodbye, Chewbacca. Miss you I will. Hopefully we'll be able to intercept a few Jedi... before they walk into this catastrophe. Did you find Kenobi? Sir, no one could have survived that fall. Start loading your men on the ships. Move it. Emergency code 913. I have no contact on any frequency. Master Kenobi. - Repeat. - Master Kenobi. Senator Organa. My clone troops turned on me. I need help. We havejust rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates. Hush! Not so loud. Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi temple. - You could see the smoke from here. - I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe. What's happening? The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic. I can't believe that. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the chancellor myself. What are you gonna do? I will not betray the Republic. My loyalties lie with the chancellor... and with the senate and with you. - What about Obi-Wan? - I don't know. Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the chancellor. Anakin, I'm afraid. Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The chancellor has given me a very important mission. The separatists have gathered on the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return. Things will be different. I promise. Please, wait for me. Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2. Take care, my little friend. Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do? No, thank you, 3PO. I feel so helpless. How many other Jedi have managed to survive? Heard from no one have we. I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda. Have we had any contact from the temple? Received a coded retreat message we have. It requests all Jedi to return to the temple. - It says the war is over. - Then we must go back. If there are any stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed. Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you? Yes, Master. There is too much at stake. I agree. And a little more knowledge might light our way. The plan has gone as you had promised, my lord. You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives... he will take care of you. We're receiving a message from the chancellor's office, sir. - Send it through. - Yes, sir. Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor requests your presence... at a special session of Congress. - I will be there. - He'll be expecting you. - Could be a trap. - I don't think so. The chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems... without keeping the senate intact. If a special session of Congress there is... easier for us to enter the Jedi temple it will be. R2, stay with the ship. Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you. And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. What's happened? The chancellor's been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate. The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. Not even the younglings survived. Killed not by clones this Padawan. By a lightsabre he was. Who? Who could have done this? The attempt on my life... has left me scarred and deformed. But I assure you. My resolve has never been stronger! Stop! In order to ensure the security and continuing stability... the Republic will be reorganized... into the first Galactic Empire! For a safe and secure society. So this is how liberty dies. With thunderous applause. The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace. We only want- I have recalibrated the code, warning all surviving Jedi to stay away. For the clones... to discover the recalibration a long time it will take. Wait. Master. There is something I must know. If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find. I must know the truth, Master. It can't be. It can't be. You have done well, my new apprentice. Now, Lord Vader... go and bring peace to the Empire. I can't watch any more. Destroy the Sith we must. Send me to kill the emperor. I will not kill Anakin. To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough you are not. He is like my brother. I cannot do it. Twisted by the dark side young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is. Consumed by Darth Vader. I do not know where the emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look. Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him you will. When was the last time you saw him? - Yesterday. - And do you know where he is now? Padm, I need your help. - He is in grave danger. - From the Sith? From himself. Anakin has turned to the dark side. You're wrong. How could you even say that? I have seen a security hologram... of him... killing younglings. Not Anakin. He couldn't. He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice. I don't believe you. I can't. I must find him. You're going to kill him, aren't you? He has become a very great threat. I can't. Anakin is the father, isn't he? I'm so sorry. - Milady, let me come with you. - There's no danger. The fighting's over. And this is personal. As you wish, milady, but I strongly disagree. I'll be all right, Captain. This is something I must do myself. Besides, 3PO will look after me. Oh, dear. Do you know? I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business. The separatists have been taken care of, my master. It is finished then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. All droid units must shut down immediately. Very good, my lord. I saw your ship. - What are you doing out here? - I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things. What things? He said you've turned to the dark side. That you... killed younglings. Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me. He cares about us. Us? He knows. He wants to help you. Anakin, all I want is your love. Love won't save you, Padm. - Only my new powers can do that. - At what cost? You're a good person. Don't do this. I won't lose you the way I lost my mother. I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of. And I'm doing it for you. To protect you. Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can. Don't you see? We don't have to run away any more. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the chancellor. I can overthrow him. And together, you and I can rule the galaxy... make things the way we want them to be. I don't believe what I'm hearing. Obi-Wan was right. You've changed. I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me. I don't know you any more. You're breaking my heart. You're going down a path I can't follow. Because of Obi-Wan? Because of what you've done. What you plan to do. Stop. Stop now. Come back. - I love you. - Liar! You're with him! You brought him here to kill me. Let her go, Anakin. Let her go. You turned her against me! You have done that yourself. You will not take her from me! Your anger and your lust for power have already done that. You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind... until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy. Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace... freedom, justice and security to my new empire. Your new empire? Don't make me kill you. Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy! If you're not with me... then you're my enemy. Only a Sith deals in absolutes. I will do what I must. You will try. I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor. Or should I call you Darth Sidious? Master Yoda. You survived. Surprised? Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience... the full power of the dark side. I have waited a long time for this moment... my little green friend. At last the Jedi are no more. Not if anything to say about it I have. At an end your rule is. And not short enough it was. If so powerful you are... why leave? You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us. Faith in your new apprentice misplaced may be. As is your faith in the dark side of the Force. Hurry. Careful timing we will need. Activate your homing beacon when you're ready. There's no sign of his body, sir. - Then he is not dead. - Double your search. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate take-off. - Yes, Master. - I sense Lord Vader is in danger. Into exile I must go. Failed I have. I have failed you, Anakin. I have failed you. I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over. Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil. Then you are lost! This is the end for you, my master. It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground. You underestimate my power. Don't try it. You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness! I hate you! You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you. Master Kenobi. We have Miss Padm on board. Yes. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place. Is Anakin all right? Your Majesty, this way. There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule immediately. Yes, sir. Right away. Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact. We'll take her to the medical centre. Quickly. Medically, she's completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her. - She's dying? - We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies. Babies? She's carrying twins. Luke. Oh, Luke. - It's a girl. - Leia. There's good in him. I know. I know there's... still- Lord Vader. Can you hear me? Yes, Master. Where is Padm? Is she safe? Is she all right? It seems, in your anger, you killed her. I? I couldn't have. She was alive. I felt it! Hidden, safe the children must be kept. We must take them somewhere where the Sith will not sense their presence. Split up they should be. My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us. And what of the boy? To Tatooine. To his family send him. I will take the child and watch over him. Until the time is right, disappear we will. Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you. Training? An old friend has learned the path to immortality. One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force. Your old master. Qui-Gon? How to commune with him I will teach you. - Captain Antilles. - Yes, Your Highness? I'm placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the protocol droid's mind wiped. What?, - Hi! I'm Lenny. - Hi. Little body, did I scare you? I'm sorry. Wake up. Wake up. Okay, don't worry about it, I'm gonna get you out in a jiffy. You just keep holding your breath, little wormy. - Yo Lenny! - I'm coming, Franki! Move it, come on! Pap's waiting. Here we go. Got you! Okay, body you're free. Now escape, go! Just go, cry freedom. - You almost gave me a heart attack! - Lenny, what are you doing? What? I was just... picking you some flowers! Hey, mom said it's not okay to hit me! Mom's not here. Don't. Don't! What do you mean? It's a theme song. Are they gone? Are they gone? You're sure?

This is a perfect example why you're in management and I'm not. You go boy. Look, I have to start paying Don Lino for protection, so everything you owe me, you owe him! - How did you figured that?

I'm gonna give you twenty-four hours to pay out. All of it? - How will I do that? - That's your problem. Bring my five thousand clams tomorrow, or else... - Or else what? The boys will explain you. Unpleasant! Five thousand clams?! You borrowed five thousand clams from mister Sykes? Oscar, why do you get yourself into these situations? I don't know, Ange, it's just hard, allright? Because I'm a little fish in a big pot. A really big pot. The ocean. I'm nobody. - I want some of that! - Missis Sanches? Uh, no. That. The top of the reef. Where the somebodies live. I wanna be rich and famous like them! - But I'm stuck down here. - Well, what's wrong with down here? I'll tell you what's wrong with down here. Remember my dad? He worked at the washes the whole life. He was the number one tongue scrubber. Every year for twenty-five years. To me working at the wash was the coolest job in the ocean. But then I've learned something I would never forget. Ha, ha! Oscar dad's the tongue scruber! Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber! My dad was the greatest. But nobody loves nobody. - I wanna be a somebody! - Oscar, you don't have to live at the top of the reef to be a somebody. What's the difference, if I don't pay mister Sykes' beg by tomorrow. I'm dead anyway. Wait here. What's this? - A pink pearl? - Hm. - Where did you get that? - My grandmother gave it to me. She said it started from a tiny grand of sand, but then after a while, it grew in something beautiful. - Dreams can begin small too. - No, I couldn't. Take it! It'll get you the money you need for mister Sykes. What's new on the stand? I'd been on all over this a thousand times, I don't wanna to say it again. You know, you've really given me actually, you know that? I don't know how else to say this to you, Lenny. You see something, you kill it and you eat it. Period. Thanks. That's what sharks do! That's a fine tradition. What's the matter with you? Your brother Franki here, he's a killer. - Right, pap. - He's beautiful, he does what he's supposed to do! Wipe your face. But you... I'm hearing things... You gotta understand, when you look week, it make me look week. - I know, pap. - I'm sorry. - Lenny, Lenny, look at me. Look at me! This ain't nobody's business, this is for you! It's for both of you! And you're acting like you don't even want it! I need to know that you can handle that. Right here in front of me now, eat this. Yeah, oh Jee! Thanks pap. Here's the thing. I'm on a diet, and I've read an article about these shrimps, they are not good for you, you know how many calories are in one shrimp? - A lot! - It's true! It's true, and the other thing is, my sister had a baby and I took her baby, cause she past away, and then the baby lost it's legs, and it's all I wasn't suppose I gonna stop, but I still take care of him with my wife. It's crawling and it's fearly happy, it's difficult, cause I've been working on a second shift at the factory, there put food on the table, all the love and I see that little guy's tears, it's the worst in the world. Front story. I'm not asking you anymore, I'm telling you, eat it! - No! Have mercy! - Pap, please! - Eat! - Don't eat! - What are you... - Son, eat... - No! the shrimp! - Please! - No, please, no! - Lenny! Eat! Eat, eat, eat! - Eat, eat, eat, eat! - Put the shrimp down! All right, go now. No one's looking. Get out of here! - You're free. Go on, go, go! - Thank you. You're good person. Come on, fellows! - Papa, why can't I handle the reef? - No! No! We're gonna do this as a family. Franki, I want you to take Lenny out, and show him the rules. - Oh come on, pap. - Son you're gonna learn how to be a shark! Will you like it or not. - That kid better show up, or he's dead meat! - Yes, at a word, boss. Get a whole load of the money, give it to mister Sykes. Come on, hurry up, hurry up! - This is our chance, you don't wanna miss it! - Are you sure about this? A friend of friend of mine tipped me off! - Race is rigged. We can't lose! - Well what's the horses name? Lucky day. LUCKY DAY SEABISCUIT - We're gonna be rich. Rich! - Top of the reef, here I come! No, wait! What am I doing? Remember what Angie said, remember what Angie said. What did Angie say? Dreams can begin small, you just have to bet it all! Bet it all! Five thousand on Lucky day to win! That's two hundred a one! - That would pay a million clams! - Than I guess it makes me, Oscar la millionaire. Lucky day! Lucky day! Lucky day! Nice bet. You have a name? You wanna tell me what it is? Well mine's Lola. Come on man! Get it handled yourself! So... Lola, my name's O... My name is Oscar, sweety. - Missis Sanches! - I hate when it hops, smooth dog, don't work with me! - No, my bad. Hey! So... - Oscar! I was starting to think you skipped on on me. Sykes! Hey! I see you... already to your way to the cashier stand. - What are doing? - You mind bring us back some drinks? - Why are you touching me? - That'll be great man, thanks. Oh I know, I'll bring back some of little winner thing! - You mean the one with the toothpicks? - What are doing? Don't listen to him! - Come on Lola, let me escort you to... my box. - Your box? His box? You can't even afford the gum to the seats! He just laid five grand on Lucky day, I think he can afford anything he wants! Five grand? My five grand? - No, it was another five grand. - You had the money to pay me back and you bet it anyway? - Hold on. - Give me that! - Sykes! - Clearly I've made a mistake. - No! No, wait! Lola! Look, deep down, I'm really superficial. And don't get me wrong, you're cute, but you are a nobody. Oscar, you're cute, but you are a nobody. Wait Lola! Come back! I'm not a nobody! I'm a winner! You are unbelievable, you're in trouble up to your gilles, and still, you're asking for more? Now go on, get in here! Oscar, you better pray that this horse of yours comes through. You bet my five thousand! Hey! Hey! Hey! Out of my seat! You, out of my seat! Unbelievable! Unbelievable! - Sit tight and watch the race. - With your good eye! Horses are ready on the post. Race is going special by Seabiscuit and some of other! The long shoulder Lucky day appears of having trouble of getting out of the gates. - What? Only a sucker could have bet on him! No, no, no, don't sweat it man, he does this all the time, he just blam. - Oh, what's this? Lucky day has crossed his way through the gates! And he's off for running! That was straight away Seabiscuit forcing on Lucky day! Fast! Go fast! Coming round the fall tone the Seabiscuit riding, and Lucky day well behind the pack. And in comes Lucky day! Coming up from behind! He's passing other tales! Now or never! Sykes, you see? Who's your fish now? Around the final turn here comes Lucky day! Lucky day is now calling the Fishfingers! He gets ahead. Wait, I'm getting tired, just beg him up! Look how Lucky day goes! Absolutely amazing! This is Lucky day's big day! That's Lucky day! What happened! Lucky day is down! No!!! And here comes Fishfingers followed by Seabiscuit yellow tail. Fishfingers wins! - What is it? - Wait, wait, wait I just wanted to hold you! Get out of my way, let me see! Poor sad day for Lucky day! And that's why they call him the low shot. Yo, that was crazy, right? Who knew? I mean everything's set, there's a luck, we're good to go, we're in the money, and he trips underwater. Who in a hell trips underwater? And by the way... That's it! That's it, I've had it. Ernie, Bernie, I want you to find the deepest, darkest hole in the ocean, and when you do, dig deeper, and put him in it! Sorry kid, it's nothing personal. It's just business. Don't worry about a day, cause every little thing is gonna be all right! - This is how you sing it, Oscar. - Yeah. Sykes, you like your money. I set ticket easy on you. - But Sykes is not here! - True. - Ernie, let me ask you a question. - Yeah man, go on. Why is it that millacscan sting on a people? But they have no affect on you. Ernie, I didn't mean it Ernie! I didn't mean it man! Ernie! You made a joke! - Good one man! Respect! - Respect. Load fire! - Franki, you know I can't do this! - Lenny, if you wanna make pap happy, you gotta kill something! - Or I could find a very old sick fish and just wait! - Oh. This getting around, you think of the day in the restaurant, you know how fish pop! Bit of bit, bit of bob, this that the other, then how you're doing? Boom! Get a body here.

Any event, that possibly, you know, you're hungry... Don't worry, I'm not gonna eat anyone. In case you haven't noticed, I'm different from the other sharks. Let's put it that way, leave it at that. Good night! - Define different. - You'll laugh. - I'm not gonna laugh! - Well that's just what you said, and then what happens later? You laugh. Lenny, I give you my word. Okay, I will tell you, I'm... I'm a vegetarian. Hm, hold on. So that's it? - What do you mean that's it? - I'm just... You're first fish I've ever told! I'm so tired of keeping that all a secret! - And my dad, - Wow, hey! he'll never accept me for who I am. - What's wrong with me? - Nothing is wrong with you, man. - I think all sharks should be like you. - God, that sweet to say. And stop blaming yourself for what happened. - Really? - If you wanna blame anybody, blame me. Cause if I hadn't been out there, in the first place, nothing of this would happen! Yeah, if pop knew that, he'd ice you for sure. Ice? Was that a godfather or something? - Yeah. - What do you mean, 'yeah'? Yeah, he is. Hey, are you all right? GAME OVER - Ha, man, I told you! - I'm doing this! Left circle double left square right to the down square square. Another square! Respect. - Respect. Oh yeah? Well I got some news for you! The Sharkslayer made me his manager, so I'm now... what I like to call untouchable! Did you hear me? - Sykes! - Okay. Hey Oscar! - Sykes! - Hey hey hey, there he is, my brother, my player, the Sharkslayer! - Yeah whatever, Sykes listen. And another thing, from now on you're gonna have to start paying me for protection! Sykes, the deal is off, the shark I killed was Don Lino's son! - I know! Any grade? - Not if he finds out! What do you mean find out? I've got him on the phone right now! That's right, Lino. I've got the Sharkslayer right here in front of me! - And he's gonna slay you and all of your sharks! - Sykes, shut up! Shut up! Hey that's good. That's good, I like that. Shut up, Lino! Shut up! - What? Oh, kid, he wants to talk to you. - I know, I'm not here! I'm not here! Yeah, he's right here. - Hello. - Shut up? Shut up? You don't tell me shut up, I tell you shut up! - What? Hello? - Yeah, how you're doing? Let me have a pie with everything on it. Anchovies, meet balls, mushrooms... - Luca! - Oh, hi boss! - What are you doing working in a pizza joint? - Get off the phone! But I'm hungry! My guys are coming for you, Sharkslayer! They are going to tear you fin from fin! Come on, now who's your puff daddy? Who takes care of you? Come on you two, we've got work to do. - I was winning! - Sykes, Sykes, hold, look! - You got it all wrong! - I've been writing songs about you kid! - All the shark bites.. - Sykes. With his teeth dear. - And then Oscar, - Sykes! - Kicked his butt! - Sykes, Sykes, man! - Come on! - Maybe I can help? Hey! Lola! What are you doing here? You pop it up sometimes in places! Oh you said to wait, so... - I've been waiting. - Look, I don't have a lot of time for a whole hand clappy making the life's go on music playing and the guitar thing, you know. - What are you afraid of? - Afraid? That's funny. I'm not afraid of nothing, it's just... - Oh baby, you're so tense. - Yeah, you know. I've really been stressed lately, like protecting the reef, you know, I do that for myself. - It's just too crazy. - It's just too much. Yeah, you know, just one thing on top of the other. Actually I was thinking about retiring. - You don't wanna do that. - I don't? You have worked your way to the top. You don't wanna go back to the bottom, do you? - No. No, no way! - You just show them who's boss. And the sharks will leave you alone. Yeah, you're right! Lenny! - Pss! Lenny! Where are you? - Hello, Oscar. Angie! Hey! What are you doing here? What Oscar, did you forget something? Oh maybe, you forgot your shark! Hi. Shark! Swim Angie! I'll cover you! Quick! - Before it's too late! Go home without me! - Oh stop it! Your friend shark here told me everything. - Lenny, why would you do that? - I don't know, I like her! Thank you, I like you too. What were you thinking bringing him in here? - No, I just, I'm still working at the cakes. - Cakes? You lie! - Everybody thinks you're slayer of the sharks! - Who am I gonna tell that they are wrong? - How could you lie to me, Oscar? Me? - Don't take it personally. Come on, I lied to everybody! All right. Look, I'm sorry. I totally betrayed you, but listen I got just one... little problem I gotta take care of. - Of what's that? - Sharks are coming to get me! - And they should! I mean, what did you expect? You just take credit for killing the shark and everything will be fine and dandy for the rest of your life? Yeah! But don't you worry about it. Me and Lenny got it, we go fix it! - Wow, wow, wow. - What's with the 'we', I don't wanna 'we' part of this. - Hey, too late now, vagie boy, they'll be looking for you too. - Point taken. What's the plan? - Allright, just what we will do. Oscar! Here's the plan! You tell the truth. And you go home! Allright, look. This we're gonna do, right? We will paint you up all bloody. Just mess, right? And you go swim out and meet the sharks before they get here. And you will say stop! Don't go no further! This Sharkslayer's crazy man! He beat me senceless! He's stone cold killer, man! And then you can tell them I'm huge! You know, tell them that I'm handsome. - You're going way too far, Oscar! - Acually he hasn't gone far enough. Exactly! What? You need slay a shark, and I need to dissappear. This is what we're gonna do. This is Katie Current, reporting live. We've got uncontrolled reports of... Shark!!! Look, it's the Sharkslayer! Holy microbe! Did we get that? Hey, Ange! Oscar's on the TV! Show me that. Allright, do what you do best. Do you hear them, Lenny? They are going crazy, man! - They love us! - They love you, they hate me! - What? - Let's switch sides, maybe I can be the Fishslayer! - They'll never see it coming! - Come on, man! You saw this, you'll never have to go home again! You can start a new life! - Now give me a growl! - Okay. - Like that? - That was pretty good. Let's go! Is that what you're offering? Do you understand how huge my client is? Turn on your TV right now! Lenny, hold on! Lenny, Lenny! Turn off your TV! Turn off your TV! - Don't swallow! - Oscar? No, it's Pinnoccio. Of course it's me! Why did you do that? - I'm sorry. - No, no. Sorry, is when you step on somebody's fin at the movie theater. It is sorry. Sorry, is what you say, Hey, where's the baby, dude? And it turns out to burst is just fat! This is as far away from sorry, as you could possibly get! - But Oscar! I think I'm gonna puke. - No, no, no! Lenny, just open up. Nice and easy. - Are you not entertained? - Go Oscar, man! - You can't handle its rule! - Go get them! You had me at hello! Turn your TV back on! What are you doing, turning your TV off? Turn it on! This reef is huge. How we're supposed to find the Sharkslayer? This is it, Lenny. Big finish! Just like we practised. - The flying fish? - The flying fish! Little more help here, body boy! - Sorry. - Thank you. Curse you, Sharkslayer! Yeah, and you tell Don Lino, that I don't never ever ever ever never! Want to see another shark on this reef again! - Ever! Remember this name, Oscar the Sharkslayer! Aha! You see? You see? Ha? Look at Oscar! Oscar! Hey, Lol... It seems that Sharkslayer not only countered a few sharks today, but maybe a few hearts? Has the reef's most eligible bachelor have been snapped up? I'm Katie Current. You're live watching the Sharkslayer making out. Hey Angie, can you hand me the blue one? Thank you. Who steps in the room? - Yeah! - Oscar and Lenny! What a dream baby! Give me that! Give me some fin! - High fin! - Give me some fin! - Low fin! - Did you see me? I was like... - That was great! - When you punched me, the crowd was... Yeah, the ate it up! Hey Angie, Angie you ain't know how Lenny had me in him, did you? - It was like an Oscar explosion! - How good was I? - Oh you was the ball! - Thank you, thank you. Hey, hey, hey! Casanova! I saw your big finish on the news. Nice smooch, lover boy. It was just private, just private. - Private! The entire reef saw you do it. - Hey, somebody's got a bad move. Come on, Ange. Let me see the smile! - Show me the smile, baby! - Knock it off! - What is gotten in you? - Me? I want, I swear! Sometimes I wanna take your big dumb dummy head and just... - Ange, Ange, what is the problem? - Problem? There's no problem, I'm not having problem! Maybe it's probably because you're the one with a problem! - Hey you guys? - What have you got against Lola? Not my lips, that's for sure! - Okay, what's going on? - I'm gonna stay out of this. Look, why would you even care about Lola anyway? - I don't! - You don't? - No! - No what? - I don't know! - You guys, you wanna get? - No - No! Just tell me, Oscar, cause I'm curious. Why do you think she's interested? Do you think for one minute that she would even be with you, if you want to reach a fame of Sharkslayer? - Come on guys, please don't fight. - Are you that light? - At least she treats me like I'm somebody! - Yeah, but will she love you if you were nobody? - Nobody loved me when I was nobody! - I did! Before the money, and before the fame, before the lie! To me you were a somebody, Oscar. Now you're nothing! But a fake. A shame. - You're joker. - Here I come! Sebastian, the way you'll washing dolphin! - Angie. - No, forget it! Just go! Cause I'm tired of hearing that everything you had in your life wasn't good enough. Including me. - Angie? - Oh honey, I'm sorry. Go back and do it again. Hey, come on. It'll be okay. You can't have the lose! You got shark breath! 'O' mints 'Coca cola' 'Get real' What are you kids doing? How many times I got to tell you? This is past your bed time! Go on, all right. Hey, hey, hey! What are you kids are... Well, it looks pretty good! You guys should do this for a living! Preparation 'O'! It slays hemorroids like Oscar slays sharks! Hey Oscar! Angie was right. I am a joker. Hey, Sharkslayer. Why are you in here? - All your friens are inside! - Not all my friends. You may not little bottom feeder from the whale wash. Forget about her. She's a nobody. I'm the nobody. Oh let me guess. She told you that she loves you, is that it? It's not like you feel the same way about her. You know what? I don't think this is gonna work out. What? Are you dumping me? Let me explain something to you. We get party like at your birthday. Ha! Young love! CHOCOLATES FLOWERS - Hey Oscar! - Hey, I can't talk, I gotta find Angie! I need to tell her... I love her! Where you're going, Oscar? - Hi, whale wash. - Give me the phone! - We'll you got a whale to wash and the price... - Give me back the phone! And the price is... very very low. Consider no good washers! - Good one, Ernie. How many times do I have to tell you? It's gosh! You get a whale of a wash, and the price - oh my gosh! - All right, we get it man. - Whale wash, rhymes with gush! - Give me that! Get out of here, both of you. Won't you use some place else, will you? - Sykes? Where's Angie? - You tell me! Whale wash, you got a whale of a wash... No? - It's for you. - Ha? - Hello? - Is this the Sharkslayer? - Yeah, who is this? - It's Luca the octop... I mean, forget about it. Now you follow these instructions, okay? Fall cabinet, top drawer, there's a package. Get it. That's right, tough guy, we got your girl. That is gonna be a sit-down. In one hour. - Who is it? - Shh! Be there if you don't want to see her sleeping with the fishes. The bad ones. Now nod your head if you understand. Now tell me if you nodded your head. I nodded. They got Angie. And they want a sit-down. I never meant for anybody to get hurt, especially not Angie. This is all my fault. That's a classic move. I've seen it a thousand times. They take the thing you love the most, and then they use it against you! Look, we gotta go to that sit-down, and we gotta save her. Wow, wow, wow. Look, I wanna save Angie too, but I can't just sit there and say, - Hi pap, I'm a dolphin! - Lenny? And my friend Sharkslayer, he is a fake! - Fake? - Come on! We're gonna need a better plan than that. This is a joke, right? This is a joke? Because you know, I told Lino, Shut up, Lino! Shut up! Tell me you didn't make it a low kid. Tell me that's not Lenny. Tell me you're a real Sharkslayer. - Please! - I'm sorry, Sykes. I'm not. But the sharks don't know that. Would you stop screwing around? This will never work. We're dead, we're dead! Sh! Thank you, Sykes. Thank you! My man Sykes has just begged me not to murder you all up here, right? Now I might listen to him. But then I cannot might not. And that depends on the individual behaviour of all the individuals in here. Individuals. Hey, is that right? - Look, he's got dolphine muscle. - My uncle Will got wacked by one of those. All right. Which one of you sorry deans caled this meeting? That would be me. So, this the Sharkslayer? I've been looking forward to meet you. I feel like we're practically family! You know that's funny, ain't it? I brought my kids into the world. Full love and care. And you took them out. You know who I am? Do you know who I am? I'm the Don! The boss of the Great White sharks! Hey boss, I saved your seat. I've been running this reef since before you was born! And If you thought that guy like me, can't get to a guy like you, guess what? You thought wrong! Man, you're the one who's wrong. I barely know that girl. - What her name was? - Oh yeah? Well I say he's bluffing. - If I wasn't marry. - How you're doing, pretty lady? - Lola! We meet again! - You know, Sharkslayer, there's only one thing I like better than money... Revenge! - Oh, I'm in love! - Your shark slaying days are over! and there ain't nothing you can do about it. Ha? What's so funny? You got nothing! Nothing! Sebastian, take a roll! Can't touch this! Can't touch this! Stop! Oscar time! Okay! New rules! Nobody! I repeat, nobody makes a move without my okay. I am the pattern marker now baby! From now on everything flows through me! What did he do? What did he do? I can't see it! You don't lose a two, you don't grow one back without my okay. - Okay? - Okay. If you sneeze, you don't white dead boogie without my okay. - Okay? - Okay. All right. And you don't say okay, without my okay. Okay? Okay! Thank you all for coming, good meeting, we gotta go. And one more thing. What is with all your living in a low boo? - Oscar! - That was supposed to be my get yourselves a real high-down! - Oscar. And take the good look, Lino. It's over! - Your old school! - Oscar! What? Excuse me. - Ange, are you okay? - No! I am not okay! - He ate me! - I had to take it. - The taste was killing me! - Lenny? Is that you? You're alive? I thought I lost you! What are you wearing, ha? What is that? Hey boss, it's Lenny! He was wearing the disguise, so we wouldn't recognize him. But now he's not wearing a disguise, so we do recognize him! - Hi pap. - Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Are you out of your mind? Do you have any idea how this looks? This is the best sit-down, I've ever been to! What are you doing with disguise? You took out your own flash and blood! - Franki! - Look pap, just listen! It's not that, you never take side against the family, ever! Hey Don Lino! Sir, listen! It's not his fault! - This is between you and me. - What did I ever do to you! You took Franki away, and you've turned Lenny into a dolphin! I'm gonna get you! - Oscar! Look out! - Oscar! Swim! Swim for your life! You're gonna regret the day you became the Sharkslayer! - Look who's talking in the pot hole! - Ha? You're still hungry big guy! Well say hello to my little friends! - Try again. - Whale wash. You get a whale of a wash and a price. Oh my gosh! All right, you got it right! - You got it right. - Move! Everybody everyway! Come on, Lino. It's time to clean up your act. Pap, leave him alone! All right Lino! Game's over! Lenny? What are you doing in there? - Sorry. - Where's Lino? - He's right behind me, isn't he? - You're mine now! - Let's finish the Sharkslayer. - Oh we're about to! Thank you for coming to whale wash. Okay! Somebody needs to get me out of the bubble. Today! - Angie? - The Sharkslayer has done it again! - Hey! - This time... - Wait! - glorying two sharks into his death trap of high gene. - No! Oscar, you're the somebody, everybody wants to be! The top of the food chain! Tell our cameras, how it feels to be you. - Angie? - Oscar, get me out of here, quick! I need to get straight so I get as far away as I supposed to. - Look what you did to him! - No, it's all a big misunderstanding! Sharkslayer, over here! One word about you, Sharkslayer. - Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer! - Stop! I am not a real Sharkslayer! - I lied. - What? And I'm not a real financial advisor! Okay, it was an anchor that killed Franki. I didn't have anything to do with it and neither did Lenny. If that was true, why did you ran away? I think you always wanted me to be like Franki. I'll never be the shark you want me to be. What is your problem? So, your son likes calp? So? His best friends are fishes. So? He likes to dress like a dolphin, so what?! Everybody loves him just the way he is. Why can't you? Don't make the same mistake that I did. I didn't know what I have. Till I lost her. Will you get me out of this? So I can hug my kid. - And tell him I'm sorry. - Pap! Give me a hue. I love you son, no matter what you eat, or how you dress. - Oscar? - Angie? Angie... I wish I knew now what I knew then. I mean... I wish you knew, what I knew. I mean... - Before this. - You're blowing it, man! Mind your business, all right? I'm just emotional, and there's pressure! What I'm saying, I just... I didn't mean the top of the reef. Everything I wanted was right there in front of me. The whole time. What about being a somebody? I'm nobody without you. You're not helping. Oh, come here! You big dumb dummy head! I've never told you till this, but you're the best henchmen and guides I ever had. Come on, group hug! - Ah! Hey! - Sorry man, sorry. Come such, straight again man, don't be afraid. Oh forget, the moment's gone. So Lino, Don, we're cool, right? I mean like the reef is safe, you know walk the streets, you know without... you know? Yeah, we're cool. Oscar, excuse me, Oscar? You've lost everything you've lied so hard to achieve. Tell me, what's next for you? Come on! Everyone's waiting! - Mister manager! - Hey, I just gotta put the finishing touch on my new desk. I love you, pap. - Yo, dog! - Sykes! All right partner, let's see what you can do. Sykes and Oscar's whale wash is now opened for business! Yo E, B, let's get this party boomed! The other wheels of steel! Yo Christina! Missy! How about we have a low? Oscar leashes furnal! What's up with your bow? Let it go! Hey Angie? Sorry papa and I are late, but we brought some new customers! - Hey, how you're doing? - Wow! Okay, guys! Come on in! - Yo, yo, what's up brother? - Hey Oscar! What's up! No, no snap it, snap it, you're not snapping! - I'm snapping, I'm snapping! - It's okay, yo Great Whites can't do it yo! - Yo! - Yo, what's up? - What's up with what? - Yo, yo, yo. Hey, you say yo one more time, and I'm gonna yo you! I'm sorry. - Okay dude, I painted you high! - All right! - Paint me out! - Hey! You think you're smart? What am I? A clown? Keep going with me, don't let me lose you! Cause I can't lose you! In your face! - Allright, what you got? - You don't wanna mess with me! Yo-hoo! Break it down, fellows!, Well, Dmitri, every search for a hero... must begin with something that every hero requires-- a villain. Therefore, in the search for our hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster, Chimera. I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney... and accompany me to Atlanta immediately. However we travel, I must arrive at my destination... within 20 hours of departure. Folks, we're two-and-a-half hours from Atlanta. Look out your window now. We have a great view of the Rocky Mountains. You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor. Oh, yes. I suppose I'm a bit anxious. You'll soon be with old friends. I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri. I'm sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances. I'm sorry too. You are sorry, and I am sorry. You don't know Gradski thought the world of you. Did he... know... before the end that you two had succeeded? Yes, he knew. Just-- Not in time to save him. No. After you've been infected with Chimera for 20 hours, nothing can save you. Not even Bellerophon. You can carry them together... safely? Yes. And you'll get us to safe place with them in Atlanta, thank God. This is your captain again. We've experienced a slight... but abrupt drop in cabin pressure. As a precaution, I've released the oxygen masks. Please put them on and sit back, relax. There's nothing to worry about. Are you concerned? Not so far. Just put on your oxygen mask. I'll see what's going on. Okay. Denver Center, this is Trans-Pac 2207, 747 heavy. We're unable to maintain cabin pressurization. We've initiated a descent to one six thousand. Captain-- It seems we have a problem, Dmitri. You keep calling me Dmitri. You really shouldn't. You are not Dmitri? No. Wallis, hold on to this. Ulrich, remember to pull the-- Remember to pull the NO2 tank and dump it. All done, chief. Terrain. Terrain. Pull up. Pull up. Terrain. Okay, dive, dive! Checkpoint Charlie in three, two, one, go! Terrain. Terrain. Pull up. Pull up. Terrain. Terrain. Pull up. Pull up. - Terrain. Terrain. Pull up. Pull up. Good morning, Mr. Hunt. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves the recovery of a stolen item designated ''Chimera. '' You may select any two team members, but it is essential that the third team member be Nyah Nordoff-Hall. She is a civilian and a highly capable professional thief. You have 48 hours to recruit Miss Nordoff-Hall... and meet me in Seville to receive your assignment. As always, should you or any member of your IMF team be caught or killed, the secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions. And, Mr. Hunt, the next time you go on holiday, please be good enough to let us know where you're going. This message will self-destruct in five seconds. If I let you know where I'm going... then I won't be on holiday. I see you found it. What are you doing here? Think you're the only one who can pick a lock? Huh. You're not just a pretty face after all. Do you mind if I'm on top? No. Either way works for me. - You'll never find it there. - Damn it! Find what? His ex's Bulgari necklace that goes up for auction on Tuesday. And are you gonna tell me where it is? Far left. This is very disconcerting. Hey, you put me here. I just do as I'm told. Right. Hmm! Now, who are you, and what's it gonna cost me? - I wouldn't do that. - What? That. No, no, no. Tranquilo. Tranquilo. Mr. Keys, it is you. It is Mr. Keys, our security engineer. Apologize! No, no. No need to apologize. Now, Miss Hall, my associate has your necklace in a very safe place. But obviously we do feel the alarm should have gone off a little sooner. - Isn't that right, Miss Hall? - Hmm? Oh, absolutely. Much, much too long, I'd say. Under the circumstances, I think we'd recommend... resetting the sensors to respond to a lighter load. How do you feel about 40 kilos, Miss Hall? Perfect. Shall we? - Miss Hall. - Hmm? Haven't you forgotten something? What are you trying to do, seorita? Rob me? The thought had crossed my mind. I'm missing something here, aside from my half-million-pound necklace. Even after I screwed up the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing. At least you walked. Why did you watch me go through it all? I wanted to see how good you were. I was hoping we might work together. Sounds terrific. Muchacho. Now be serious. Whatever you're talking about, you couldn't possibly want me after tonight's performance. - You didn't do that badly. - You apologizing for me? Quite the gentleman. Gracias. Not really. I triggered the alarm. Sorry. I don't do laundry, cook, or put up with cheeky bastards who set me up on their territory so they can poach on mine. Hola. Hi. Would you mind slowing down? Where did you get this number? I don't even have it. Would you like it? Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen. - Listen to what? - I need your help. - And I think you could use mine. - Your help? - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority. - I can make them all go away. - Oh, bloody hell. You're a spy! Well, if you want me, you've gotta catch me! Whoa! You having fun? Sorry. Idiota. Sorry. Watch the road. Watch the road. What's your name? Ethan Hunt. Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about? A lot more than I thought. Awfully short notice. Care to wait a decent interval? Who wants to be decent? So what have you got against spies? When they've got your recruiting technique? This wasn't exactly by the book. They've got a book for this? Oh, they've got a book for everything. So, this thing these blokes pinched-- I don't know that they pinched it. I don't even know that they're blokes. What am I doing here? And I thought I'm supposed to be... some kind of thief to catch a thief. So do I... sort of. Damn, you're beautiful. Espresso? Cappuccino? - No, thanks. - Sit down. Sit down. Festival's a pain in the ass. Honoring their saints by setting them on fire. Lets you know what they think of saints, doesn't it? Damn near set me on fire on my way over here. Sorry I barged in on your vacation. I'm sorry I didn't let you know where I was. Don't be. It wouldn't be a vacation if you did. You're sorry, and I'm sorry. Why did you phrase it like that? - Like what? - ''You're sorry; I'm sorry.'' You've gotta be kidding. Well, Dmitri, once again I need your help. Just as in the old days, huh? When you saved our lives, saved our very sanity. Dmitri... we have this little problem. Every search for a hero... must begin with something that every hero requires-- a villain. Therefore, in the search for our hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster, Chimera. I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney and accompany me to Atlanta immediately. However we travel, I must arrive at my destination... within 20 hours of departure. I fear I can entrust this to no one but you. Dmitri, as we say, I'm sorry and you're sorry. Do you have any idea what the hell he's talking about? - An idea? Yeah. - Like? Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry... and a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier. -Is he still in Sydney? -Dr. Vladimir Nekhovich is dead. So is his colleague Gradski, but that happened earlier. We had Nekhovich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies. - Dead? - Are you listening to me? If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on that flight? Oh, you were there. When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you. Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. Now, he doubled you, what, two or three times? - Twice. - What did you think of him? We had our reservations about each other. Isn't it a little late to be asking me that? No, not necessarily. Airline records... list a Captain Harold Macintosh as the pilot of flight 2207. As far as the media and all government agencies are concerned, Captain Macintosh died on the flight. But, in fact, he missed it. He did, however, make the next flight... in cargo. Stuffed into a rather small suitcase, considering his size. Now, someone on that flight planned an operation... designed to bring the plane down and make it look like an accident. Someone skillful enough to bring the whole thing off without a hitch. So there's one thing we know that Ambrose doesn't. You do think it was Ambrose? You're not surprised? Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground. The question is why? What was this, uh, Chimera, Nekhovich was carrying? Only Ambrose knows that. In any case, you must recover this-- whatever-- Chimera, and bring it to us. In order to do that, I have to figure out how he plans to make money with it. That is where Miss Hall comes in. Excuse me? Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship... which he took very seriously. She walked away, and he's been wanting her back ever since. We believe she's our surest and quickest way of locating him. And then what? Well, make sure she continues to see him, gets him to confide in her, and report to you. You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief. Well, then I misled you, or you made the wrong assumption. Either way, we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done. Voluntarily, I might add. No, she's got no training for this kind of thing. What, to go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman. She's got all the training she needs. I don't think I can get her to do it. - You mean it'll be difficult. - Very. Well, this is not Mission Difficult, Mr. Hunt, it's Mission Impossible. Difficult should be a walk in the park for you. I'm open to suggestion. If you can think of a quicker way, you're welcome to try. You might take a look at these... if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job. How many people are capable of something like that? Sean Ambrose, for one. Right. This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah. But it is what you'd like me to do. What? Oh, let my conscience be my guide, is that it? Something like that. I don't have a conscience. I'm a bloody thief. Are you gonna try and force me to do this? Generally, I don't favor coercing someone, not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands. - Is that the only reason? - Can you think of a better one? Me? No. But I was just hoping that you might, thinking that somewhere, this got personal as well as physical! Would it make you feel any better if I didn't want you to do this? - Yeah, much. - Then feel better! You know, Sean will never be anything but suspicious... if I pitch up saying, ''Hey, honey, I'm home. '' What wouldn't make him suspicious? That I needed him in some urgent way. Destitute. In serious trouble. The kind I couldn't possibly sort out myself. Serious trouble, Nyah, is something that I can always arrange. This transponder chip is completely untraceable. It transmits your location to a satellite... which can be read by only this computer. We can then track you to within three feet. Anywhere. Since your arrest, I've been sending news bulletins... to every law enforcement agency. I know Sean Ambrose, and I guarantee that after that airline crash, he's monitoring everyone of them. He knows you're there. And he has the means to get you out. Nyah... Nyah... I'm not gonna lose you. Ethan Hunt? G'day, mate. I'm William Baird. Billy's okay. Anything you need me to get, move or watch, just let me know. I'll have a look around. - Shit. - Yes, it is. This ain't funny. I just bought these $800 Gucci shoes, and you got me in a helicopter with this man? Computer's up. We got her. Let's put in the coordinates and get a visual. Visuals aren't coming up. The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do. Yeah, I heard about you, Luther. Just wanna say it's an honor... and a pleasure to be working with you blokes. Come on. Isn't there any way we can speed this up? With what? This is the only computer that'll do this. Ohhh! Ethan, here we go. Aye. Now, there's a bloke who knows how to give a proper welcome. Don't get me wrong, mate. You were very friendly also. - Is it him? - It's him, Billy. - So we've got him! - We don't know what we've got. 'Cause we don't know what he's got, where he's got it or what he's doing in Sydney with it. - Not much luggage. - I left in a bit of a hurry. I'm incredibly grateful, Sean. How in the world did you find me? How I usually find you, Nyah. Magic. Mmm, mmm! No flies on her. No bugs, either. No transmissions. She's clean. All cats are. - Your room? - Mmm. - And my room? - Hmm. She did it. She's in the compound. Yeah? We just rolled up a snowball and tossed it into hell. Now we'll see what chance it has. Try it on. Go ahead. I'm dying to see if I remembered your size. You're not interested in seeing how it looks? Oh, I am. Later. Every search for a hero... must begin with something that every hero requires-- a villain. Therefore, in the search for our hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster, Chimera. Nekhovich was a molecular biologist. Why is he going on about an old Greek myth? Nekhovich specialized in recombining DNA molecules. In the myth, Bellerophon was a prince who killed the Chimera. A monster with the head of a lion... and the tail of a serpent... who plagued the ancient world. I think Nekhovich created a monster virus named Chimera... and the antivirus to kill it, named Bellerophon. That simple, huh? Why not? 37 million. Now, that's a promising bid for Nekhovich's work. Don't look so worried, Hugh. We're halfway there. We'll need this at the track... if we're gonna get the other half. Well, then... sorted. Not everything. Why do you think she's really here? From her point of view or mine? Well, she wasn't exactly gagging for it... when she left you six months ago. The question is, do you trust her? One considers her timing, of course. Getting nicked within a week of the plane going down. Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive. Well, you've thought about it, at any rate. Tell me, Hugh, you don't exactly hang on Nyah's every word and gesture, do you? That's a fairly ratty nail that. Sean, please! Suppose she is some sort of Trojan horse sent in by IMF to spy on us. Why should I deny myself the pleasure of a ride or two? Or don't you think I can learn more from her than she can from me? I do! I do! I do! I do! Now, Hugh, you must realize that some of us... have the burden of sex to deal with. And I may or may not know why she thinks she's here, but I'm willing to take the risk, because, Hugh, I am gagging for it. Come on! Darling! You won! - I suppose I did. - What made you pick that nag? He's never won a bloody thing. - ''Thief in the Night.'' - Say no more. I'm, uh-- I'm off to grab a drink. Do you still favor the Bellinis? Mmm. ''Naturally Vain.'' Pardon me? Naturally Vain... in the fourth. Check her out. She's due. You can speak as if I'm right by your side. Where are you? Mounting enclosure just off the track, 2:00. How's it going? Just like old times. Just like old times? Just about. Tell me who you've run into at Ambrose's. Near as I can tell, there's about a half dozen other blokes about the place. Maybe more. Hugh Stamp, old friend of Sean's. He's the only one I recognize. And a bit of a creep and then some. We know him. He's over your left shoulder, looking at you right now. Ambrose has photos of newspapers with money piled on them. Thirty seven million on the London Times. What's that about? Bids from possible Chimera buyers. Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke. Ginger hair. They're into something. - Who is this guy? - Checking now, Ethan. John McCloy, CEO Biocyte Pharmaceuticals. In 1989, acquired Biocyte in a hostile takeover. He was Nekhovich's boss. Right. He worked for him as a research scientist at Biocyte. Ambrose is showing something to McCloy on a digital camera. Whatever McCloy's looking at, he's not happy about it. Ambrose just pulled... the camera's memory card and put it into an envelope. Put it in his inner left jacket pocket. Confirm left jacket pocket. Roger that. Nyah. Nyah, Ambrose is on his way back to you. - There's an envelope inside-- - His left jacket pocket. That's right. - Where do I meet you? - Betting table 12, off the paddock. - Are you sure you're up to this? - I'll muddle through. - There you are! - See anything you like? Well, yeah. ''Naturally Vain.'' But they're about to close the betting, and I haven't a bean. - Nyah! - Would you mind terribly? Not at all. But, um, you are gonna pay for it. - And with interest. - I have no doubt. Hold on. Put down a thousand for me. - To win? - What else? -Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed. -No worries, mate. -Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed. -No worries, mate. Luther, digital camera ready to transmit. Betting table 12. - There you go. - Fine. Oh, sorry about that, mate. Say again? Whatever you're about, in future, watch your step. Never know who you might run into. So where's the loo? Thanks, mate. How'd you do? Don't turn around. I managed. You turned around. What are you gonna do? Spank me? I'm booted up. Go, Ethan. Are you getting this? ''Sergei Gradski.: 20 hours after exposure. '' God. Stamp 's out of the loo. He's coming out of the tunnel, heading your way, mate. - I want you out of Ambrose's place. - What are you talking about? What's happened? What did you see? Okay, he's coming up behind you, Ethan. You've done your job. I want you out of Australia. - Thirty steps. - How do you suggest I go about it? He's touched your heart. You need to think it over. Fifteen, fourteen, twelve, eleven. I want you out of there now. Give me the earpiece. - Nine, Ethan. Eight. - If you don't get out of there, I'm coming in and getting you out. Ethan, get out of there! You placed your bet, ma'am? Just. Horses are ready to race. They're off! Come on! Come on! Your nag's making a run for it on the outside! Come on! Come on! You picked another winner! I thought you were going to dinner. Hugh, take care of the Nekhovich memory card. Where is it? In the envelope in my jacket pocket. My right jacket pocket. We at our state-of-the-art solar-powered Biocyte building, recognize that eternal vigilance is the price of health, whether it's funding the teaching center at the Royal Prince Edward Hospital, removing aerosol products from the market... or braving the influenza quarantine at Bruny Island late last month. At Biocyte, your life is our life's work. We've got an opportunity here. I'm not going to miss it. George, take me home. George? George! What the hell? George! George! George! Sean? Sean? Shhh. Easy. Oh, Ethan. Are you okay? Yeah, I am now. - What is this? - A visit from an old friend. You crashed on the plane. You're dead. Dead, certainly. But dead is a little extreme. On the other hand, when my colleague Gradski had your pulse... and your blood pressure, he had less than a day to live. You are infected with Chimera, my friend. No use, my friend. The medical staff wants no part of this. Doctors don't fancy the idea of dying any more than anybody else. How could I possibly be infected? That's exactly what Gradski said 27 hours before he died. You've got the antidote, you miserable bastard! - You stole Bellerophon! All of it! - My, my, my. I need it! I need it now, you whacked-out Russian Gypsy! And what about Gradski, who you deliberately infected with Chimera? How was I to know they needed... to be treated with Bellerophon within 20 hours? - By asking me. - You still don't get it, do you? I needed to know just how bad the disease was in the real world, not just the lab. You were genetically splicing together strains of influenza... to create a cure for all influenzas. But you were also creating a disease so terrible in Chimera, the cure would be priceless. I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon. It's not that difficult to understand, is it? Look, I've got the virus. You've got the cure. I need them both. Time was a shot of penicillin would knock off... every bloody bug in the zoo. Not anymore. If I couldn't make money killing the microscopic little shits out there, well, you'd help me put one out there that I could make money on. Well, there it is. I've confessed. I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money. Now, forget any deal you may have made with that thug Ambrose. Get me treated, and let's go back to work. You know, I think it's a little late for that. Do give my regards to Gradski... if you see him. Well... I've heard... all I need to hear. Nyah... it's imperative that we do nothing to alarm Ambrose. What? You told me to get out of there as soon as possible. -I thought you were here to collect me! -Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh! Listen to me. There's no time to talk. It is critical, absolutely critical, that you do whatever Ambrose asks. Do you understand me? Don't worry. It will all be over... very soon. That's a promise. Go on. Go on. Off you go. Luther, we know this much. Nekhovich gets on a plane... to go to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. He's carrying a virus he created, Chimera, and the cure for that virus, Bellerophon. Ambrose doesn't have the virus. That's why Ambrose needs McCloy. So we go into Biocyte, kill Chimera, Ambrose has a cure without a disease, and we're home free. You were right. Hunt stung McCloy tonight. So he knows. He'll be going into Biocyte. Good. Then we'll know where he'll be, don't we? Well done, Hugh. Well done. Oi! You're home, mate. Home. Where's George? My regular driver? Where is he? He's gone home sick. Touch of the flu. -Is the building up and running yet? -Mmm. -That's not exactly it. -Sorry, but this is a Biocyte facility. Their storage structure. I'll have it up in a minute. - Okay, take a look at this. - Start from the inside out. All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the 42ndfloor. Hunt's target will be the Chimera, stored and manufactured at Biocyte on the 42nd floor. If you look at Hunt's operational history, and I have, he invariably favors misdirection over confrontation. He'll never break into Biocyte from the bottom where security is heaviest. No garage entrances. Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol. Not goin' in from the ground. Show me the atrium. The atrium? One of a kind. Runs down through the center of the building. Provides 24-hournaturallight via mirrors and daylight storage cells. Optimal growing conditions for the virus. Ends in a glass floor which doubles as part of the lab ceiling. Uh-uh. The atrium roof closes at sundown. And if the louvers are up for more than 40seconds at night, the civil emergency alarms are tripped. Those, even I can't stop. Ethan, we have a total of 40 seconds... to get you in and the cables out. No, Hunt will prefer to enter Biocyte somewhere from the top... where security is minimal. He'll undoubtedly engage in some aerobatic insanity... before he'll risk harming a hair on a security guard's head. - Check-check. Got copy? - You're five-by-five. Luther, how we doin '? Not there yet, Ethan. I'll give you the word. Billy, ready to go? Okay, package away in five-- I'm not ready. The louvers aren't moving. Come on, Luther! We gotta go! Wait, there's a glitch in the access code. Luther, we're out of time. On the count. Please, baby, open up, open up. - Five, four, - Come on! three, two, one! - I'm going now! - Ethan, wait! Twenty five, twenty four, twenty three, twenty two, twenty one, twenty. Ethan, you've got 19seconds to clear the cable. Okay, retracting cable! Come on! Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two-- Cable's clear! Transponder activated. Reading package and cable clear. He'll breach the lab at the only possible time, whether you break in from the ground or the roof. It's 2300 hours, one minute... when the air filtration generators will cover the sound of Hunt's break-in... and the rotating guards make the building vulnerable... to our break-in from below. Ethan, the generator's about to go active. Just a friendly reminder. We'll be out of contact for eight minutes. I'm betting Hunt will destroy Chimera... rather than attempt to preserve any part of it. He'll have to do it in two places. First, the incubation room where the growth vials are kept. And finally, in the inoculation chamber... holding the last remaining Chimera virus in three injection guns. He won't be allowed to destroy the virus in those guns. What's this? You're on time, for once? Not exactly, sport. John C. McCloy. Billy, I think we've got a problem. Nyah's on the wing up early. Billy, do you copy? Yeah, I got you, Luther. Sorry, exactly where is she? - In the building. - Say again, mate. Sounds like you're saying she's in the building. I am. She is. Uh, well, then she's not likely to be alone, is she, mate? She's in the elevator, headed towards Ethan. The question is.: How many of them? I can't get through to Ethan, not till the generators go. - Yeah, well, when's that? - Not for another... five-and-a-half minutes. Chimera in vitro pH and temperature level... outside optimal range. Chimera in vitro pH and temperature level... outside optimal range. Chimera working seed stock pH at critical level. Alert. Chimera stock life threatened. Alert. Chimera stock life terminated. Come on, Ethan. Come on. Subject is contaminant-free. Zero contaminant factor. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Luther, what the hell can we do? What can we do? Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one. However we travel, I must arrive at my destination within 20 hours of departure. How was I to know that he needed to be treated... with Bellerophon within 20hours? Get him. How much longer before you can reach him? We've got29seconds before the generators turn off, then Ethan will be back on-line. Ahh! Luther! Luther! Hold your fire! Hold your fire, damn it! Well, Hunt... how've you been? Fighting a bit of a cold. Aww. You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you-- grinning like an idiot every 15 minutes. I would've thought the hardest part was curbing that pressing need of yours... to get your gun off. You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747... you never figured out where Chimera really was. - I knew where it was. - Oh. Then you knew the only way Nekhovich could smuggle the live virus... is by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a petri dish. You knew that... while you were knocking him off, destroying the very thing you came for. Stop! Put a sock in it! Hit that bloody gun, and you'll spray the virus all over the place! There it is, guys. The last of it. What was the top bid? Why? You gonna make me a better offer? Than 37 million? Not really. Oh! Somebody has been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl. Sean, she doesn't belong here. Let her go. She wouldn't be here... if it wasn't for you, Hunt. From this moment, you are responsible for what happens to her. And if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the injection gun and bring it to me. Ball's in your court, Hunt. Nyah's in the building. Do you copy? Thank you. How do you know he won't shoot you the minute he's got it? Please. One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions. You know women, mate. Like monkeys they are. Won't let go of one branch till they get a grip on the next! Get it, Nyah. I'll cover you. I am waiting. Things haven't exactly worked out the way you thought they would, Ethan. Sorry. You bitch! You're not gonna shoot me, Sean. Not this bitch. 'Cause she's worth 37 million. - What did you think you were doing? - I wasn't thinking! Just trying to stop you from getting hurt, that's all! You who don't have a conscience. I guess I lied. You can't get us both out of here, can you? I'm infected with Chimera. You know you don't have a choice. Just do it. Do it now! We've got 19 hours and 58 minutes! I'll get Bellerophon into your system before then! Just stay alive! I'm not going to lose you! Feel like pleading for your life? Well, then, how about dying... so you can make me a lot of money? In just a few hours time, you can be assured... of going down in history as the Typhoid Mary of Oz. G'day. There's not a chance of locating Nyah until can access the satellite. And there's not a chance of doing that until I can get this computer fixed. How much time does she have left? Not long. But whatever happens, Nyah will take care of Nyah. -What do you mean? -Unless we dose her with Bellerophon, Nyah will kill herself. So first things first. Ethan, Ambrose and his team have arrived... over the bridge, and Nyah's not with him, mate. Copy that. You all right, mate? Looks like pretty heavy security from here. What's it look like from there? Risky. Simon? Simon! Stay here. Breached the structure at the 10:00 grating. It's a DNA match. The blood's loaded with Chimera. And they certainly have Bellerophon. Well, then you've got both the virus and the antivirus, which means I've got 30 million for you. Not exactly. We don't want just your cash. - What do you want? - Stock, Mr. McCloy. Stock options, to be a little more precise. Cut her loose... right in the center of town. The more crowded the better. Ethan, just picked up an Ambrose call. Nyah's been dropped off. - Where is she? - Somewhere in Sydney. Somewhere in Sydney? Care to harden the target? I can't until... I can get the GPS up on our computer. It's down. The clock is ticking. How quickly can you manufacture more of the antivirus? No time at all, once I've got it. Good. Biocyte stock is just a few weeks away from going through the roof. - What are you talking about? - An outbreak of Chimera. - Where? - Downtown Sydney, for a start. You create the supply, Mr. McCloy. We've just created the demand. Three million people in Sydney... and 17 million people in Australia... are going to need Bellerophon within the next few days, not to mention the rest of the world. Now, this is how it's going to work. - Wallis, the shares outstanding are? -93.4 million. Which means, Mr. McCloy, we need to get our hands on 480,000 options. We'll borrow your 30 million to buy those options. Your stock has never sold above $3 1 a share. When your stock goes north of 200, which it will, those options will be worth billions, and I will own 51% of Biocyte. This is outrageous. I will not let you take control of my company. Sit down. You'll be a billionaire. It's better than being broke. I have terrorists and... other pharmaceutical companies standing in line. The ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy. Run that bastard down. We're running short on time, Mr. McCloy. We have got to conclude our business. Yes. Start the transfer. Follow it... and let me know. Uh! Raise your hands very slowly. Sure you want me to do this? Raise your hands very slowly. Ethan, Ethan, do you copy? Do you copy? Keep it going! Sean, this rat's reached the end of the maze. Is he alive? Yeah, more or less. Bring him to me. Go! Sean, transfer completed. Well done, Stamp. Well done. Stop mumbling! I'm afraid he's got no choice. I believe I broke his jaw. Stamp, I'm impressed. Right. We don't have a lot of time, Hunt. What ever you got to say, say it now. How about giving us a big smile? - No? - What are you doing? Get down on your knees. Now, this is what's known... as getting your gun off. There he is! Ethan! Just back off and pinpoint your positions! Luther, clear the bridge for me! Hunt's heading for the bridge, coming in at 12:00 high. Oh, I'm mad now. Ha-ha! -You all right, mate? -That punk put a hole in my Versace! Ethan, the computer's up. I've got Nyah. She's moved out of the city. She's on the north head bluff approaching the cliffs. - But I can't get a visual. - Copy! She's only got a little time left! Track ahead and pick her up! -I can't get a good shot. -Ethan, we won't be able to cover you! My earpiece is failing! You've got me on GPS! Bring her to me! Billy, north head bluff. Haul ass. - Get out there and keep firing! - I can't see anything! Slow down, mate! Slow down! Range is 2K. Ahhh! Go ahead. Use it, Hunt. It's not a bad way to go. It's a lot better than the way that bitch is gonna die. Hey, there she is! Hunt! You should've killed me. Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus, not even antibodies. Yes. I gathered as much. But you were under specific instructions, Mr. Hunt, to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus. I'd be very interested to know how, after you managed this recovery, it subsequently got destroyed. By fire. It's the best way, really. Oh. Well, Mr. Hunt, as for Miss Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal record will certainly be expunged. Wiped out. I'm assuming you approve. I do. Yeah. Where is she now, by the way? Any idea? I don't know. Not exactly. So, what are your plans? I don't know. Uh, some sort of vacation. I'll let you know where I'm going. You don't have to do that. It wouldn't be a vacation if you did. Let's get lost., Hey, hey, watch out. Watch out. Welcome, my friend. Great to see you. Yeah, glad you made it. This can't be Ajit. He's a little man already. - Unbelievable. - I hope you're hungry, Adrian. I'm famished. How are you, Aparna? - I made that fish curry you love. - I can't wait. She gets more beautiful every time I see her. Why is that? Strange, isn't it? But her fish curry is still awful. You were mysterious on the phone. Why didn't you attend the conference? - I will show you, Adrian, sir. - Satnam, stop ""siring"" me. How deep do we need to go? Eleven thousand feet. I searched all over India for this thing. Used to be the deepest copper mine in the world. Remember my brother, Gurdeep? He's a student now. Namaste, Dr. Helmsley, sir. Adrian. It's just Adrian. Just don't pour too much, huh? How do you work in this heat? You've come on a good day, my friend. Sometimes it can hit 120 degrees. You have to come and meet Dr. Lokesh... ...a Fellow of quantum physics at the university in Chennai. Dr. Helmsley. So, what are we looking at? These are neutrinos acting normally. Minuscule mass, no electrical charge. They pass through ordinary matter almost undisturbed. Your message said the count doubled after the last solar eruptions. That was last week. But this happened two days ago. The biggest Sun eruptions in human history... ...causing the highest neutrino count we've ever recorded. My God. That's not what worries me, Adrian. For the first time ever... ...the neutrinos are causing a physical reaction. That's impossible. That feels very good. Please, follow me. You won't believe this. This water tank goes down another 6000 feet. It looks like the neutrinos coming from the Sun... ...have mutated into a new kind of nuclear particle. They're heating up the Earth's core... ...and suddenly act like microwaves. Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, no speech... ...just a thank-you... ...because tonight, with your extraordinary generosity... ...we have raised $1.7 million. Have a stiff drink, because I'm locking the doors... - ... and passing the hat around again. - It's okay. It's okay. - I work for the White House. - I don't care. This is a black-tie event. Scotty. Hey. Adrian, I thought you were in India. What's going on? - I need yourjacket. - What? I gotta speak to Anheuser. Give me your damn jacket, please. - All right. - Okay? - All right, here. Here. - Hold that for a minute, will you? Hey! Easy, that's a $600 jacket. Mr. Anheuser? Mr. Anheuser. I need to talk to you. - Do I know you? - Sorry, sir. My name's Dr. Adrian Helmsley. I'm a deputy geologist at the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Excuse me, fellas. You know that this is a fundraiser, not a frat party, right? - It's important, sir. - You know what? It always is. Make an appointment with my... You know, even better: Have your boss bring it up at the quarterly briefing. There's a good plan. I just traveled 20 straight hours to get here, sir. I haven't slept in two days. You need to read this, sir. You need to read it now. Let me guess, national geology crisis? Excuse me. - Who do you report to? - Lee Cavazos. Not anymore. Alan, bring the car around. - You're gonna wish you took a shower. - Sir? You're about to meet the president. What's going on? Get that to the office. No G8! No G8! No G8! Good morning. I would like to meet privately with my fellow heads of state. Mr. Makarenko wishes to have his interpreters present. Mr. President, I can assure you... ...your English is more than sufficient for what I have to say. Mr. Presidents. Six months ago... ...I was made aware of a situation so devastating... ...that, at first, I refused to believe it. However... ...through the concerted efforts... ...of our brightest scientists... ...we have confirmed its validity. The world as we know it... ...will soon come to an end. This dam project will create many newjobs. The Party and country will assist in your relocation. Grandma, give me your hand. - But where are they taking us? - It'll be all right. Brother! Grandma, I will send you money. Who can write? Who can read? Who can weld? Has His Highness had an opportunity to study the dossier? You must understand, I have a very big family, Mr...? Isaacs. One billion dollars is a lot of money. I'm afraid the amount is in euros, Your Highness. I put a lot of faith into your organization. It's a perfect replica, Roland. There are too many fanatics out there that could damage her. Just think about the beautiful Buddha statues they blew up in Afghanistan. Our Heritage Organization has already made selections... ...from the British Museum and L'Hermitage. I guess she'll be safe now, tucked away... ...hidden in some bunker in Switzerland. Perfectly safe, Roland. Only infrared analysis would reveal the difference. But it's still a fake. This mass suicide was actually discovered by a documentary crew... ...here in the ancient Mayan city of Tikal. Now, the victims, and we've seen many... ...are said to have adhered to the Mayan-Quiche calendar... ...which predicts the end of time to occur... ...on the 21st of December of this year... ...due to the Sun's destructive forces. Thank you, Mark. Strangely enough, scientific records do support the fact... ...that we are heading for the biggest solar climax in recorded history. Well, yes. Apparently many people believe that the Mayan calendar predicts... ...that there's supposed to be a galactic alignment... I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man. ...it's the end of the world in 2012. Goddamn it. Hey, Kate. I'm practically on the freeway right now. Yes, I'm hurtling toward you as we speak. Will you relax? Yeah, I'll be there any second. You know it's a vacation and not a doctor's appointment, right? That it's supposed to be fun? You remember fun, don't you, Kate? Do you remember where you were when it stopped being fun for you? Yeah. I got it. Bug spray? Oh, yeah, because it's mosquito season in Yellowstone. I got a whole bunch. Okay, I gotta go, because I'm in a bad-reception area. Whoa, man. Would you look at that? Sick. Merrill, I told you. We have to move back to Wisconsin. Yeah, but these little mini-quakes are really getting on my nerves. A little surface crack? You're not gonna be inconvenienced by that. Right, surface cracks. I got a plastic surgeon for that. Thank God for those shake-proof coffee mugs, Lisa. They show the true nature of us Californians. We'll not bow to these inconvenient things like surface cracks. If you have a funny mini-quake story and wanna share it, call 555-1070... - Hi, Daddy. - Hi, baby. - How are you, sweetie? - Good. Jackson, what is this? Please don't call me that. I'm your dad. Come on. You're taking them camping in a limo? Okay, great. What happened to your temp job? Oh, you know, better hours, more time to write. What about sleeping? Have you been doing any of that lately? I've said it a thousand times, no lipo on Fridays. It's too messy. Hold on. - Morning, Jackson. - Hi. - Nice ride. - Thanks. Guys, have a nice trip. Remember, watch out for the bears. You know, they're: Bye, Gordon. - Love you, honey. - Bye. - Okay, so, Lil... Oh, yeah. - You tell him. Tell me what? She needs to put these on before she goes to sleep. - Still? - Yes. Your 7-year-old still wets her bed. That's something you should know. - I love you. - Love you, Mom. - Hey. - You okay? They've been looking forward to spending time with you. I know. - So don't be on your computer. - Got it. Love you. - So this time, we hit Japan. - So? Well, you could visit your boy, Will. Afternoon, ladies. - Hello there. - Hello, handsome. Are you even listening to me? Unfortunately, I am, Harry. I heard from Audrey you're a grandpa now. Would you mind keeping your nose out of my family? You're cramping my style, baby. There we are. So he married a Japanese girl. How is that the end of the world? Come on, Tony. You should at least go see him. - You see your boy? - Not as much as I'd like. D.C. is a long way, but at least we talk. About what? Life, and how short it is. What the hell was that? Hello? Laura. Laura, can you hear me? Roland, is that you? Laura, they lied to us. I've arranged a press conference for tomorrow. I will tell everyone the truth about what's going on. What are you talking about? The art you collected... ...it's not in the Alps. Those tunnels are empty. I have proof! Laura. Laura, can you hear me? - I'm losing you. Roland? - Laura, can you hear me? Laura. Break it down. - I liked that song. - We lost it. ...going on the West Coast with all those surface cracks. I told myself, ""Charlie, get your stupid ass to Yellowstone. "" I don't want to miss all the fun when it finally blows. Let me tell you, there's been government people... ...flying in and out all morning, and trust me, they did not look happy. - Always remember folks: - That's weird. - You heard it first from Charlie. - Yeah, just when he said that? What are the odds? We're not seeing soil liquefaction we'd expect... ...or any evidence of fracture propagation within the tectonic plates. - In English. - The activity on the coast... ...is not caused by tecto... By regular earthquakes. And these surface cracks have nothing to do with shifting fault lines. You suggesting this could be the beginning of the Cho Ming operation? Dr. Helmsley is flying to Yellowstone this morning to collect more data. We have been following the schedule you established, Mr. Helmsley. The most important schedule in the history of mankind. Now you're telling me we have to throw it out? Yes, sir. I was wrong. Do you know how many times I've heard those words in this office? Zero. Did you see this? I'm sorry, Mr. President. She insisted. It's all over the news. We are learning more about this deadly car explosion. The director of the French National Museums... ...was to hold a press conference at the Louvre this morning. Coincidentally, his death took place in the same Paris tunnel... ...where Princess Diana died in 1997. We are continuing to follow this story. We will... Laura, I don't believe you've met Dr. Helmsley. I just talked to him, Dad, and he told me... ...that the organization that I work for is a sham. I mean, why would he say that? You look just like your mother when you get upset. Did I ever tell you that? Every time I get upset. Daddy, a man was killed. Honey, please sit down. Only a dozen people in this administration... ...know what I'm about to tell you. Dad, what's going on? An unprecedented international endeavor is underway. At this point, 46 nations are invested in this thing. Laura's a smart girl. She'll understand. That thing in Paris, we're not involved in any of that, are we? We? Who the hell is ""we""? What are you talking about? We need to focus on this timeline. That's what we need to do. - When do we let the country know? - What do you mean? The people, sir. They need to know. Well, of course they do. Listen, yourjob is to figure out when this is all gonna fall apart. My job is to figure out... ...how to retain some semblance of government after it falls apart. Until then, we don't have time for anything... ...except for doing those jobs. Okay? Call me the moment you get any news from Yellowstone. Yes, sir. Cute girl, huh? - Sir? - The First Daughter. - I saw you looking at her. - I wasn't looking at her. Better move fast, kid. The end is near. Adrian, your chopper's ready. They're waiting on the South Lawn. Daddy, where are we going? Going to this really special place that I know. It's a place where your mom and I used to hang out a lot. I don't wanna know where you and Mom had sex. - I'm not ready for that, Jackson. - Stop calling me that. It's creeping me out. What's wrong with ""Dad""? - Grumpy Grumperson. - Daddy, look at this. That wasn't here before. What do we do? Go get your hat. Don't you see the signs? Used to be a lake here. Doesn't look much of a lake to me. I know, the whole damn thing's gone. - Come on, let's check it out. - Grwat. Subjects have now entered hot zone. Who is that? That's the U.S. Army. All manner of government vehicle are converging on subjects. You're in a restricted area, sir. - We need you to come with us. - Right. Right. Okay, we're gonna go with these guys. That'll be fun, huh? This is wild. This is really wild. This is unbelievable. 2700 degrees Celsius at 40,000 feet? I know, it sounds completely implausible. Nonetheless, we're ticking off an increase of almost 0.5 percent. - Per day? - No. Per hour. Dr. Helmsley. We've arrested a group of tourists in the hot zone. Okay, I'll take care of it. Look, let's get Satnam on the communications link. We'll try and cross-reference the data. It's a national park. There's not supposed to be posted fences. I mean, what's going on here? We're geologists. Do you usually go digging with machine guns? Major, I'll take care of this. Thank you. - What happened to the lake? - That's what we're trying to find out. We think the entire area has become unstable. I think you should take your kids and leave, Mr. Curtis. You're not by any chance the Jackson Curtis... ...who wrote Farewell Atlantis, are you? The very same. It's actually dedicated to my mom. That's great. I read a couple of your short stories when I was in college. Yeah. You know, your father is a very talented man. - Listen up. - It's amazing. I'm reading your book. I'm around day 300, the shuttle has just lost communication with Earth. You're one of the lucky few who bought it. - I didn't buy it. - No? My dad gave it to me. Let me ask you something. You believe those people would behave so selflessly... ...knowing that their own lives were at stake? I hope so. The critics said I was naive, an unabashed optimist... ...but what do they know, right? Well... - Pleasure. - It was a great pleasure meeting you. Major, could you escort these good people to the campgrounds? This is yours. - Thank you. - Yes, sir. - Take care. - Okay. He was very nice. You're just saying that because he liked my book. Looks like that boy of yours is gonna be smarter than any of us. What's wrong? I sent Satnam the temperature reading. My colleagues in Argentina and Ontario have almost identical data. It's so hot here, we've had to seal off the mine. - Double-checked the numbers? - Triple-checked, my friend. I wish we were wrong... ...but we're not. The Earth's crust is destabilizing. It's too early. Adrian, you have to begin the evacuation. My God. All our scientific advances, our fancy machines... The Mayans saw this coming thousands of years ago. I thought we'd have more time. Okay. I want you to pack up your family. I'm gonna arrange an airlift for you from Delhi. Thank you, my friend. And good luck. Ajit. We are going on a big ship. - That was so cool. - Yeah, that was intense. - The helicopters. - Craziest place I've seen. - Those helicopters were so cool. - Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Sorry. One question: What did the government guys say to you? Well, they don't like us going over their fences... ...and that the whole area back there is unstable. Unstable. They said ""unstable""? Yeah, unstable. That's funny. Let's go. Have a good one. Unstable. It's not just Yellowstone, sir. Temperatures are rising with incredible velocity... ...in hot zones across the globe. Are you absolutely sure about this, Adrian? Because once we give these orders... ...there's no going back. You understand that? I'm afraid there's no longer any doubt, sir. We have to save what we can. And we have to move now! There's mosquitoes in here. Did anybody spray the tent? I'm gonna get that spray tomorrow. They just like you because your blood's so sweet. Dad, you said you wouldn't work on your book. What, Lil'bee? I'm not, I'm not. I'm just... I'm doing something else. Let me get you ready for... Ready for bed. Okay. Did you really need all these hats? - Where are your Pull-Ups, sweetie? - I have them on. Who gave you this, Mommy? No, Gordon gave it to me for my birthday. A cell phone is something we gotta talk about, you know, as a family. What family? That hurts my feelings when you say stuff like that. Just go away. Adults get... ...hurt feelings too. We have a listener calling in. Bill from Cooke City, you're on the Charlie Frost Show. Charlie, just wanted to say I love your show. No way. ...not afraid to tell the truth. Thank you, Bill. What is your question? I wanted to know, where is all this gonna start? Well, something like this could only originate in Hollywood, Bill. They got the Earth cracking under their asses already. Our family believes in the gospel of the Lord Jesus. - We have nothing to fear, Charlie. - Good for you, Bill. Thanks for calling. This is Charlie Frost reporting live from Yellowstone National Park... ...soon to become the world's largest active volcano. I'll be right back, folks. Do you mind if I join you? I wanted to ask you something. I only got a minute. Hey. Pickle? No. I was listening to the broadcast and I was wondering... ...what exactly is it that's gonna start in Hollywood? It's the apocalypse. End of days. The Judgment Day, the end of the world, my friend. Christians called it the rapture, but the Mayans knew about it... ...the Hopis, the I Ching... ...the Bible, kind of... Beer? - Yeah. - So look, I gotta eat. Why don't you download my blog. It's free. Of course, we do appreciate donations. In ancient times, the Mayan people were the first civilization to discover... ...that this planet had an expiration date. According to their calendar... ...in the year 2012, a cataclysmic event will unfold... ...caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system... ...that only happens every 640,000 years. Oh, not again. Pretty neat, huh? I did all the animation myself. Just imagine the Earth as an orange. You lure them in with humor. Then you make them think. Our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation... Those little bastards are called neutrinos. ...that the core of the Earth will melt. That's the inside part of the orange... ...leaving the crust of our planet free to shift. In 1958, Professor Charles Hapgood named it Earth Crust Displacement. Albert Einstein did support it. People, we'll get it all. The forces of Mother Nature will be so devastating... ...it will bring an end to this world on winter solstice, 12-21-12. Always remember, folks, you heard it first from Charlie Frost. You'd have to keep a thing like this under wraps. I mean, just think about it, okay? First, the stock market would go. Then the economy, boom! The dollar, boom! And then pandemonium in the streets. War, genocide, boom, boom, boom! Bullshit. Nobody could keep that big a secret, Charlie. - Somebody would blow the whistle. - Every once in a while... ...some poor little sucker tries. Well, like these guys, boom, boom! Every one of these guys, dead, dead, dead. That's Professor Meyers. He ran the Atlantis shuttle program. Why, did you know him? Yeah, he helped me with research on my book. Well, that must have been before his ""accident. "" Meyers is dead? Oh, yeah, two months ago. He was one of my most avid listeners... ...and he had it all figured out. Everything the government was doing, where and why... He even sent me a map. A map for what, Charlie? What's the map for? They're building spaceships, man. Shit, man, I have to go... ...because I gotta get back to Earth. - But do you got a traveler for the road? - This is my last... Oh, that'll be all right. But, anyway, I really enjoyed most of this. Thank you so much. Hey. Hey, guess what. - They're selling seats. - Put me down for three. No, guys like you and me don't have a chance. You'd have to be Bill Gates or Rupert Murdoch... ...or some Russian billionaire or something. Keep it down, my kids are sleeping. Get them out of Yellowstone. It's gonna get ugly here. Why don't we make a baby? We're not making a baby in the supermarket. Hey, hands off the merchandise. Honey, women pay me thousands of dollars to handle their boobs. You get it for free. You always act strange after he shows up. I'm not acting strange. I'm looking for the macaroni. So why did you stick with him so long? Can we just give it a rest, please? He's the father of my children. Oh, come on, Kate. You gave up med school so you could have Noah. You practically raised him and Lilly by yourself... ...while he sat writing that junk. It's not junk. He's published. Oh, published, right, I forgot. Four hundred and twenty-two copies. Did you see that? See what? Hey, Kate. Listen, we have to keep working at this, our relationship. I mean, I don't know, honey. I just feel like there's something pulling us apart. Gordon! Hang on! Hang onto the pole! Kate. Don't let go. - Oh, my God. - Hang on! Gordon! Do you have anything for mosquito bites? Before or after? I'd get before and after. Stop scratching. You're gonna get it all infected. I had to make a stop at the grocery store. It's Mrs. Birnbaum. She's my teacher, she's on TV. Here is Grayson's Market, which was open for business at the time... ...but fortunately, there were no fatalities or injuries reported. It really is a miracle that no one got hurt. Hello? Oh, hi, Mom. Did you see what happened to our supermarket? She wants us to come home. is this even possible? We worked every option through the night. The good news, consensus is that four of the arks will be operational in time. Only four? You call that good news? We can save over 400,000 people. To me, sir, that's nothing short of a miracle. But we have to initiate the boarding process now. Thomas. We don't have a choice. You have got to convince them. Listen, I'll try to keep this brief. According to the latest information from Yellowsto... - Please continue, Adrian. - Thank you, sir. The temperature of the subterranean crust... ...that is, the cement that holds our land mass in place... ...is increasing at a rapid rate, much faster than anticipated. As a result, we've observed extreme polar instability. The magnetic fields have decreased by more than 80 percent... ...in the last 48 hours. How much time do we have, Dr. Helmsley? Two, maybe three days, if we're lucky. How can you speak about luck in such a situation? Apologies, Mr. Prime Minister. I... I meant no disrespect. I'm afraid the longer we wait, the more luck plays its part. My friends... ...I recommend we evacuate immediately. If any of you have objections... ...please speak now. In the blue corner... ...38 victories, 34 knockouts... ...the fighting machine from the Ukraine... ...the undefeated number-one ranked heavyweight challenger: Mr. Zultan Balashin! - Yuri! - Zultan! I feared you would not come. He needs to concentrate now, Mr. Karpov. You shut up when I talk to my boy, understand? Yes, Mr. Karpov. Good. That is good. Zultan, listen to me... ...we are fighters, we never go down... ...no matter how hard they hit us. Kill the bastard. Kill the bastard, Zultan. Ladies and gentlemen... ...let's get ready to rumble! Zultan! Yuri, where are you going? Yuri? One, two, three... Caltech believes that the half-mile fissure running through Westwood... ...has released most of the surface tension. ""Life will soon return to normal,"" Mayor Gonzales said... - ... at an early news conference. - Okay, guys. Almost home. Rise and shine. All right, you're free. - Thank God. - Mommy. Hi, sweetheart. Gordon! Hey, buddy boy. Good time? Yeah? God, I missed you. Yeah. - Who wants pancakes? Come on. - Me. - Thanks for bringing them home early. - Yeah. Pancakes? Late for work. - Yes, hello? - Curtis, where are you? - Just getting back from vacation, sir. - Good. That is good. I will send the jet to pick up Alec and Oleg. Yuri bear, tell him to bring the raincoat for Caesar. - It's in the Range Rover. - Curtis. - Yeah? - Get my boys as fast as you can. I'm hurtling towards you as we speak, sir. Good. That is good. Curtis, you're late. Good morning to you too. Oh, be careful with our stuff. Don't get your dirt on it. Idiot. Took you a while, Mr. Curtis. What's your problem? Be more careful. He did that on purpose. Hey, have a safe trip, you little bastards. Now you're laughing, Curtis... ...but we have tickets to go on a big ship. We will live... ...and you will die. Folks, did you hear that? The authorities in L.A. say there's nothing to worry about. I'd love to see their dumb faces... ...when Malibu and Beverly Hills... ...get sucked into the gurgling maw of the Pacific. Where they gonna plug in their electric cars then? - Hey. is this your plane? - Yes. - Are you a pilot? - Yeah. I wanna rent it. I'll give you anything. Here. This is a very expensive watch. My editor gave it to me when he thought I was gonna be somebody. I confirmed with my people at Caltech that in the last 36 hours... ...we had basically zero earthquake activity in Southern California... ...which is very rare. Unlike many of the tough characters... - ... I've portrayed in my film career... - Hello? - Stop what you're doing. - Jackson? Listen to me. I've rented a plane. Pack up the kids. - I'm gonna be there in five minutes. - Plane? What? We're gonna do our regular Saturday. Noah has music and Lil has karate. Not that we'd expect him to remember. Kate, California is going down. Pack up the kids now! They just got back. God, you sound like a crazy person. The governorjust said we're fine now. The guy's an actor. He's reading a script. When they tell you not to panic... ...that's when you run! Okay, could you call me back when you calm down? Mommy, why is Daddy so crazy? ...taking the most severe hit in Los Angeles. Finish your pancakes, Al Capone. It seems to me that the worst is over. Mommy! Everyone hold on to each other. - No, Lilly! - Hold Mommy's hand and stay close. Daddy! Let's go! Let's go! I think it's safer under here! Get in the fucking car right now! Move your ass! Move! - Come on, kids. - Get up! - Move. Quick, quick! - Move! Go! Now! - Come on, let's go. - Run! Don't look back! - Come on! - Take her! Get in, honey, get in. My hats. Lilly, get in! Get in! - Buckle up! - Lilly. Sorry. Jackson, hurry up. Look behind you. - Holy...! - Oh, God. Get out of herw! Get out of the way! - Move it! - Hold on to those eggs, dear. - Come on! - Come on, you old bags! Sidewalk, sidewalk! Tree! Tree! God. Carwful. Everybody, hang on. Oh, my God. Careful, careful. Yikes. That stinks. We gotta get to the airport. Well, take the freeway, it'll be half the time. Yeah, right. Jesus. We gotta get to the other side of the freeway. Daddy! - Dad, look! - No. We're not gonna make it! Careful! - No, Daddy! - Dad, look. Dad, look. No, no, no! It's been upgraded to a 10.9 by the guys at Harvard. What does Caltech have to say? The whole city of Pasadena was wiped out just a few minutes ago. This is coming in from Coachella Valley out near Joshua Tree. That canyon? That wasn't there this morning. And 400 miles further north, Point Reyes, same thing. The San Andreas Fault is shifting. Yes. And all major sister faults in the Bay Area. The whole Pacific plate is destabilizing. Hold my hand. Stay close to me. Come on! - Who's that? - Our pilot! Oh, jeez. It's our pilot. Gordon. Gordon, you can fly. No, no, I've only had a couple of lessons in a single-engine plane only. - You're the guy. - I am not the guy. - Trust me, you're the guy. - I'm not being modest about this. Come on, kids. Gordon's gonna get us out of here. That plane has multiple engines. Jackson! - T's and P's, T's and P's. - T and P? - Temperatures and pressures. - Go! - I've gotta do my preflight check. - Let him concentrate. He has no experience. Thank you. - Gordon, go. - Come on. - Gordon! - Go, go, go! - We're not there yet. - Gordon, take off. - Punch it, punch it! - I have to get to 85 knots. - Eighty's good. - Oh, screw it. Here we go. Okay. Okay, we're up. Higher, higher! Oh, my God. Lilly, go sit with your brother. I don't understand. How did you know this was gonna happen? It is not just California. It's the whole goddamn world that's going to shit. I met this guy in Yellowstone, this crazy guy. He's been right about everything that's happened so far. And he said the government is building spaceships. - I don't know what, but something. - Ships? Yeah, places where we can be safe. He knows where they are. He's got a map. Jackson. Kate, you gotta just trust me on this, okay? Guys, look. There's a twist and a turn To each lesson you learn First you're up, then you're bust Livin' life on a crust But it ain't the end of the world, buddy It's only the end of this song It's been a gas, been a flip Been a hell of a trip But it ain't the end of the world Oh, yeah. Thank you. You got fans, Tony. There's a call for you. You want me to take a message? No, that's all right, Kevin. I got it. - Hello. - Dad? Adrian. Remember when I told you about that dam in China? Yeah. It's happening, Dad. They'd probably shoot me if they knew that I told you. Nobody's gonna shoot you, son. They need you. The president has ordered us to clear out the White House. About time somebody cleaned up that mess. Where are you, Dad? What exactly is the course of the Genesis right now? It's all good, Adrian. Don't you be worrying about your old man now. You got more important things to do now. You know... ...your mom and I, we... We had one hell of a great life, son. And the best part about that... ...is we had one hell of a great kid too. Now, you lookie here. The Genesis... ...it's a pretty big ship, son. So don't you write your old man off just yet. Besides... ...you know I couldn't leave Tony alone. You know that old fool can't keep decent time by himself. I love you, Dad. I love you too, son. God knows I do. Kevin, I want a double. - Harry. - I need a double right now. Thank you, son. After 25 years on the wagon, are you out of your mind? - What are you doing? - Gotta go. - That's against regulation. - Careful, careful. - Anything? - Yeah, there's fuel. Fill it up. I'm gonna find Charlie. Daddy, wait. I wanna come with you. - No, no. Lil. Lil, no! - It's all right. Just fill it up. - We'll be back. - Jackson, hurry, please. I'm standing here at the highest point... ...of what is the rim of the world's largest super-volcano... - ... Mount Bighorn, elevation 2779 feet. - Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! I can only hope that all of you have made your peace with God... - He's gotta be around somewhere. - Let's go back. No, no, no. We gotta find Charlie because he's got a map. It's like a secret map, like in the Pirate movies. - We gotta work as a team, okay? - Okay. Okay, come on. Call Mommy and tell her we're gonna be 5 minutes late. - Hello? - I need to talk to Mommy. - It's Lilly. - Sweetheart, where are you? - Hi, Mommy. - Let me speak to Daddy, sweetie. He can't talk right now. He's driving really, really bad. Any minute now, the fireworks are gonna start. Who is that? Who's speaking in the car? He's not in the car. He's on a mountain waiting for fireworks. - Fireworks? What fireworks? - Daddy. Daddy, over there. ...to send all of Yellowstone into outer space? Good job, Lilly. Good job. Let me talk to Mom. - Kate, we got him. - Jackson, bring back my child now. Okay. You stay here and guard the ship... - ... and I'm gonna go talk to the pirate. - Okay. ...your race, your country, your god. Whether you're a Christian or a Buddhist or Muslim or Rastafarian... - ... by tomorrow we will all be one! - Charlie. - Jackson. What are you doing here? - Yeah. - I thought you were toast. - No. Where are the spaceships? There's no way you can make it there. We have a plane. You could come with us, but we gotta leave right now. Fly, birdies. Fly! is this your kid? Where's the goddamn map? - We're going live. - Where is it? Charlie. Focus. Where's the map? Where? It's in the camper. Where in the camper? In the map section on the conspiracy shelf. Dewey decimal system. Between Roswell... ...and Marilyn Monroe. It's starting. You sure you don't wanna come with, man? It's so beautiful. I'm gonna stay. Good luck. This marks the last day of the United States of America. And, by tomorrow, all of mankind. And we will be visible from the Milky Way... ...as a tiny little puff of smoke. I'm watching the earth crumble before my eyes. The giant ash cloud created by this super-volcano... ...will first envelop Vegas... ...and then St. Louis... ...and then Chicago... ...and then, at long last... ...Washington, D.C. will have its lights go out! - That guy's crazy, right, Daddy? - I don't think so. This is ridiculous. Been over half an hour. I tell you, the guy's a nut job. Stop it, Gordon. Noah, hand me the phone again. Daddy, what was that? Nothing. Nothing. I have goose bumps, people. I wish you could see what I'm seeing, people. I wish you could be here with me! Oh, baby. Bring it on! Always remember, folks... ...you heard it first from Charlie! Daddy, it's following us. Don't look! Get on the ground. Get on the ground and hold on. Don't look back. Don't look back. Just look at me. Look at me. Do I look scared? Now, hold on, baby. Hold on tight. Daddy, we're on fire. There it is! There they are. It's them. It's them. It's them. Mommy! Jeez. - No, Daddy. - Hang on, baby. Hang on! No, Daddy! Oh, my Go... - Mommy. - Take her, take her. I'll be right back. - Come here, Lil. Grab my hand. - Come on, Lil. Lilly, you okay? Aliens, Roswell and Marilyn Monroe... Maps! Maps! - Everybody on? Are we ready? - Jackson! - Kate, where is he? What's he doing? - I don't know. No! - Daddy! - No! - Oh, my God. - Kate, we have to go. No. We're not going anywhere. - Kids, buckle up, we're leaving. - This is my dad. We're gonna wait. No! Daddy! Wait! Wait, Gordon, I see something. Dad! It's Daddy! Slow down! Jackson, run! Jackson, take my hand. Jackson. - Dad, hurry! - Run! We're running out of runway. For God's sakes, Kate, pull him up. - Jackson, reach for my hand. - Dad, you can make it, come on. Daddy! All right, buckle in. Here we go! Come on, faster. Faster. Hang on. - Go faster. - I'm trying. Okay. We're good! - We're good. - We're okay. So now that you got your map, where are we going? We're gonna need a bigger plane. No, you just said that, Mom. Yeah, you just said that. You don't remember that you just said that? That's okay. That's okay. Listen, Ma, I am going to call you next week, same time. Okay? You take care now. Take care of yourself. Sir? I think you need to see this. I thought for sure they'd give you an extra ticket, sir. They did. But my mother is almost 89... ...she's in a wheelchair, and she's easily confused. And I am confident that she would want to meet her maker... ...on her own terms, okay? Yes, sir. Who are you bringing? Nobody. Who, my ex-wife? Last thing she said to me... ...she never wanted to see me again. So be it. We need to bring people who can contribute. The South American continent has been ravaged... ...by a series of major earthquakes. The death toll is expected to be well over 2 million people. The devastation in Rio de Janeiro is beyond imagination. Two 8.5 tremors have left the people in the streets... ...desperately fighting for the last remaining resources. In the last hour, we received this video from Globo News, Brazil. Fear and chaos have spread throughout the globe, as in London... ...where the 30th Olympic Games have just been suspended. Hundreds of thousands are marching towards 10 Downing Street... ...demanding a lift of the information blackout. We've had thousands of calls. We had to shut it down. We're receiving reports from all across the globe. Millions upon millions of distraught masses... ...are gathering in public places, converging in desperate prayer. Preachers of many religious denominations... ...have taken their message of the end... ...to the strwets all over the U.S. Repent. There is still time. Kind of galling when you realize that nutbags with their signs had it right. All these people out there, sir... ...shouldn't we be issuing warnings now? Only when the boarding process is complete. That's the plan. - British Columbia, 2010, remember? - Sir. Sir, those plans were drawn up two years ago. Okay. Everybody out. Go on, get out. Mary, get the door. Wasn't it decided that people have the right... ...to fight for their lives best way they can? After we get everyone on board, Adrian. I think that's wrong. Wha...? Just wanna tell everyone they're doomed? There'd be anarchy. - You wanna jeopardize the president? - Come on. Our mission is to assurw the continuity of our species. My question: Can I count on you? Can I? What? The Yellowstone caldera has erupted. The ash cloud will reach Washington in roughly seven hours. We've got to get the government airborne. Where's the president, Sally? Said he wanted some time alone. I think he's over at the chapel. - He's gotta go to church now? - He's praying, sir. Which, under the circumstances, is not such a bad idea. Mr. President. I need to get you on Air Force One immediately. Give me a moment with Adrian. No disrespect, but we simply do not have time. Make time. Did you ever meet my wife, Dorothy? No, sir. I didn't have that honor. She was in and out of it towards the end. The night before she passed on, she took my hand and she told me: ""I think you should have a lottery. Everyone should have a chance to go. "" Maybe that's what we should have done. I'll be the last president of the United States of America. Do you know how that feels, son? No one could have saved the country, sir. And I think... I think people have a right to know. Don't worry, I'll take care of that. Go on now. Not without you, sir. You get on that plane, son. It's a brave new world you're heading to. And a young scientist is gonna be worth 20 old politicians. We should go to my parents' house in the Rockies. This isn't one of your crazy stories. How are we gonna make it to China? Gordon, without Jackson, we wouldn't have made it out of California. Noah, please. You, be careful with the landing gear. Easy, gringo. I know what I doing. Attention. The National Guard has informed us... ...that an extremely hazardous ash cloud... ...is headed for Las Vegas. Hey, where are you going? Everyone move indoors immediately. - Sir, you can't stay here. - I have plane here. It's not safe. Move it! Move it! So you have positive confirmation on this? Thank you, I understand. President's not coming. So... ...the captain doesn't want to abandon his sinking ship. That's his choice. And a noble one. I have also just learned that the vice-president's chopper... ...went down in the ash cloud outside of Pittsburgh. Fortunately, we have protocols to follow. What about the Speaker of the House? - I have no idea. Where is he? - He's the commander in chief now, sir. This is one flight he shouldn't have been late for. - Tell the captain we're taking off. - You don't have the authority. Who's got authority? You've got the authority? You couldn't even keep your mouth shut. You betrayed top-secret information last year. - What are you talking about? - You told your father... ...put this plan in jeopardy. Good thing for you the old man could keep his mouth shut. Oh, come on. Don't look so shocked. We had to monitor everybody. How do you think we kept it a secret? We just killed anybody who tried to talk? Anybody who tried to talk... ...was not just an enemy of the state, they're an enemy of humanity. The director of the Louvre, an enemy of humanity? After he called a press conference he was! Jesus. What did you think? We're all just gonna get on board, hold hands and sing ""Kumbaya""? Sit down and buckle up. Oh, excuse me. is my father in the command center? President's on the line, Dr. Wilson. Thank you. Where are you? You never would have gotten on that plane if I told you. But you said that you'd be... Darling, listen to me. Do you understand how much strength it gives me... ...knowing that you'll survive? The only thing left to do now... ...is tell the truth to people. At least if they know... ...families can say goodbye to each other. A mother can comfort her children. And a father... ...can ask his daughter for forgiveness. Whenever you're ready, Mr. President. My fellow Americans... ...this will be the last time I address you. As you know... ...catastrophe has struck our nation... ...has struck the world. I wish I could tell you... ...we could prevent the coming destruction. We cannot. Today, none of us are strangers. Today... ...we are one family stepping into the darkness together. We are a nation of many religions... ...but I believe these words reflect the spirit of all of our faiths: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall... People! Keep away from the doors and windows. What are we gonna do? Where are we gonna go? Dr. Silberman. - Tamara. - What are you doing here? - Excuse me. - She's a patient, honey. Excuse me, I have a private plane out there. - Karpov! - We need help. - Yuri! - Takeoffs are canceled. - Curtis, you're... - You knew. This whole time you knew. So you've got a way out of here, right? You got a plane? My family, take us with. Please. Please. Boss. Boss. I found us a plane, an Antonov. They were about to take off, but the tower didn't let them. But can you still fly that thing? Sure, boss. But I need copilot. Gordon's a pilot. No, I'm not. I'm not. Yes, he is. Great pilot. Let's go. Good. Let's go! Honey, this is... Jackson, stop saying I'm a pilot. Hey! Hey, stop! You can't go out there. Come back! Move back, people. Get away from the glass! Wow, that's a big plane. It's Russian. - Let's move, everybody. Come on. - Run! - Yeah, let's go, let's go. - Boys, come on. - Gordon, where are you? - Where did you go? I'm up here in the cockpit. Hurry up. Oh, my God. Not again. Whoa, look at these. Las Vegas Auto Show. We had VIP tickets for that. That's fantastic. Let's go. Check the main bus for hydraulics, I'll balance the tanks. What? Okay, okay, okay. I'm trying, okay? I'm trying. Tower to Antonov. What are you doing? Shut down immediately. Caesar. Okay, when I say go, you push all this down at once, okay? - Okay. - Go! Antonov, abort takeoff. You do not have clearance. You must abort. I repeat, you must abort. No! - What the hell was that? - I don't know, but it's not good. - Push. - Pushing. Come on! We're going down! We're going down! Where are the flaps? The flaps are not down. It must be the pumps. Take over. Take over? What do you mean, take over? - Sasha! - Relax! Sit down! God. God. Jesus. - Oh, God. - Okay, I think I got it. - Sasha, now! - Okay, okay. Take a deep breath. Pull! Come on, baby. Lift your big ass for Sasha! - Pull! Pull! - Come on. Mommy. Was that the Eiffel Tower? I think so. Ladies and gentlemen... ...we are on our way to China. Good. That is good, huh? Do not believe in something simply because you have heard it, Nima. But, great Lama, Tenzin is my brother. He works inside the big tunnel, where the ships are built. But what is there in your wisdom, great Lama, if Tenzin is right? What if our world is indeed coming to an end? it is full, great Rinpoche. Like this cup... ...you are full of opinions and speculations. To see the light of wisdom... ...you first must empty your cup. Be careful with the clutch. it tends to slip. - Grandma. - Grandpa, Nima is here! Grandma, I got a message from Tenzin. He wants us to meet him in Cho Ming at the west gate. He says he can get us on the ships he's working on. What are you talking about? Tenzin works on the dam. Grandma... ...the dam is a ship! The government lied to us. There will be a big flood! We must pack up right away. Nima, he gave you the truck? We took a trip on the Laem Song ferry once. Grandpa threw up the whole way. Let's eat first. Hey, look. The new Bentley. Our father had one on order. We were supposed to get it next year. But then he canceled it because of the ships. How many cars does your family have? My mom's boyfriend has a Porsche. Our parents are divorced too. Yeah, but there's nothing we can do about that. Found a hat. She has a thing for hats. I was just like that at her age. They made me feel safe. So how did you meet Dr. Silberman? As you can see, not the same way you did. My boyfriend asked me to get them done. He's not your husband? Oh, no. We are not married. And probably never will. For the boys. They seem to like each other, huh? She is adorable. Yeah, I guess. So tell me, Mr. Karpov, how much did you pay? One billion euro. Per seat. - That's disgusting. - Oh, yeah? You know, Curtis, I wasn't always businessman. I am a boxer. Was my only playing when I was boy back in Murmansk. And my coach, his name was also Yuri. He always said: ""If someone wants to beat you, he has to kill you first. "" That's very nice. Yeah. But tell me, what would you have done if you rich like me? Look. They are wonderful children, huh? Okay, guys. The plan is to refuel in Hawaii, so sit down and buckle up. Gordon and I will do the rwst. Oh, God. Go get the guys. Guys, there's a... You might wanna... What is that? The state of Hawaii. Not good. That is not good. How much fuel do we have left? Not enough. We're going to have to make a water landing... ...somewherw in South China Sea. Great. At least we're not gonna need the landing gear. - What about it? - Oh, we lost it all. in Vegas. Dr. Wilson, may I come in? I'm not very good company, I'm afraid, Dr...? Please, call me Adrian. All those people we left behind... ...they don't stand a chance, do they? I believe that nature will choose for itself from itself... ...what will survive. Just like you preserving those great artworks. Our culture is our soul, and that's not dying tonight. Oh, come on. I contributed to this cover-up. And Da Vinci, Picasso, they're in. But you're some nobody, you don't stand a chance. That's not... That's not necessarily true. You ever hear of a writer called Jackson Curtis? Wrote a book, Farewell Atlantis. What do you think the chances are of an unknown writer... ...who barely sold 500 copies, making it aboard this plane? I don't understand. I mean, call it chance or fate or nature. it doesn't matter. This book is part of our legacy now. Why? Because I'm reading it. Dr. Helmsley, please report to the Situation Room immediately. Hello. I'm sorry. Who is this? This is Yoko Delgatto. Do you wanna speak to my daddy? Yes, please. Who should I say is calling? Tell him it's his father. You're my grandpa? Yes, sweetheart, I am. Daddy, Daddy, Grandpa's on the phone. Mr. President, sir. Mr. President. - What's the matter, sweetie? - She can't find her daddy. Why don't you two get comfy on that couch? Sally, come help them out, okay? I'll find your daddy. Who can help me with missing persons? Sorry, man. I'm really busy right now. I mean... Of course, sir. Sorry, Mr. President. Don't worry about it. You're doing a great job, son. - What? - The capital's been hit by a 9.4. We've lost communication. - Where's it centered? - North Chesapeake Bay. Mr. Anheuser, the Russian president's on the line, sir. Excuse me. We just entered Chinese airspace. That's affirmative, Mr. President. Until communication is restored, I suppose I am in command. it appears that all other heads of state are en route... ...with the exception of the Italian prime minister... ...who has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer. The Earth's crust has begun to shift, Dr. Helmsley. - By what degree? -1.2 degrees, but it's still moving. So, what happens next? Once the movement of our land masses comes to a halt... Let's see a simulation, Scotty. ...expect the formation of gigantic tsunamis... ...proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding quakes. Pull up the Japanese seaboard, will you? Yes, sir. My dad's on a cruise ship out here. But I guess you already knew that, huh? Sir, we recorded two underwater quakes at 7.9 and 8.2. From what we have just learned... ...Tokyo seems to have taken the full force of the earthquake. At this point, unconfirmed reports indicate... ...that large areas of land are underwater. Please stay tuned for further... Tony... I called. I was too late. Maybe they got out in time. You never know. They... Harry! I'm coming home, Dorothy. Anything? Nothing. Just static. Not even an emergency signal. Can't think about what's going on down there. Remember that old Beetle we used to camp in? We could never get the roof up. Yeah. We definitely traded up. Tried to find our old spot at Yellowstone... ...when I went camping with the kids... ...but I couldn't find it. Do you think people change? By ""people,"" do you mean me? Yes. Do you think you've changed since we separated? I certainly eat a lot more cereal now. You always had tunnel vision. You could just block everything out and write. You blocked us out. Do you love him? I love him enough. All global ground communication has ceased, sir. The only signals our satellites are picking up... ...are coming from the vessels in Cho Ming. Well, there's a piece of good news. Any updates, doctor? We expect the tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent. The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours. it looks like the crust has shifted by almost 23 degrees... ...to the southwest. The data also shows the Earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields. These are their new positions. So you're... You're telling me that the North Pole... ...is now somewhere in Wisconsin? Actually, that's the South Pole now. Engine failure. Two of the six are down. We must get ready. - How long do we have? - Fifteen minutes. Maybe. - Better wake up the kids. - Yeah. Why do you hate Gordon? Hey. Come on. What are you talking about? I don't hate him. Well, you don't like him, either. Well, that's just because I don't know him that well, maybe. Yeah, but I do. He's really nice once you get to know him. You should talk to him more often. You guys would get along really, really well. You like him a lot, huh? I'll do my best, I promise. Okay? I'm really proud of you. Really, really proud of you. is it time? Yeah. - Dad, what's wrong? - Well, Sasha said we gotta land... ...and it's gonna be a little bumpy and maybe a little wet. Daddy? Hold her steady. Daddy, I'm not a really good swimmer. Hey, no, that's all right. That's what you got this for. Right? it's like being in a swimming pool, only it's got more cool stuff. Look, it's got a whistle, and a light thing. Right? I thought we were going to China. No, we gotta land here. So we're just all gonna stay together, right? - No, we're not, we're gonna die. - No. We're not. Promise? I promise you we're gonna all stay together... ...no matter what happens, okay? Jackson. Yuri. I think you better come up here. I'm gonna go check this out. - Dad. Where are you going? - I'll be back. - You said you'd stay with us. - We gotta buckle up. Let's go. Okay, don't ask me how that happened... ...but there is no more ocean... ...and we're close to where we wanted to go. it's like the world shifted by 1000 miles. One thousand five hundrwd and seventy-eight to be exact. it's called Earth Crust Displacement Theory. Professor Hapgood, 1958. Way to go, Charlie. What was that? We just lost our last two engines. I'm gonna shoot for that glacier. it's gonna get rocky. Listen, this is gonna sound crazy, but here's what you have to do. Unbuckle. Come on, come on, come on. Yuri! What are we doing? We are taking the Bentley. Not yet. Not yet. it has to be perfect. Almost there. - Come on. - Get in the car. Okay, go. Now. Pull. No, no, no! Go. Go, Jackson. No, we gotta wait for Sasha and Gordon. Go. Make sure everybody gets out of the plane before I touch down. What about you? I'll be fine. I have to touch this baby down. What are you waiting for? Go! Go! There he is. I see him. - Wherw is Sasha? Wherw is Sasha? - Come on. Let's go. He said he's fine. We should get out of here before he touches down. No, no, no. Don't go. We have to wait for him. Go, Jackson. Go. - Don't go! - it won't start. it won't start. Just shut up, everybody! Engine... ...start. Voice control. Sold me on it. Hey! Hey! Welcome to the People's Republic of China. Good to be here. Say hi, kids. - Hi. - Hi. What color are your passes? What color are your boarding passes? I have green card. For my boys and me. What? Yuri. Yuri. Yuri, it's a mistake. A joke, right? What? You think I didn't know about you and Sasha? May God bless that poor bastard's soul. I'm sorry, guys. Good luck. Come on, boys. - Does anybody have any money? - I do, I do. You got a billion euros? Dr. Wilson? I'm Captain Michaels, skipper of the American ship. Please accept my condolences for your father. Thank you, captain. Mr. Anheuser, your party is the last to arrive. There've been reports of severe damage, captain. What's the status of Ark Number 3? We haven't done a complete assessment yet... ...but it looks like we lost it. No toothbrush. Only books. Yeah, when I was a kid, my dad was on the road a lot. He would always leave me a box full of books... ...call me every night and quiz me. I'd get an ice-cream cone for every book I read... ...so I was a fat kid. I find that very hard to believe. No, it's true. My high school career was 2000 books... ...and zero girlfriends. I didn't even kiss a boy till I was in college. They were all too scared of my dad. Leave it to the Chinese. I didn't think it was possible. Not in the time we had. That's Ark Number 3, sir. The roof collapsed on it during the shifting of the Earth's crust. Jesus Christ. Boarding of Ark Number 3 will be delayed due to technical difficulties. - Excuse me. - We paid a fortune! Please be patient as we keep you updated. Hey, what's going on here? I have a green card for my boys and me. I want to speak to a supervisor. I am the supervisor. Get back with the other green cards or I'll have you detained. What he said about you and Sasha, is it true? Sasha was worth 100 times a man like Yuri. I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman. I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it. Did you know he asked me for a discount? And he paid in installments. Cheap bastard. You hear that? Over therw! - Hey! - Hey! - Stop! Stop! Please! - Hey! Hold it! Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop! Help! Hey! How were all these people chosen? Same way your art was: By experts from all over the world. We had geneticists determine the perfect gene pool to repopulate. These people were chosen by geneticists? All green-card holders, please proceed to Gallery D-4. Looks like their checkbooks got them onboard. Right. Without billions of dollars from the private sector... ...this would've been impossible. We sold tickets. And what about all these workers? They all get passes? What, life isn't fair? is that it? You wanna donate your passes to a couple of Chinese workers... ...you be my guest. Captain, I want a prelaunch briefing. All international teams present. What the hell? What is this? You could fit 10 people in here. Satnam, where are you? - On the Nampan Plateau. - What? There's a tidal wave coming from the east. - it's gigantic. - Satnam, what happened? We never got picked up, Adrian. The airlift never came. Goodbye, my friend. Satnam. - The flooding is coming this way? - Mary. Where are we set up? Over therw. Get me the satellite images from Nampan, India. - Okay, right away. - What's happening? No. Satnam was talking about another wave... ...coming from the east. - Holy mother. - The flooding is gonna hit earlier? is that what you're telling me? The second wave is closer? - Plug in the new data. - Okay. - Satnam didn't get picked up. - What? A lot of people didn't get picked up in this chaos. This is not a conspiracy, Helmsley. Your predictions haven't exactly panned out, have they, doctor? it's ready. it's ready. Oh, God. it's 1500 meters high. When's it gonna get here? Talk to me, Helmsley. When's it gonna hit? Adjust the countdown. Twenty-eight minutes, 10 seconds to impact. Oh, my God. Captain, I need to speak to the other heads of state immediately. - Right away. Taylor? - Aye, captain. Standing by. Ark 6, stand by. Ark 7, stand by. - Carl Anheuser, acting CIC, Ark 4. - Yes, sir. Requesting emergency conference, T-99. He thinks the world of you, you know that? He's a great little man. Yeah. I always wanted to have a family of my own. You're a lucky man, Jackson. Don't ever forget it. Who are they? We found them along side of the road. Send them back! I am a follower... ...of our great Lama Rinpoche. You know I cannot do that. What's the problem? You don't have to take all of us. Just take my children. I'm begging you. Why should I do that? The same reason you sent for your family. Please. Just the children. You don't have to take us. Please! Please. Oh, my God. Please. I don't know if you can understand what I'm saying. As a mother, I'm begging you. Please take them. Please. We are all children of the earth. My plan will not work for so many, Grandma. We will take them all. Please. Thank you. Thank you. Attention: All construction workers, off deck. All crew members, onboard now. They're opening the mountain. They are leaving without us. Step back. Get back. What did I tell you? They are leaving you behind too. Look, idiot. Please be patient. Let's go. Follow me. We have to hurry! They are leaving! initiate security procedures. Time to impact: 17 minutes, 42 seconds. Oh, excuse me. Where can I find Adrian Helmsley? He's on the bridge. This way. Tenzin wait! Grandma, we're almost there. Green lights on pressure, Mr. Anton? Green lights across the board, captain. Why do they have anchors? Because they're not spaceships, buddy. They're arks. Let's go. Mr. President. You've got to see this. Stop. Stop! Stop! Stop! Engage the support mechanisms. Aye, aye, captain. Engaging bow-anchor supports. How long are these things expecting to hold us in place? They're just meant to withstand the first impact of the waves. Down there Oleg, you go first! Caesar. Good. Good boy. Come to Mommy. Caesar! Mom, where's Tamara? Daddy look! Come on. Caesar, come on. - Tamara! - I'm coming. Take him. Oh, my God. What's happening out there? Anheuser. Anheuser convinced the other heads of state to launch. Mr. Anheuser. We have to stop this madness. Make sure the other bridges can see me. - What do you think you're doing? - I know what I'm doing. Turn it on. Ladies and gentlemen, this Dr. Adrian Helmsley... ...chief science advisor to the late President Wilson. Could you please turn up the volume, Mr. Hoffmann? We've all been forced to make difficult decisions... ...to save our human civilization. But to be human means to care for each other... ...and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true, then there's nothing human... ...and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Dr. Helmsley's passion is admirable. But I will remind you that we have very limited resources and limited time. Ask yourselves, can we really stand by and watch these people die? I read a quote two days ago. The author is probably dead by now, but he said: ""The moment we stop fighting for each other... ...that's the moment that we lose our humanity. "" To save the human race... ...we have an obligation to stick to this plan... ...which every nation on this flotilla has signed up for. - We have to let these people in! - They're in God's hands now. Officer, you turn that off. That is an order. Turn it off! Don't you dare touch that button. Have you completely lost your mind? Look at the clock. We have barely 15 minutes left. Do you wanna be responsible for the extinction of the human race? Can you handle that, Adrian? There's a young astrophysicist from India... - ... who's the reason we're all here. - Oh, for God's sake. He's the one who discovered it all. He connected all the dots. We all owe him our lives. I just learned that he was killed with his family... ...in a tsunami in eastern India. He was my friend. And he died in vain. Everybody out there has died in vain... ...if we start our future with an act of cruelty. What will you tell your children? What will they tell theirs? If my father were here, he would open the gates. The people of Russia... ...along with China... ...and Japan, agree. Open the gates. The United Kingdom, Spain, France, Canada, Germany... ...and I believe I may also speak for the Italian prime minister... ...we vote to let these people come in. Captain Michaels. Please. This is the captain. in a few moments, we will open the gates... ...and get you people in. Please step back and clear the platform. P- yew, it stinks. - They are opening the gates. - Go. Go. Climb! Don't look down! Climb! Go! Noah. Noah. Get down. Mom. Mom, something happened. Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Gordon, hold on, goddamn it! Give me your hand! - Give me your hand. Reach! - Help! - Reach for it! Gordon! - Please. Please. Please. Gordon! Gordon! Gordon! No! God. Pull me up. Come on! What's wrong with the gate? Looks like it didn't run the full cycle. We're checking, captain. Hold it. Hold it, people. Four minutes to impact. Go to the lower deck. Let's go. - We are loaded, captain. - Well, then let's lock it up. Now. Oleg. Grab my hand. Oleg. No, no. Papa! Papa! Papa! - Something's jamming the hydraulics. - Then get it out, for Chris sake. I can't fire up the engines till we get a good seal on that gate. Captain, we have a breach in the zoological bay. - Can you zoom in? - Yeah. I know those kids. What is happening? What's going on? Where did they come from? There. Through the hydraulic chamber. Captain, I think we found the problem. - Who are these people? - No, wait. He's injured. Something must have gone wrong. Something must have gone wrong? Something must have gone...? Are you kidding me? Of course something went wrong! You know, congratulations to both of you. Might of gotten us killed, but as long as your conscience is clean. Let's get a team down there. I'll meet them at the hydraulics chamber. - You know your way? - Yeah. - Let's go! - One minute to impact. Captain, Cho Ming Airfield's been hit. Put me on emergency com, Mr. Taylor. Aye. You're on, captain. This is the captain speaking. We expect to be impacted by water shortly. - We need to go this way. - All new passengers: - Hit the deck, brace yourselves. - Okay, let's go! Excuse me. Excuse us. Excuse us. Brace yourselves! Coming through, excuse me. All stations, prepare for impact. Come on, boys. Go, go, go! This way! Let's go! Go, go! Collision pressure just below 80 pascal, captain. 0.2 mil surface compression on bow sensors, captain. - All right, track Dr. Helmsley. - There. Come on. - I got you! - Get out of the way! - We have to get through here. - Excuse me. Tenzin, almost there. Nima, what happened? Tamara. Will you take the kids to the stairs, please? - Which way? - We can't get there. Water has penetrated the stern. The rear of the ship is starting to seal itself up one compartment at a time! Wherw's Gordon? No? No. We gotta go back. We gotta go back! We need to go back! - No! Lilly! - Mommy! - Lilly! - Help, Daddy! Run, Lilly! Run! Lilly, run! Go, go! Go over, Lilly. Caesar. Lilly, take him. Mommy! Oh, no. Sir, is there another way to the hydraulics chamber? - Where does this ladder go? - To the zoological bay! Okay, okay, let's go. Professor... ...it's Air Force One. - The mid-ship anchor is hit. - We're destabilizing. The bow anchor's giving in. Captain, the turbine's not responding. So override it. Hit the override button and start the engines. We can't start the engine until we close that gate. Help me! Help! Tamara! - You okay? - My mommy's in there. Help her. We'll get to your mommy. They're doing everything they can. - Can we talk to them? - I'm gonna try and connect us. - We have to stop the bleeding. - Mom, how about my belt? Mr. Curtis! Jackson! Hey! Help! Hey! it's Adrian Helmsley. We met at Yellowstone. That's great! Open the goddamn door! Your daughter is with me! - Lilly! - Lilly! - Where's Noah? - I'm right here, Lil. impact warning. Thirty degrees west. Forty-five degrees east. Target elevation, 29,035 feet. Twenty-nine thousand feet? What the hell is at 29,000 feet? We're headed straight for the north face... ...of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser. And if we can't start our engines, we will not survive the impact. Jackson, you're sealed off. We can't get to you! There's something blocking the hydraulics. If you can't get it out, none of us are gonna make it. Dr. Helmsley, look at this. it is completely submerged down there. There'd be no way to get any air. - There's no other way. - But it's a suicide mission, sir. I know where it is, I'll give it a try. - Dad. Wait, I wanna go with you. - No, Noah. - Dad. I wanna help you. - No, no. You are helping me, buddy. Dad, please. Remember when Lilly was born... ...and you wanted to be introduced as her big brother? Well, she's scared now, and she needs you more than ever. And if you're safe... ...I know that she's safe. Do you understand? You can help me out the next time. Come on. Kate, we caused this thing, it was us. - Gotta go check it out. - Okay. I love you. Please! Can you hear me? Help! Press down. Press down with your hand. Don't stop. Keep pressing. Noah! Distance to impact: 1850 meters. There he is! Captain, we have a visual! - I think we found the problem. - Show us the hydraulic chamber! Goddamn it, I told you to stay up there with Mom. I just wanted to help. All right, all right. You hold the light... ...but from right here, right in the air pocket, okay? You're a crazy little dude. Grandma, Grandpa. I'm sorry. - I could not save us. - He has gone back in. He will fix it. There's no way. Don't lose your faith, brother. Dad! No, we lost him. We're gonna die. We're gonna die. Great job. You light the way, I'll go for the cable. Okay. Distance to impact: 400 meters. Underwater ridge ahead. We're going to run aground, captain. Yeah! - Sir, the gate is sealed. - That's affirmative, captain. Anton, start the engine. Aye, aye, captain. Full reverse. - Too fast! We're not gonna make it. - Distance to impact: 50 meters. Forty meters. Reverse motion activated. Distance to impact: 10 meters. Twenty meters. Yes! - Hard to port. - Aye, captain. Hard to port. We did it. We did it. We did it. - Where's your dad? - He was right behind me. Any word from the hydraulic chamber? Where is he? I thought you said he was behind you. - He was. - Are you sure? Yeah. He was right there. Dad. Come on, Jackson. Come on. Please, God. Please, please. Please, please, please. Come on, Jackson. Oh, my... - He did it! - Daddy! - He did it! - He did it. ""Shuttle Atlantis. Our last day. All we can hear is the sound of our own breathing... ...that reminds us we are still sharing our memories, hopes and ideas. And isn't it funny, just this morning, we worked it out: Somehow or another, we all have relatives in Wisconsin. The end. "" it's good. I thought you'd like it. Tell me, Dr. Wilson... ...apart from books and art... ...do you think there's anything else we might possibly share in the future? Are you asking me out on a date, Dr. Helmsley? Because, you know, my diary is pretty full. Actually... ...yes, I was. Dr. Helmsley to the bridge, please. Dr. Helmsley to the bridge. Come herw. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Michaels speaking. in a few minutes I will give orders to unseal the decks. - Come on. - At 2345 last night... ...our sister arks, Numbers 6 and 7, have joined our course. For the first time on ourjourney... ...we'll have clear skies and moderate-to-good air quality. As you know, our passenger count is way over capacity. So please be careful when you step out. And of course, enjoy the fresh air. Can I hold him? Sure. He can be your dog too, if you like. Thanks. - Where have you been all my life? - Gift shop. Oh, Adrian, excellent. I called because we just got our first satellite feed. The equalization of the oceanic seabeds... ...has not turned out to be as extreme as we expected. The waters are receding much faster than we thought, thank God. And this is hard to believe... ...but the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world. it's now the Drakensberg mountains of KwaZulu-Natal. The entire African continent has risen. Several thousand feet, and it likely never even flooded. That's why they call it the Cape of Good Hope. We've already set course for it. Daddy, when will we go back home? Well, we talked about that. We're gonna find a new home out here somewhere, right? I mean, wherever we're all together, that's home. Right? Don't be scared. I'm not. No more Pull-Ups. Nice., This is a story of an ordinary little boy... ...named Charlie Bucket. He was not faster or stronger or more clever than other children. His family was not rich or powerful or well-connected. In fact, they barely had enough to eat. Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy in the entire world. He just didn't know it yet. - Evening, Buckets. - Evening. Hi, Dad. Soup's almost ready, darling. Don't suppose there's anything extra to put in, love. Oh, well. Nothing goes better with cabbage than cabbage. Charlie... ...I found something I think you'll like. Charlie's father worked at the local toothpaste factory. The hours were long, and the pay was terrible... ...yet occasionally, there were unexpected surprises. It's exactly what I need. What is it, Charlie? Dad found it, just the piece I needed. - What piece was it? - A head for Willy Wonka. Well, how wonderful. It's quite a likeness. You think so? - Think so? I know so. I saw Willy Wonka with my own two eyes. - I used to work for him, you know. - You did? - I did. - He did. He did. I love grapes. Of course, I was a much younger man in those days. Willy Wonka began with a single store on Cherry Street. But the whole world wanted his candy. - Mr. Wonka. - Yeah? We need more Wonka bars... ...and we're out of chocolate birds. - Birds? Birds. Well, then we'll need to make some more. Here. Now open. The man was a genius. Did you know he invented a new way of making chocolate ice cream... ...so that it stays cold for hours without a freezer? You can even leave it lying in the sun on a hot day, and it won't go runny. - But that's impossible. - But Willy Wonka did it. Before long... ...he decided to build a proper chocolate factory. The largest chocolate factory in history. Fifty times as big as any other. Grandpa, don't make it gross. Tell him about the Indian prince. He'd like to hear about that. You mean, Prince Pondicherry? Well, Prince Pondicherry wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka... ...and asked him to come all the way out to India... ...and build him a colossal palace entirely out of chocolate. It will have 100 rooms... ...and everything will be made of dark or light chocolate. True to his word, the bricks were chocolate... ...and the cement holding them together was chocolate. All the walls and ceilings were made of chocolate as well. So were the carpets and the pictures and the furniture. It is perfect in every way. Yeah, but it won't last long. You better start eating right now. Oh, nonsense. I will not eat my palace. I intend to live in it. But Mr. Wonka was right, of course. Soon after this, there came a very hot day with a boiling sun. Mmm. The prince sent an urgent telegram requesting a new palace... ...but Willy Wonka was facing problems of his own. All the other chocolate makers, you see, had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka. They began sending in spies to steal his secret recipes. Fickelgruber started making an ice cream that would never melt. Prodnose came out with a chewing gum that never lost its flavor. Then Slugworth began making candy balloons... ...that you could blow up to incredible sizes. The thievery got so bad... ...that one day, without warning... ...Mr. Wonka told every single one of his workers to go home. He announced that he was closing his chocolate factory forever. I'm closing my chocolate factory forever. I'm sorry. But it didn't close forever. It's open right now. Ah, yes, sometimes when grownups say ""forever,"" they mean ""a very long time. "" Such as, ""I feel like I've eaten nothing but cabbage soup forever. "" - Now, Pops. - The factory did close, Charlie. And it seemed like it was going to be closed forever. Then one day we saw smoke rising from the chimneys. - The factory was back in business. - Did you get your job back? No. No one did. But there must be people working there. Think about it, Charlie. Have you ever seen a single person... ...going into that factory or coming out of it? No. The gates are always closed. Exactly. But then, who's running the machines? - Nobody knows, Charlie. - It certainly is a mystery. Hasn't someone asked Mr. Wonka? Nobody sees him anymore. He never comes out. The only thing that comes out of that place is the candy... ...already packed and addressed. I'd give anything in the world just to go in one more time... ...and see what's become of that amazing factory. Well, you won't, because you can't. No one can. It's a mystery, and it will always be a mystery. That little factory of yours, Charlie, is as close as any of us is ever going to get. Come on, Charlie. I think it's time we let your grandparents get some sleep. - Good night, Grandpa George. - Night, Charlie. - Night-night. Chair. Thank you, dear. Night, Grandpa Joe. Good night, Grandma Georgina. Nothing's impossible, Charlie. - Good night. Night, Charlie. Sleep well. Indeed, that very night... ...the impossible had already been set in motion. Dear people of the world... ...I, Willy Wonka... ...have decided to allow five children to visit my factory this year. In addition, one of these children shall receive a special prize... ...beyond anything you could ever imagine. Five golden tickets have been hidden... ...underneath the ordinary wrapping paper of five ordinary Wonka bars. The bars may be anywhere... ...in any shop, in any street, in any town, in any country in the world. Wouldn't it be something, Charlie, to open a bar of candy... ...and find a golden ticket inside? I know, but I only get one bar a year, for my birthday. Well, it's your birthday next week. You have as much chance as anybody does. Balderdash. The kids who are going to find the golden tickets... ...are the ones who can afford to buy candy bars every day. Our Charlie gets only one a year. He doesn't have a chance. Everyone has a chance, Charlie. Mark my words, the kid who finds the first ticket... ...will be fat, fat, fat. Augustus. This way. I am eating the Wonka bar... ...and I taste something that is not chocolate... ...or coconut... ...or walnut or peanut butter... ...or nougat... ...or butter brittle or caramel or sprinkles. So I look... ...and I find the golden ticket. Augustus, how did you celebrate? I eat more candy. We knew Augustus would find the golden ticket. He eats so many candy bars a day... ...that it was not possible for him not to find one. Yes, it is good, Augustus. - Golden ticket claimed and four more... Told you it'd be a porker. What a repulsive boy. Only four golden tickets left. Now that they've found one, things will really get crazy. - Of every shape, size and hue. Veruca. Can you spell that for us, please? V- E-R-U-C-A. Veruca Salt. As soon as little Veruca told me she had to have one of these golden tickets... ...I started buying all the Wonka bars I could lay my hands on. Thousands of them. Hundreds of thousands. I'm in the nut business, you see. So I say to my workers: Morning, ladies. From now on, you can stop shelling peanuts... ...and start shelling the wrappers off these chocolate bars instead. Three days went by, and we had no luck. Oh, it was terrible. My Veruca got more and more upset each day. Where's my golden ticket? I want my golden ticket. Well, gentlemen, I just hated to see my little girl feeling unhappy like that. I vowed I would keep searching until I could give her what she wanted. And finally, I found her a ticket. Daddy, I want another pony. She's even worse than the fat boy. I don't think that was really fair. She didn't find the ticket herself. Don't worry about it, Charlie. That man spoils his daughter. And no good ever comes from spoiling a child like that. Charlie, Mum and I thought... ...maybe you wanna open your birthday present tonight. Here you are. Maybe I should wait till morning. - Like hell. - Pop. All together, we're 381 years old. We don't wait. Now, Charlie, you mustn't feel too disappointed... ...you know, if you don't get the... Whatever happens, you'll still have the candy. Ah, well. That's that. - We'll share it. - Oh, no, Charlie. Not your birthday present. It's my candy bar, and I'll do what I want with it. Thank you, darling. Thank you, Charlie. Bless you. All right, let's see who found it. ""The third ticket was found by Miss Violet Beauregarde. "" Hah! Hah! Hyah! These are just some of the 263 trophies and medals my Violet has won. I'm a gum chewer mostly, but when I heard about these ticket things... ...I laid off the gum, switched to candy bars. She's just a driven young woman. I don't know where she gets it. I'm the Junior World Champion Gum Chewer. This piece of gum I'm chewing right now... ...I've been working on for three months solid. That's a record. Of course, I did have my share of trophies, mostly baton. So it says that one kid's gonna get this special prize, better than all the rest. I don't care who those other four are. That kid, it's gonna be me. Tell them why, Violet. Because I'm a winner. What a beastly girl. Despicable. You don't know what we're talking about. Dragonflies? But wait, this is just in. The fourth golden ticket has been found by a boy called Mike Teavee. All you had to do was track the manufacturing dates... ...offset by weather and the derivative of the Nikkei Index. A retard could figure it out. Most of the time I don't know what he's talking about. You know, kids these days, what with all the technology... Die! Die! Die! Doesn't seem like they stay kids very long. In the end, I only had to buy one candy bar. - And how did it taste? - I don't know. I hate chocolate. It's a good thing you're going to a chocolate factory, you ungrateful little... That question is, who will be the winner of the last gold...? - Dad? - Yes, Charlie? Why aren't you at work? Oh, well, the toothpaste factory thought they'd give me a bit of time off. Like summer vacation? Sure. Something like that. In fact, it wasn't like a vacation at all. The upswing in candy sales had led to a rise in cavities... ...which led to a rise in toothpaste sales. With the extra money, the factory had decided to modernize... ...eliminating Mr. Bucket's job. We were barely making ends meet as it was. You'll find another job. Until then, I'll just... Well, I'll just thin down the soup a little more. Don't worry, Mr. Bucket, our luck will change. I know it. Charlie. My secret hoard. You and I are going to have one more fling... ...at finding that last ticket. You sure you want to spend your money on that? Of course I'm sure. Here. Run down to the nearest store... ...and buy the first Wonka candy bar you see. Bring it straight back, and we'll open it together. Such a good boy, really. Such a good... Grandpa? - You fell asleep. - Have you got it? Which end should we open first? Just do it quick, like a Band-Aid. Did you see that some kid in Russia found the last golden ticket? Yes, it was in the paper this morning. Good boy. Come on, George. Good boy. One Wonka Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight, please. Okay. Here you go. The nerve of some people. I know. Forging a ticket. Come on. It's a golden ticket. You found Wonka's last golden ticket. In my shop too! Listen. I'll buy it from you. I'll give you $50 and a new bicycle. Are you crazy? I'd give him $500 for that ticket. You wanna sell me your ticket for $500, young man? That's enough of that. Leave the kid alone. Listen. Don't let anyone have it. Take it straight home, you understand? Thank you. Mom! Dad! I found it! The last golden ticket! It's mine! Yippee! Here. Read it aloud. Let's hear exactly what it says. ""Greetings to you, the lucky finder of this golden ticket, from Mr. Willy Wonka. I shake you warmly by the hand. For now, I invite you to my factory... ...and be my guest for one whole day. "" ""I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you around the factory myself... ...showing you everything there is to see. "" ""Afterwards, when it is time to leave... ...you will be escorted home by a procession of large trucks... ...each one filled with all the chocolate you could ever eat. "" ""And remember, one of you lucky five children will receive an extra prize... ...beyond your wildest imagination. Now, here are your instructions. "" ""On the 1 st of February, you must come to the factory gates at 10 a. m. Sharp. You're allowed to bring one member of your family to look after you. Until then, Willy Wonka. "" The 1 st of February. - But that's tomorrow. - Then there's not a moment to lose. Wash your face, comb your hair, scrub your hands... ...brush your teeth, blow your nose. And get that mud off your pants. We must all try and keep very calm. First thing that we have to decide is this: Who is going with Charlie to the factory? I will. I'll take him. You leave it to me. How about you, dear? Don't you think you ought to go? Well, Grandpa Joe seems to know more about it than we do, and... Provided, of course, he feels well enough. Yippee! No. We're not going. A woman offered me $500 for the ticket. I bet someone else would pay more. We need the money more than we need the chocolate. Young man, come here. There's plenty of money out there. They print more every day. But this ticket... ...there's only five of them in the whole world... ...and that's all there's ever going to be. Only a dummy would give this up for something as common as money. Are you a dummy? No, sir. Then get that mud off your pants. You've got a factory to go to. Daddy, I want to go in. It's 9:59, sweetheart. Make time go faster. Do you think Mr. Wonka will recognize you? Hard to say. It's been years. Eyes on the prize, Violet. Eyes on the prize. Please enter. Come forward. Close the gates. Dear visitors... ...it is my great pleasure to welcome you to my humble factory. And who am I? Well... Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka The amazing chocolatier Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka Everybody give a cheer! Hooray! He's modest, clever and so smart He barely can restrain it With so much generosity There is no way to contain it! To contain it To contain, to contain, to contain! Hooray! Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka He's the one that you're about to meet Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka He's the genius who just can't be beat The magician and the chocolate wiz The best darn guy who ever lived Willy Wonka, here he is! The amazing chocolatier Wasn't that just magnificent? I was worried it was getting dodgy in the middle part, but then that finale... Wow! Who are you? - He's Willy Wonka. - Really? ""Good morning, starshine. The Earth says hello. "" ""Dear guests, greetings. Welcome to the factory. I shake you warmly by the hand. My name is Willy Wonka. "" Then shouldn't you be up there? I couldn't very well watch the show from up there, now, could I, little girl? Mr. Wonka, I don't know if you'll remember me... ...but I used to work here in the factory. Were you one of those despicable spies who tried to steal... ...my life's work and sell it to parasitic, copycat, candy-making cads? No, sir. Then wonderful. Welcome back. Let's get a move on, kids. Don't you want to know our names? Can't imagine how it would matter. Come quickly. Far too much to see. Just drop your coats anywhere. - Mr. Wonka? Sure is toasty in here. - What? Oh, I have to keep it warm. My workers are used to an extremely hot climate. They just can't stand the cold. Who are the workers? All in good time. Now... Mr. Wonka, I'm Violet Beauregarde. Oh. - I don't care. - Well, you should care. Because I'm gonna win the special prize at the end. Well, you do seem confident, and confidence is key. I'm Veruca Salt. It's very nice to meet you, sir. I always thought a verruca was a type of wart you got... ...on the bottom of your foot. I am Augustus Gloop. I love your chocolate. I can see that. So do I. I never expected to have so much in common. You. You're Mike Teavee. You're the little devil who cracked the system. And you. Well, you're just lucky to be here, aren't you? And the rest of you must be their... - Parents. - Yeah. Moms and dads. Dad? Papa? Okay, then. Let's move along. Is it just me or does Wonka seem a few quarters short of a buck? I'm sorry, I don't speak American. - Would you like some chocolate? - Sure. Then you should've brought some. - Let's be friends. - Best friends. An important room, this. - After all, it is a chocolate factory. - Then why is the door so small? That's to keep all the great big chocolatey flavor inside. Now, do be careful, my dear children. Don't lose your heads. Don't get overexcited. Just keep very calm. It's beautiful. What? Oh, yeah, it's very beautiful. Every drop of the river... ...is hot, melted chocolate of the finest quality. The waterfall is most important. Mixes the chocolate. Churns it up. Makes it light and frothy. By the way... ...no other factory in the world mixes its chocolate by waterfall, my dear children. And you can take that to the bank. People. Those pipes... ...suck up the chocolate and carry it away all over the factory. Thousands of gallons an hour. Yeah. And do you like my meadow? Try some of my grass. Please have a blade. Please do. It's so delectable and so darn good-looking. You can eat the grass? Of course you can. Everything in this room is eatable. Even I'm eatable. But that is called cannibalism, my dear children... ...and is, in fact, frowned upon in most societies. Yeah. Enjoy. Go on. Scoot, scoot. Son. Please. Dad, he said, ""Enjoy. "" Why hold on to it? Why not start a new piece? Because then I wouldn't be a champion. I'd be a loser, like you. Daddy, look over there. What is it? It's a little person. Over there, by the waterfall. - There's two of them. - There's more than two. - Where do they come from? - Who are they? Are they real people? Of course they're real people. They're Oompa-Loompas. - Oompa-Loompas? - Imported, direct from Loompaland. - There's no such place. - What? Mr. Wonka, I teach high-school geography, and I'm here to tell you... Well, then you'll know all about it, and, oh, what a terrible country it is. The whole place is nothing but thick jungles... ...infested by the most dangerous beasts in the entire world. Hornswogglers and snozzwangers and those terrible, wicked whangdoodles. I went to Loompaland looking for exotic new flavors for candy. Instead... ...I found the Oompa-Loompas. They lived in tree houses to escape from the fierce creatures who lived below. The Oompa-Loompas ate nothing but green caterpillars, which tasted revolting. The Oompa-Loompas looked for things... ...to mash up with the caterpillars to make them taste better: Red beetles, the bark of the bong-bong tree. All of them beastly... ...but not quite so beastly as the caterpillars. Mmm. But the food they longed for the most was the cocoa bean. An Oompa-Loompa was lucky if he found three or four cocoa beans a year. But, oh, how they craved them. All they'd ever think about was cocoa beans. The cocoa bean is the thing from which chocolate is made, so I told the chief: They are such wonderful workers. I feel I must warn you, though, they are rather mischievous. Always making jokes. Augustus, my child, that is not a good thing you do! Hey, little boy. My chocolate must be untouched by human hands. Ah! He'll drown. He can't swim. Save him! Augustus! No! Augustus! Augustus, watch out! Ah! There he goes. - Ah! - Call the fire brigade! It's a wonder how that pipe is big enough. It isn't big enough. He's slowing down. He's gonna stick. I think he has. He's blocked the whole pipe. Look. The Oompa-Loompas. Back off, you little freaks! What are they doing? They're going to treat us to a little song. It is quite a special occasion. They haven't had a fresh audience in many a moon. Augustus Gloop, Augustus Gloop The great big, greedy nincompoop Augustus Gloop, so big and vile So greedy, foul and infantile ""Come on!"" we cried ""The time is ripe To send him shooting up the pipe!"" But don't, dear children, be alarmed Augustus Gloop will not be harmed Augustus Gloop will not be harmed Although, of course, we must admit He will be altered quite a bit Slowly, wheels go round and round And cogs begin to grind and pound We'll boil him for a minute more Until we're absolutely sure Then out he comes, by God, by grace A miracle has taken place This greedy brute, this louse's ear Is loved by people everywhere For who could hate or bear a grudge Against a luscious bit of fudge? Ah! Bravo! Well done! Aren't they delightful? Aren't they charming? - I say, that all seemed rather rehearsed. - Like they knew it was gonna happen. Oh, poppycock. Where is my son? Where does that pipe go to? That pipe, it just so happens to lead... ...directly to the room where I make delicious... ...strawberry-flavored, chocolate-coated fudge. He will be made into strawberry-flavored, chocolate-coated fudge. They'll be selling him by the pound all over the world? No. I wouldn't allow it. The taste would be terrible. Can you imagine Augustus-flavored, chocolate-coated Gloop? Ew. No one would buy it. I want you to take Mrs. Gloop up to the Fudge Room, okay? Help her find her son. Take a long stick and start poking around in the big chocolate-mixing barrel, okay? - Mr. Wonka? - Huh? Why would Augustus' name already be in the Oompa-Loompa song, unless...? Improvisation is a parlor trick. Anyone can do it. You, little girl. Say something. - Anything. - Chewing gum. Chewing gum is really gross Chewing gum, I hate the most See? Exactly the same. No, it isn't. Uh, you really shouldn't mumble. Because I can't understand a word you're saying. Now, on with the tour. - Are the Oompa-Loompas really joking? - Of course they're joking. That boy will be fine. What's so funny? I think it's from all those doggone cocoa beans. Hey, by the way, did you guys know that chocolate contains a property... ...that triggers the release of endorphins? Gives one the feeling of being in love. You don't say. All aboard. Onward! Here. Try some of this. It'll do you good. You look starved to death. - It's great. - That's because it's mixed by waterfall. The waterfall is most important. Mixes the chocolate, churns it up, makes it light and frothy. - No other factory in the world... - You already said that. - You're all quite short, aren't you? - Well, yeah. We're children. Well, that's no excuse. I was never as short as you. - You were once. - Was not. Know why? Because I distinctly remember putting a hat on top of my head. Look at your short, little arms. You could never reach. Do you even remember what it was like being a kid? Oh, boy, do I. Do I? In fact, Willy Wonka... ...hadn't thought about his childhood for years. Trick or treat! Trick or treat! Trick or treat! Who do we have here? Ruthie, Veronica, Terrance. And who's that under the sheet? Little Willy Wonka. Willy Wonka was the son of the city's most famous dentist... ...Wilbur Wonka. Now... ...let's see what the damage is this year, shall we? Caramels. They'd get stuck in your braces, wouldn't they? Lollipops. Ought to be called ""cavities on a stick. "" Then we have all this... All this... ...chocolate. You know, just last week, I was reading in a very important medical journal... ...that some children are allergic to chocolate. Makes their noses itch. Maybe I'm not allergic. - I could try a piece. - Really? But why take a chance? Mr. Wonka? Mr. Wonka? - We're headed for a tunnel. - Oh, yeah. Full speed ahead. - How can they see where they're going? - They can't. There's no knowing where they're going. Switch on the lights! People, keep an eye out. We're passing some very important rooms here. What do you use hair cream for? To lock in moisture. - Whipped cream. - Precisely. That doesn't make sense. For your information, little girl... ...whipped cream isn't whipped cream at all unless it's been whipped with whips. Everybody knows that. Stop the boat. I wanna show you guys something. Now, this is the most important room in the entire factory. Now, everyone, enjoy yourselves, but just don't touch anything. Okay? Go on. Go on, scoot. Hey, Mr. Wonka, what's this? Oh. Let me show you. Thank you. These are Everlasting Gobstoppers. They're for children who are given very little allowance. You can suck on it all year, and it'll never get any smaller. - Isn't that neat? - It's like gum. No. Gum is for chewing. If you tried chewing one of these Gobstoppers... ...you'd break all your little teeth off. But they sure do taste terrific. And this is Hair Toffee. You suck down one of these little boogers... ...and in exactly half an hour... ...a brand-new crop of hair will grow out over the top of your little noggin. And a mustache. And a beard. - Who wants a beard? - Well... ...beatniks, for one. Folk singers and motorbike riders. You know, all those hip, jazzy, super-cool, neat, keen and groovy cats. It's in the fridge, daddy-o. Are you hep to the jive? Can you dig what I'm laying down? I knew you could. Slide me some skin, soul brother. Unfortunately, the mixture isn't right yet. Because an Oompa-Loompa tried some yesterday, and, well, he... How are you today? You look great. Watch this. You mean that's it? Do you even know what ""it"" is? - It's gum. - Yeah. It's a stick of the most amazing and sensational gum in the whole universe. Know why? Know why? Because this gum is a full three-course dinner all by itself. Why would anyone want that? ""It will be the end of all kitchens and all cooking. Just a little strip of Wonka's magic chewing gum and that is all you will... ...ever need at breakfast, lunch and dinner. This piece of gum happens to be tomato soup, roast beef and blueberry pie. "" It sounds great. - It sounds weird. - It sounds like my kind of gum. I'd rather you didn't. There are still some things that are... I'm the world-record holder in chewing gum. I'm not afraid of anything. - How is it, honey? - It's amazing! Tomato soup. I can feel it running down my throat. Yeah. Spit it out. - Young lady, I think you'd better... - It's changing. Roast beef, with baked potato. - Crispy skin and butter. - Keep chewing. My little girl's gonna be the first person to have a chewing-gum meal. Yeah. I'm just a little concerned about the... Blueberry pie and ice cream! - That part. - What's happening to her nose? It's turning blue. Your whole nose has gone purple. What do you mean? Violet, you're turning violet. - What's happening? - I told you I hadn't quite got it right. Because it goes a little funny when it gets to the dessert. It's the blueberry pie that does it. I'm terribly sorry. Mother? What's happening to me? She's swelling up. Like a blueberry. I've tried it on, like, 20 Oompa-Loompas, and each one ended up as a blueberry. It's just weird. But I can't have a blueberry as a daughter. How is she supposed to compete? You could put her in a county fair. Yeah, yeah Yeah Listen close, and listen hard To the tale of Violet Beauregarde This gentle girl She sees no wrong In chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing Chewing, chewing all day long Yeah She goes on chewing till, at last Her chewing muscles grow so vast And from her face Her giant chin Sticks out just like a violin Chewing, chewing all day long Chewing, chewing all day long For years and years she chews away Her jaws get stronger every day And with one great, tremendous chew They bite the poor girl's tongue in two And that is why we try so hard To save Miss Violet Beauregarde Chewing, chewing all day long Chewing, chewing all day long Chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing Chewing, chewing all day long Mr. Wonka! I want you to roll Miss Beauregarde into the boat... ...and take her along to the Juicing Room at once, okay? Juicing Room? What are they gonna do to her there? They're gonna squeeze her. Like a little pimple. We gotta squeeze all that juice out of her immediately. Mother, help me. Please. Come on. Let's boogie. Without the boat, we'll have to move double-time to keep on schedule. There's too much to see. - Mr. Wonka? - Yeah? Why did you decide to let people in? So they could see the factory, of course. But why now? And why only five? What's the special prize, and who gets it? The best kind of prize is a surprise. Will Violet always be a blueberry? No. Maybe. I don't know. That's what you get from chewing gum all day. It's disgusting. If you hate gum so much, why do you make it? Once again, you shouldn't mumble. It's starting to bum me out. Can you remember the first candy you ever ate? No. In fact, Willy Wonka did remember... ...the first candy he ever ate. I'm sorry, I was having a flashback. I see. These flashbacks happen often? Increasingly... ...today. Ah, this is a room I know all about. For you see, Mr. Wonka, I, myself, am in the nut business. Are you using the Havermax 4000 to do your sorting? No. You're really weird. - Squirrels. - Yeah. Squirrels. These squirrels are specially trained to get the nuts out of shells. Why use squirrels? Why not use Oompa-Loompas? Because only squirrels can get the whole walnut out almost every single time. See how they tap them with their knuckles to make sure it's not bad? Oh, look. Look. I think that one's got a bad nut. Daddy, I want a squirrel. Get me one of those squirrels. I want one. Veruca, dear, you have many marvelous pets. All I've got at home is one pony and two dogs and four cats and six rabbits... ...and two parakeets and three canaries and a green parrot and a turtle... ...and a silly old hamster. I want a squirrel! All right, pet. Daddy will get you a squirrel as soon as he possibly can. But I don't want any old squirrel, I want a trained squirrel. Very well. Mr. Wonka, how much do you want for one of these squirrels? Name your price. Oh, they're not for sale. She can't have one. Daddy. I'm sorry, darling. Mr. Wonka's being unreasonable. If you won't get me a squirrel, I'll get one myself. Veruca. Little girl? Veruca, come back here at once. Veruca. Little girl? Don't touch that squirrel's nuts. It'll make him crazy. I'll have you. Veruca. Veruca. No! Veruca! Let's find the key. Nope. Not that one. - Daddy! - Veruca! No. It's not that one. There it is. There it isn't. Daddy, I want them to stop. What are they doing? They're testing to see if she's a bad nut. Oh, my goodness. She is a bad nut after all. Veruca! Daddy! Where are they taking her? Where all the other bad nuts go. To the garbage chute. - Where does the chute go? - To the incinerator. But don't worry. We only light it on Tuesdays. Today is Tuesday. There's always the chance they decided not to light it today. - Ah! - Ah! Now, she may be stuck in the chute just below the top. If that's the case, all you have to do is just reach in and pull her out. Okay? Veruca Salt, the little brute Has just gone down the garbage chute And she will meet, as she descends A rather different set of friends A fish head, for example, cut This morning from a halibut An oyster from an oyster stew A steak that no one else would chew And lots of other things as well Each with its rather horrid smell Horrid smell These are Veruca's newfound friends That she will meet as she descends These are Veruca's newfound friends Who went and spoiled her, who indeed? Who pandered to her every need? Who turned her into such a brat? Who are the culprits? Who did that? The guilty ones, now this is sad Are dear old Mum and loving Dad Ah! Oh, really? Oh, good. I've just been informed that the incinerator's broken. So there should be about three weeks of rotten garbage to break their fall. Well, that's good news. Yeah. Well, let's keep on trucking. I don't know why I didn't think of this earlier. The elevator's by far the most efficient way to get around the factory. There can't be this many floors. How do you know, Mr. Smarty-Pants? This isn't an ordinary up-and-down elevator, by the way. This elevator can go sideways, longways, slantways... ...and any other ways you can think of. You just press any button and, whoosh, you're off. Oh, look. Look. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Fudge Mountain. Oh. I'd rather not talk about this one. This is the Puppet Hospital and Burn Center. It's relatively new. Ah, the administration offices. Hello, Doris. Why is everything here completely pointless? Candy doesn't have to have a point. That's why it's candy. It's stupid. Candy is a waste of time. No son of mine is going to be a chocolatier. Then I'll run away. To Switzerland. Bavaria. The candy capitals of the world. Go ahead. But I won't be here when you come back. Sorry, son. We're closing for the night. I wanna pick a room. Go ahead. Here. Put these on quick, and don't take them off whatever you do. This light could burn your eyeballs right out of your skulls. And we certainly don't want that, now, do we? This is the testing room for my very latest and greatest invention: Television Chocolate. One day it occurred to me: ""Hey, if television can break up a photograph... ...into millions and millions of tiny pieces and send it whizzing through the air... ...then reassemble it on the other end... ...why can't I do the same with chocolate? Why can't I send a real bar of chocolate... ...through the television, all ready to be eaten?"" I'm not gonna touch it. I'm not going in that direction. Sounds impossible. It is impossible. You don't understand anything about science. First off, there's a difference between waves and particles. Duh. Second, the amount of power it would take to convert energy in matter... ...would be like nine atomic bombs. Mumbler! Seriously, I cannot understand a single word you're saying. Okey-dokey. I shall now send a bar of chocolate from one end of the room... ...to the other by television. Bring in the chocolate. It's gotta be real big because you know how on TV... ...you can film a regular-size man, and he comes out looking this tall? Same basic principle. It's gone. Told you. That chocolate is now rushing through the air above our heads... ...in a million tiny little pieces. Come over here. Come on. Come on. Come on! Watch the screen. Here it comes. Oh, look. - Take it. - It's just a picture on a screen. Scaredy-cat. You take it. Go on. Just reach out and grab it. Go on. Holy buckets. Eat it. Go on. It'll be delicious. It's the same bar. It's just gotten a little smaller on the journey, that's all. It's great. It's a miracle. So imagine, you're sitting at home watching television... ...and suddenly a commercial will flash onto the screen, and a voice will say: ""Wonka's chocolates are the best in the world. If you don't believe us, try one for yourself. "" And you simply reach out and take it. How about that? So can you send other things? Say, like, breakfast cereal? Do you have any idea what breakfast cereal's made of? It's those little curly wooden shavings you find in pencil sharpeners. But could you send it by TV if you wanted to? - Of course I could. - What about people? Well, why would I wanna send a person? They don't taste very good at all. Don't you realize what you've invented? It's a teleporter. It's the most important invention in the history of the world. And all you think about is chocolate. Calm down, Mike. I think Mr. Wonka knows what he's talking about. No, he doesn't. He has no idea. You think he's a genius, but he's an idiot. But I'm not. Hey, little boy. Don't push my button. He's gone. Let's go check the television, see what we get. I sure hope no part of him gets left behind. What do you mean? Well, sometimes only half of the little pieces find their way through. If you had to choose only one half of your son, which one would it be? What kind of a question is that? No need to snap. Just a question. Try every channel. I'm starting to feel a little anxious. - There he is. - Mike. The most important thing That we've ever learned The most important thing we've learned As far as children are concerned Is never, never let them near The television set Or better still just don't install The idiotic thing at all Never, never let them Never, never let them Never, never let them It rots the senses in the head It keeps imagination dead It clogs and clutters up the mind It makes a child so dull and blind So dull, so dull He can no longer understand A fairy tale, a fairyland A fairyland, a fairyland His brain becomes as soft as cheese His thinking powers rust and freeze He cannot think, he only sees Regarding little Mike Teavee We very much regret that we Regret that we Shall simply have to wait and see Wait and see, wait and see Wait and see, wait and see, wait and see We very much regret that we Shall simply have to wait and see If we can get him back his height But if we can't It serves him right Ew, somebody grab him. Help me. Help me. Oh, thank heavens. He's completely unharmed. Unharmed? What are you talking about? Just put me back in the other way. There is no other way. It's television, not telephone. There's quite a difference. And what exactly do you propose to do about it? I don't know. But young men are extremely springy. They stretch like mad. - Let's go put him in the taffy puller. - Taffy puller? Hey, that was my idea. Boy, is he gonna be skinny. Yeah. Taffy puller. I want you to take Mr. Teavee and his... ...little boy up to the taffy puller, okay? Stretch him out. On with the tour. There's still so much left to see. Now, how many children are left? Mr. Wonka, Charlie's the only one left now. You mean, you're the only one? Yes. What happened to the others? Oh, my dear boy, but that means you've won. Oh, I do congratulate you. I really do. I'm absolutely delighted. I had a hunch right from the beginning. Well done. Now, we mustn't dilly or dally. We have an enormous number of things to do before the day's out. But luckily for us, we have the great glass elevator to speed things along... Speed things along. Come on. ""Up and Out""? What kind of room is that? Hold on. Oh, my goodness. We're gonna need to go much faster, otherwise we'll just never break through. Break through what? I've been longing to press that button for years. Well, here we go. Up and out. - But do you really mean...? - Yeah. I do. But it's made of glass. It'll smash into a million pieces. Augustus, please don't eat your fingers. But I taste so good. Look, Mother. I'm much more flexible now. Yes, but you're blue. Daddy, I want a flying glass elevator. Veruca, the only thing you're getting today is a bath, and that's final. But I want it. Where do you live? Right over there. That little house. What time do you think they'll be back? Hard to know, dear. I think there's someone at the door. Hi, Mom. Mom. Dad. We're back. Charlie. Charlie. Goodness. This is Willy Wonka. He gave us a ride home. I see that. You must be the boy's... - Parents? - Yeah. That. He says Charlie's won something. Not just some something. The most ""something"" something of any something that's ever been. I'm gonna give this little boy my entire factory. You must be joking. No, really. It's true. Because you see, a few months ago, I was having my semiannual haircut... ...and I had the strangest revelation. In that one silver hair... ...I saw reflected my life's work... ...my factory, my beloved Oompa-Loompas. Who would watch over them after I was gone? I realized in that moment: I must find a heir. And I did, Charlie. You. That's why you sent out the golden tickets. Uh-huh. What are Oompa-Loompas? I invited five children to the factory... ...and the one who was the least rotten would be the winner. That's you, Charlie. So, what do you say? Are you ready to leave all this behind and come live with me at the factory? Sure. Of course. I mean, it's all right if my family come too? Oh, my dear boy, of course they can't. You can't run a chocolate factory... ...with a family hanging over you like an old, dead goose. No offense. None taken, jerk. A chocolatier has to run free and solo. He has to follow his dreams. Gosh darn the consequences. Look at me. I had no family, and I'm a giant success. So if I go with you to the factory, I won't ever see my family again? Yeah. Consider that a bonus. Then I'm not going. I wouldn't give up my family for anything. Not for all the chocolate in the world. Oh, I see. That's weird. There's other candy too besides chocolate. I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka. I'm staying here. Wow. Well, that's just... ...unexpected... ...and weird. But I suppose, in that case, I'll just... Goodbye, then. Sure you won't change your mind? I'm sure. Okay. Bye. Things are going to get much better. And for once, Grandma Georgina... ...knew exactly what she was talking about. The next morning, Charlie helped his parents fix the hole in the roof. Grandpa Joe spent the whole day out of bed. He didn't feel tired at all. Charlie's father got a better job at the toothpaste factory... ...repairing the machine that had replaced him. Things had never been better for the Bucket family. The same could not be said for Willy Wonka. I can't put my finger on it. Candy's the only thing I was ever certain of... ...and now I'm just not certain at all. I don't know which flavors to make or which ideas to try. I'm second-guessing myself, which is nuts. I've always made whatever candy I felt like, and I... That's just it, isn't it? I make the candy I feel like, but now I feel terrible, so the candy's terrible. You're very good. Pity about that chocolate fellow, Wendell... Walter. - Willy Wonka. - That's the one. Says here in the paper his new candies aren't selling very well. But I suppose maybe he's just a rotten egg who deserves it. - Yep. - Oh, really? You ever met him? I did. I thought he was great at first, but then he didn't turn out so nice. He also has a funny haircut. I do not! - Why are you here? - I don't feel so hot. What makes you feel better when you feel terrible? My family. Ew. What do you have against my family? It's not just your family. It's the whole idea of... They tell you what to do, what not to do... ...and it's not conducive to a creative atmosphere. Usually they're just trying to protect you because they love you. If you don't believe me, you should ask. Ask who? My father? No way. At least, not by myself. You want me to go with you? Hey. Hey, what a good idea. Yeah! And you know what? I've got transport... I have to be more careful where I park this thing. I think we've got the wrong house. Do you have an appointment? No. But he's overdue. Open. Now, let's see what the damage is, shall we? Heavens. I haven't seen bicuspids like these since... Since... Willy? Hi, Dad. All these years... ...and you haven't flossed. Not once. It was on this day... ...that Willy Wonka repeated his offer to Charlie... ...who accepted on one condition. Sorry we're late. We were brainstorming. Thought I heard thunder. - You staying for dinner, Willy? - Yes, please. I'll shuffle the plates. You smell like peanuts. - I love peanuts. - Oh, thank you. You smell like... ...old people and soap. I like it. Elbows off the table, Charlie. How do you feel about little raspberry kites? With licorice instead of string. - Boys, no business at the dinner table. - Sorry, Mom. I think you're on to something, though, Charlie. In the end Charlie Bucket won a chocolate factory. But Willy Wonka got something even better: A family. And one thing was absolutely certain: Life had never been sweeter.,  Once upon a time in a kingdom far, far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. And throughout the land, everyone was happy... until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss... of the handsome Prince Charming.  It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon's keep.  For he was the bravest, and most handsome... in all the land. And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse. He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess's chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her...  What? - Princess... Fiona? - No!  Oh, thank heavens. Where is she? - She's on her honeymoon. - Honeymoon? With whom? - She's on her honeymoon. - Honeymoon? With whom?  So she said what's the problem, baby? What's the problem? I don't know Well, maybe I'm in love Think about it every time I think 'bout it Can't stop thinking 'bout it How much longer will it take to cure this? Just to cure it, 'cause I can't ignore it If it's love, love Makes me wanna turn around and face me But I don't know nothing 'bout love Oh, come on, come on -  -  Turn a little faster Come on, come on The world will follow after Come on, come on Everybody's after love So I said I'm a snowball running Running down into this spring that's coming all this love Melting under blue skies belting out sunlight Shimmering love Well, baby, I surrender To the strawberry ice cream Never ever end of all this love Well, I didn't mean to do it But there's no escaping your love These lines of lightning mean we're never alone Never alone, no, no Come on, come on Jump a little higher Come on, come on If you feel a little lighter Come on, come on We were once upon a time in love Hyah! We're accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love I'm in love, I'm in love Accidentally in love I'm in love I'm in love It's so good to be home! -  -  Just you and me and...  - Two can be as bad as one... - Donkey? Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two a sight for sore eyes! Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine.  And look at you, Mrs. Shrek. How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed? Donkey, what are you doing here? Taking care of your love nest for you. Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail and watering the plants? - Yeah, and feeding the fish! - I don't have any fish. You do now. I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona. That Shrek is a rascally devil. Get your... Look at the time. I guess you'd better be going. Don't you want to tell me about your trip? Or how about a game of Parcheesi? Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be getting home to Dragon? Oh, yeah, that. I don't know. She's been all moody and stuff lately. I thought I'd move in with you. You know we're always happy to see you, Donkey. But Fiona and I are married now. We need a little time, you know, to be together. Just with each other. Alone. Say no more. You don't have to worry about a thing. I will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you. - Donkey! - Yes, roomie? You're bothering me. Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess... Me and Pinocchio was going to catch a tournament, anyway, so... Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday for a barbecue or something. He'll be fine. Now, where were we?  Oh. I think I remember. - Donkey! -  I know, I know! Alone! I'm going! I'm going. What do you want me to tell these other guys?   Enough, Reggie.  ""Dearest Princess Fiona. ""You are hereby summoned to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away ""for a royal ball in celebration of your marriage ""at which time the King ""will bestow his royal blessing... upon you and your..."" uh... ""Prince Charming. ""Love, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away. ""aka Mom and Dad."" Mom and Dad? - Prince Charming? - Royal ball? Can I come? - We're not going. -  What? I mean, don't you think they might be a bit... shocked to see you like this?  Well, they might be a bit surprised. But they're my parents, Shrek. They love me. And don't worry. They'll love you, too. Yeah, right. Somehow I don't think I'll be welcome at the country club. Stop it. They're not like that. How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band? Oh, come on! You could at least give them a chance. To do what? Sharpen their pitchforks? No! They just want to give you their blessing. Oh, great. Now I need their blessing? If you want to be a part of this family, yes! Who says I want to be part of this family? You did! When you married me! Well, there's some fine print for you!  So that's it. You won't come? Trust me. It's a bad idea. We are not going! And that's final! Come on! We don't want to hit traffic!  Don't worry! We'll take care of everything.  - Hey, wait for me. Oof! -    Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up! Rawhide! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Rawhide! Ride 'em up! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide! Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead! Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks! Meet their mamas! Milk 'em hard! Rawhide! Yee-haw! -  Are we there yet? -  No. -  Are we there yet? -  Not yet. -  OK, are we there yet? -  No. -  Are we there yet? -  No! -  Are we there yet? -  Yes. - Really? - No! - Are we there yet? -  No! - Are we there yet? -  We are not! - Are we there yet? -  No! - Are we there yet? -  - That's not funny. That's really immature. -  - This is why nobody likes ogres. -  - Your loss! -  - I'm gonna just stop talking. - Finally! This is taking forever, Shrek. There's no in-flight movie or nothing! The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey. That's where we're going. Far, far...  away! All right, all right, I get it. I'm just so darn bored. Well, find a way to entertain yourself.     -  -  For five minutes... Could you not be yourself...  ...for five minutes! -  -  Are we there yet? -  Yes! - Oh, finally!   Wow! It's going to be champagne wishes and caviar dreams from now on. Hey, good-looking! We'll be back to pick you up later! Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me We are definitely not in the swamp anymore.  Halt! Well, I talk about it, talk about it, talk about it, talk about it Hey, everyone, look. Talk about, talk about movin'... Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh? You working that hat.  Swimming pools! Movie stars!    Announcing the long-awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband. Well, this is it. - This is it. - This is it. This is it.      Uh... why don't you guys go ahead? I'll park the car.  So... you still think this was a good idea? Of course! Look. Mom and Dad look happy to see us. -  Who on earth are they? -  I think that's our little girl. That's not little! That's a really big problem. Wasn't she supposed to kiss Prince Charming and break the spell? Well, he's no Prince Charming, but they do look...  Happy now? We came. We saw them. Now let's go before they light the torches. - They're my parents. - Hello? They locked you in a tower. That was for my own... Good! Here's our chance. Let's go back inside and pretend we're not home. Harold, we have to be... Quick! While they're not looking we can make a run for it. Shrek, stop it! Everything's gonna be... A disaster! There is no way... - You can do this. - I really... - Really... - don't... want... to... be... Here! Mom... Dad... I'd like you to meet my husband... Shrek. Well, um... It's easy to see where Fiona gets her good looks from.    - Excuse me. -  Better out than in, I always say, eh, Fiona?   That's good. I guess not. What do you mean, ""not on the list""? Don't tell me you don't know who I am. What do you mean, ""not on the list""? Don't tell me you don't know who I am. What's happening, everybody? Thanks for waiting. - I had the hardest time finding this place. - No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down! No, Dad! It's all right. It's all right. He's with us. - He helped rescue me from the dragon. - That's me: the noble steed. Waiter! How 'bout a bowl for the steed? Oh, boy.  - Um, Shrek? - Yeah? Oh, sorry! Great soup, Mrs Q. Mmm! No, no. Darling.  Oh! So, Fiona, tell us about where you live. Well... Shrek owns his own land. - Don't you, honey? - Oh, yes! It's in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and...  What? I know you ain't talking about the swamp. An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original. I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children. -  -  It's a bit early to be thinking about that, isn't it? - Indeed. I just started eating. - Harold! - What's that supposed to mean? - Dad. It's great, OK? - For his type, yes. - My type? I got to go to the bathroom. - Dinner is served! - Never mind. I can hold it. Bon appetit! Oh, Mexican food! My favorite. Let's not sit here with our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in. Don't mind if I do, Lillian. I suppose any grandchildren I could expect from you would be... Ogres, yes! Not that there's anything wrong with that. Right, Harold? Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is, assuming you don't eat your own young! Dad! No, we usually prefer the ones who've been locked away in a tower! - Shrek, please! - I only did that because I love her. Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle. You wouldn't understand. You're not her father! It's so nice to have the family together for dinner. - Harold! - Shrek! - Fiona! - Fiona! - Mom! - Harold... Donkey!  Your fallen tears have called to me So, here comes my sweet remedy I know what every princess needs For her to live life happily...  Oh, my dear. Oh, look at you.

Nip and tuck, here and there To land that prince with the perfect hair Stop!  Look... Thank you very much, Fairy Godmother, but I really don't need all this.  - Fine. Be that way. - We didn't like you, anyway. -  -  Fiona? Fiona?  Oh! You got a puppy? All I got in my room was shampoo. Oh, uh... Fairy Godmother, furniture...  I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek. Your husband? What? What did you say? When did this happen? Shrek is the one who rescued me. - But that can't be right. - Oh, great, more relatives! She's just trying to help. Good! She can help us pack. Get your coat, dear. We're leaving. - What? - I don't want to leave. When did you decide this? - Shortly after arriving. - Look, I'm sorry... No, that's all right. I need to go, anyway. But remember, dear. If you should ever need me... happiness... is just a teardrop away. Thanks, but we've got all the happiness we need. Happy, happy, happy...  So I see. Let's go, Kyle. - Very nice, Shrek. - What? I told you coming here was a bad idea. You could've at least tried to get along with my father. I don't think I was going to get Daddy's blessing, even if I did want it. Do you think it might be nice if somebody asked me what I wanted? Sure. Do you want me to pack for you? You're unbelievable! You're behaving like a... - Go on! Say it! - Like an ogre! Here's a news flash for you! Whether your parents like it or not... I am an ogre! -  -  And guess what, Princess? That's not about to change. I've made changes for you, Shrek. Think about that. That's real smooth, Shrek. ""I'm an ogre!""   I knew this would happen.  You should. You started it. I can hardly believe that, Lillian. He's the ogre. Not me. I think, Harold, you're taking this a little too personally. This is Fiona's choice. But she was supposed to choose the prince we picked for her. I mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this... thing? Fiona does. And she'll never forgive you if you don't. I don't want to lose our daughter again, Harold. Oh, you act as if love is totally predictable. Don't you remember when we were young? We used to walk down by the lily pond and... - they were in bloom... - Our first kiss. It's not the same! I don't think you realize that our daughter has married a monster! Oh, stop being such a drama king. Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong! La, di, da, di, da! Isn't it all wonderful! I'd like to know how it could get any worse! - Hello, Harold. -  - What happened? - Nothing, dear! Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit!  I'll just stretch it out here for a while. You better get in. We need to talk. Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed.  Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy. So, how about... we make this a quick visit. What? Oh, hello. Ha-ha-ha! So, what's new? You remember my son, Prince Charming? Is that you? My gosh! It's been years. When did you get back? Oh, about five minutes ago, actually. After I endured blistering winds, scorching desert... I climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower... Mommy can handle this. He endures blistering winds and scorching desert! He climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower... And what does he find? Some gender-confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married. It wasn't my fault. He didn't get there in time. Stop the car!  Harold. You force me to do something I really don't want to do.  Where are we? Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy! May I take your order? My diet is ruined! I hope you're happy. Er... okay. Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili rings... - I'll have the Medieval Meal. - One Medieval Meal and, Harold... - Curly fries? - No, thank you. - Sourdough soft taco, then? - No, really, I'm fine. Your order, Fairy Godmother. This comes with the Medieval Meal. There you are, dear. We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don't want me to go back on my part.  Indeed not. So, Fiona and Charming will be together. - Yes. - Believe me, Harold. It's what's best. Not only for your daughter... but for your Kingdom. What am I supposed to do about it? Use your imagination.   Oh... Come on in, Your Majesty.  I like my town With a little drop of poison Nobody knows...   Excuse me. Do I know you? No, you must be mistaking me for someone else. Uh... excuse me. I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister. Ah! There you are. Right. You see, I need to have someone taken care of. - Who's the guy? - Well, he's not a guy, per se. Um... He's an ogre.  Hey, buddy, let me clue you in. There's only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly... he don't like to be disturbed. he don't like to be disturbed. Where could I find him?  Hello? Who dares enter my room? Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but I'm told you're the one to talk to about an ogre problem? You are told correct. But for this, I charge a great deal of money. Would... this be enough? You have engaged my valuable services, Your Majesty. Just tell me where I can find this ogre.    Everyone says I'm getting down too low Everyone says you've just gotta let it go You just gotta let it go I need some sleep Time to put the old horse down I'm in too deep And the wheels keep spinning round Everyone says you've just gotta let it go Everyone says you've just gotta let it go Dear Knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.  Dear Diary... Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can't go. He never lets me out after sunset. Dad says I'm going away for a while. Must be like some finishing school. Mom says that when I'm old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family, and we'll all live happily ever after. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming.  Mrs. Fiona Charming.  Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, no. I was just reading a, uh... a scary book. I was hoping you'd let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier. - Okay... - I don't know what came over me. Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over... - Look, Your Majesty, I just... - Please. Call me Dad. Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other. Excellent idea! I was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt. A little father-son time? I know it would mean the world to Fiona.  Shall we say, 7:30 by the old oak?   Face it, Donkey! We're lost. We can't be lost. We followed the King's instructions exactly. ""Head to the darkest part of the woods..."" ""Past the sinister trees with scary-looking branches."" - The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey! - We passed that three times already! You were the one who said not to stop for directions. Oh, great. My one chance to fix things up with Fiona's dad and I end up lost in the woods with you! Don't get huffy! I'm only trying to help. I know! I know. - I'm sorry, all right? - Hey, don't worry about it. I just really need to make things work with this guy. Yeah, sure. Now let's go bond with Daddy.   Well, well, well, Donkey. I know it was kind of a tender moment back there, but the purring? What? I ain't purring. Sure. What's next? A hug? Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr. What do you think I am, some kind of a... Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare!  Look! A little cat. - Look out, Shrek! He got a piece! - It's a cat, Donkey. Come here, little kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty. Come here. Oh! Come here, little kitty. -  - Whoa! - Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming! - Come on! Get it off! Get it off! Oh, God. Oh... No! - Look out, Shrek! Hold still! - Get it off! Shrek! Hold still! - Did I miss? - No. You got them. Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from... Puss... in Boots! I'll kill that cat! Ah-ha-ha!     -  Hairball. - Oh! That is nasty! What should we do with him? Take the sword and neuter him. Give him the Bob Barker treatment. Oh, no! Por favor! Please! I implore you! It was nothing personal, Seor. I was doing it only for my family. My mother, she is sick. And my father lives off the garbage! The King offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Fiona's father paid you to do this? The rich King? S.  Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing. Don't feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you. Gee, thanks. Maybe Fiona would've been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming. That's what the King said. Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question was directed at me. Shrek, Fiona knows you'd do anything for her. Well, it's not like I wouldn't change if I could. I just... I just wish I could make her happy. Hold the phone... ""Happiness."" ""A tear drop away."" Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that's ever happened to you! Aw, man, where do I begin? First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans. Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me. Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going ""Piata!!"" What is a piata, anyway? No, Donkey! I need you to cry! Don't go projecting on me. I know you're feeling bad, but you got to... Aaaahhh! You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of... What? Is it on? Is it on?  This is Fairy Godmother. I'm either away from my desk or with a client. But if you come by the office, we'll be glad to make you an appointment. Have a ""happy ever after. "" Oh... Are you up for a little quest, Donkey? That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure! Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo! We're on the move! - Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you. - Join the club. We've got jackets. On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine. The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken. Let's go, Shrek. Shrek? - Shrek! - Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him... in his wee little boots. You know, how many cats can wear boots? Honestly. - Let's keep him! - Say what?  Ahh! Listen. He's purring! - Oh, so now it's cute. - Come on, Donkey. Lighten up. Lighten up? I should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! Lighten up? I should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up!  Shrek!   Shrek? They're both festive, aren't they? What do you think, Harold? Um... Yes, yes. Fine. Fine.  Try to at least pretend you're interested in your daughter's wedding ball. Honestly, Lillian, I don't think it matters. How do we know there will even be a ball? Mom. Dad. - Oh, hello, dear. - What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming. Mom, have you seen Shrek? I haven't. You should ask your father. Be sure and use small words, dear. He's a little slow this morning. - Can I help you, Your Majesty? - Ah, yes! Um... Mmm! Exquisite. What do you call this dish? That would be the dog's breakfast, Your Majesty. Ah, yes. Very good, then. Carry on, Cedric. - Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek? - No, I haven't, dear. I'm sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in. You know, after your little spat last night. Oh. You heard that, huh? The whole kingdom heard you. I mean, after all, it is in his nature to be... well, a bit of a brute. Him? You know, you didn't exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon. Well, what did you expect? Look at what he's done to you. Shrek loves me for who I am. I would think you'd be happy for me. Darling, I'm just thinking about what's best for you. Maybe you should do the same.  No, really?   Shh... Oh...  Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place. Let's back away slowly. That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage. She's the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom. Then why don't we pop in there for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!   He makes me laugh. Hi. I'm here to see the... The Fairy Godmother. I'm sorry. She is not in. Jerome! Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!  Yes, Fairy Godmother. Right away. Look, she's not seeing any clients today, OK? That's OK, buddy. We're from the union. The union? We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign. Oh! Oh, right. Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed? Uh... a little. We don't even have dental. They don't even have dental. Okay, we'll just have a look around. Oh. By the way. I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother didn't know we were here. - Know what I'm saying? Huh? - Huh? Huh? Huh? - Stop it. - Of course. Go right in.   A drop of desire.  Naughty! A pinch of passion.  And just a hint of... lust!  -  Excuse me. -  Sorry to barge in like this... What in Grimm's name are you doing here? Well, it seems that Fiona's not exactly happy. Oh-ho-ho! And there's some question as to why that is? Well, let's explore that, shall we? Ah. P, P, P... Princess. Cinderella. Here we are. ""Lived happily ever after."" Oh...  No ogres! Let's see. Snow White. A handsome prince. Oh, no ogres. Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres! Hansel and Gretel? No! Thumbelina? No. The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman... No, no, no, no, no! You see, ogres don't live happily ever after. All right, look, lady! Don't you point... those dirty green sausages at me! Your Monte Cristo and coffee. Oh! Sorry. Ah... that's okay. We were just leaving. Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother. Just... go. Come on, guys.  TGIF, eh, buddy? Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac? Get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face! Man, that stinks! You don't exactly smell like a basket of roses. - Well, one of these has got to help. - I was just concocting this very plan! Already our minds are becoming one. Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on licking ourselves, we'll give you a call. Shrek, this is a bad idea. Look. Make yourself useful and go keep watch. Puss, do you think you could get to those on top? No problema, boss. In one of my nine lives, I was the great cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Shrek, are you off your nut? Donkey, keep watch. Keep watch? Yeah, I'll keep watch. I'll watch that wicked witch come and whammy a world of hurt up your backside. I'll laugh, too. I'll be giggling to myself. - What do you see? - Toad Stool Softener? I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems. - Elfa Seltzer? - Uh-uh. - Hex Lax? - No! Try ""handsome."" Sorry. No handsome. Hey! How about ""Happily Ever After""? Well, what does it do? It says ""Beauty Divine."" In some cultures, donkeys are revered as the wisest of creatures. Especially us talking ones.  Donkey! That'll have to do. We've got company. Can we get on with this? Hurry! Nice catch, Donkey! Finally! A good use for your mouth.  Come on! You spurn my natural emotions You make me feel like dirt and I'm hurt And if I start a commotion I run the risk of losing you and that's worse Ever fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love In love with someone, ever fallen in love In love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with Ever fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love In love with someone, ever fallen in love With someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with Fallen in love with Ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with I don't care whose fault it is. Just get this place cleaned up! And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate! - Mother! - Charming. Sweetheart. This isn't a good time, pumpkin. Mama's working. Whoa, what happened here? - The ogre, that's what! - What? Where is he, Mom? l shall rend his head from his shoulders! I will smite him where he stands! He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me! Oh, put it away, Junior! You're still going to be king. We'll just have to come up with something smarter. Pardon. Um... Everything is accounted for, Fairy Godmother, except for one potion. What? Oh... I do believe we can make this work to our advantage. ""Happily Ever After Potion. Maximum strength. ""For you and your true love. ""If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine. ""Happiness, comfort and beauty divine."" - You both will be fine? - I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too. Hey, man, this don't feel right. My donkey senses are tingling all over. Drop that jug o' voodoo and let's get out of here. It says, ""Beauty Divine."" How bad can it be?  See, you're allergic to that stuff. You'll have a reaction. And if you think that I'll be smearing Vapor Rub over your chest, think again! Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion... allow me to take the first sip. It would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you. Oh, no, no. I don't think so. If there'll be any animal testing, I'll do it. That's the best friend's job. Now give me that bottle. How do you feel? I don't feel any different. I look any different? You still look like an ass to me. Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys. - Well, here's to us, Fiona. - Shrek? - You drink that, there's no going back. - I know. - No more wallowing in the mud? - I know. - No more itchy butt crack? - I know! - But you love being an ogre! - I know! But I love Fiona more. Shrek, no! Wait!   Got to be... I think you grabbed the ""Farty Ever After"" potion. Maybe it's a dud. Or maybe Fiona and l were never meant to be. Or maybe Fiona and l were never meant to be.  Uh-oh. What did I tell you? I feel something coming on. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die! Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy. I'm melting! I'm melting! It's just the rain, Donkey.  Oh. Don't worry. Things seem bad because it's dark and rainy and Fiona's father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you.  It'll be better in the morning. You'll see... The sun'll come out... Tomorrow  Bet your bottom... Bet my bottom? I'm coming, Elizabeth! Donkey? Are you all right? - Hey, boss. Let's shave him. - D-Donkey?   There you are! We missed you at dinner. What is it, darling? Dad... I've been thinking about what you said. And I'm going to set things right. Ah! Excellent! That's my girl. It was a mistake to bring Shrek here. I'm going to go out and find him. And then we'll go back to the swamp where we belong.  Fiona, please! Let's not be rash, darling. You can't go anywhere right now.   Fiona! Look, I told you he was here. Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.  Good morning, sleepyhead.   Good morning! We love your kitty! -  Oh... My head... - Here, I fetched a pail of water. Thanks. Uhh! Aahh! Oh... A cute button nose? Thick, wavy locks? Taut, round buttocks? I'm... I'm... - Gorgeous! - I'll say. I'm Jill. What's your name? - Um... Shrek. - Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe? - You're tense. - I want to rub his shoulders. - I got it covered. - I don't have anything to rub. Get in line. Get in line. - Have you seen my donkey? - Who are you calling donkey? - Donkey? You're a... - A stallion, baby! I can whinny.  I can count. Look at me, Shrek! I'm trotting! That's some quality potion. What's in that stuff? ""Oh, don't take the potion, Mr. Boss, it's very bad."" Pah! ""Warning: Side effects may include burning, itching, oozing, weeping. ""Not intended for heart patients or those with... nervous disorders."" I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place! Yeah! What? Seor? ""To make the effects of this potion permanent, ""the drinker must obtain his true love's kiss by midnight."" Midnight? Why is it always midnight? - Pick me! I'll be your true love! - I'll be your true love. I'll be true... enough. Look, ladies, I already have a true love.  Oh... And take it from me, Boss. You are going to have one satisfied Princess. And let's face it. You are a lot easier on the eyes. Inside you're the same old mean, salty... - Easy. - ...cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been. And you're still the same annoying donkey. - Yeah. -  Well... Look out, Princess. Here comes the new me. First things first. - We need to get you out of those clothes. -  - Ready? - Ready! -  - Driver, stop! Oh, God! Help me, please! My racing days are over! I'm blind! Tell the truth. Will I ever play the violin again? You poor creature! Is there anything I can do for you? Well, I guess there is one thing. Take off the powdered wig and step away from your drawers. - Not bad. - Not bad at all.  Father? Is everything all right, Father? Thank you, gentlemen! Someday, I will repay you. Unless, of course, I can't find you or if I forget. -  -    Oh, yeah Turn and face the strange Ch-Ch-Changes Don't wanna be a richer one Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes Turn and face the strange Ch-Ch-Changes Just gonna have to be a different man Time may change me But I can't trace time Halt! Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir Shrek, is here to see her. Still don't know what I was looking for And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets Every time I thought I'd got it made It seemed the taste was not so sweet -  -  Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes Turn and face the strange - Shrek? -  Ch-Ch-Changes Don't wanna be a richer one Time may change me But I can't trace time Fiona? Hello, handsome. Shrek! - Princess! - Donkey? Wow! That potion worked on you, too? What potion? Shrek and I took some magic potion. And well... Now, we're sexy! Shrek?  For you, baby... I could be. - Yeah, you wish. - Donkey, where is Shrek? He went inside looking for you. Shrek? Fiona! Fiona! You want to dance, pretty boy? Are you going so soon? Don't you want to see your wife? Fiona? Shrek? Aye, Fiona. It is me. What happened to your voice? The potion changed a lot of things, Fiona. But not the way I feel about you. Fiona? - Charming? - Do you think so?  Dad. I was so hoping you'd approve. - Um... Who are you? - Mom, it's me, Shrek. I know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think?  Fiona! Fiona! Fiona! - Fiona! - Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho! Oh, shoot! I don't think they can hear us, pigeon.  Don't you think you've already messed her life up enough? I just wanted her to be happy. And now she can be. Oh, sweetheart. She's finally found the prince of her dreams. But look at me. Look what I've done for her. It's time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek. She's a princess, and you're an ogre. That's something no amount of potion will ever change. But... I love her. If you really love her... you'll let her go.   Shrek? Seor. What's going on? Where are you going? You wouldn't have had anything to do with this, would you, Harold? People just ain't no good I think that's well understood There you go, boys. Just leave the bottle, Doris. Hey. Why the long face? It was all just a stupid mistake. I never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place. I hate Mondays. I can't believe you'd walk away from the best thing that happened to you. What choice do I have? She loves that pretty boy, Prince Charming. Come on. Is he really that good-looking? Are you kidding? He's gorgeous! He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels. - Oh. He sounds dreamy. - You know... shockingly, this isn't making me feel any better. Look, guys. It's for the best. Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she's always dreamed of. Everybody wins. Except for you. I don't get it, Shrek. You love Fiona. Aye. And that's why I have to let her go. Excuse me, is she here? She's, uh... in the back. Oh, hello again. Fairy Godmother. Charming. You'd better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold. Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really... warming up to Prince Charming. - FYI, not my fault. - No, of course it's not, dear. I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend I'm that dreadful ogre? No, no, it's nobody's fault. Perhaps it's best if we just call the whole thing off, okay? -  What? - You can't force someone to fall in love! I beg to differ. I do it all the time! Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming. - Umm... no. - What did you say? I can't. I won't do it. Oh, yes, you will. If you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after. And I can take it away just as easily. Is that what you want? Is it? - No. - Good boy. Now, we have to go. I need to do Charming's hair before the ball. He's hopeless. He's all high in the front. He can never get to the back. You need someone to do the back. Oh. Thank you, Mother.  Mother? Um... Mary! A talking horse! The ogre! Stop them! Thieves! Bandits! Stop them! (Announcer) The abs are fab and it's gluteus to the maximus here at tonight's Far, Far Away Royal Ball blowout! The coaches are lined up as the cream of the crop pours out of them like Miss Muffet's curds and whey. Everyone who's anyone has turned out to honor Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek. And, oh my, the outfits look gorgeous! Look! Hansel and Gretel! What the heck are the crumbs for? And right behind them, Tom Thumb and Thumbelina! - Oh, aren't they adorable! -   Here comes Sleeping Beauty! Tired old thing. Who's this? Who's this? Who is this? Oh. It's the one, it's the only... It's the Fairy Godmother! Hello, Far, Far Away! Can I get a whoop whoop? May all your endings be happy and... Well, you know the rest! We'll be right back with the Royal Far, Far Away Ball after these messages. I hate these ball shows. They bore me to tears. Flip over to Wheel Of Torture! I'm not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona. Whizzes on you guys. Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing! No, to your left. Your left! - Tonight on ""Knights""... - Now here's a good show! We got a white bronco heading east into the forest. Requesting backup. It's time to teach these madcap mammals their ""devil may mare"" attitudes just won't fly. Why you grabbing me? Police brutality! I have to talk to Princess Fiona! - We warned you! - Ow! Ow! Did someone let the cat out of the bag? You capitalist pig dogs!  - Catnip! - That's not mine. Find Princess Fiona! I'm a donkey! Tell her Shrek... I'm her husband, Shrek! Quick! Rewind it! I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow!  Darling? Ah. I thought I might find you here. How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball? I'm not going. The whole Kingdom's turned out to celebrate your marriage. There's just one problem. That's not my husband. I mean, look at him. Yes, he is a bit different, but people change for the ones they love. You'd be surprised how much I changed for your mother. Change? He's completely lost his mind! Why not come down to the ball and give him another chance? You might find you like this new Shrek. But it's the old one I fell in love with, Dad. I'd give anything to have him back. Darling. That's mine. Decaf. Otherwise I'm up all night. Thanks. I got to get out of here! I got to get out of here! You can't lock us up like this! Let me go! What about my Miranda rights? You're supposed to say I have the right to remain silent. Nobody said I have the right to remain silent! You have the right to remain silent. What you lack is the capacity. I must hold on before I, too, go totally mad. Shrek? Donkey? Too late. Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here! Oh...  Fire in ze hole!  Look out below! Quick! Tell a lie! - What should I say? - Anything, but quick! Say something crazy like ""I'm wearing ladies' underwear!"" I am wearing ladies' underwear. - Are you? - I most certainly am not! It looks like you most certainly am are! - I am not! - What kind? - It's a thong! - Oww! They're briefs! - Are not. - Are too! - Are not! - Are too! Here we go. Hang tight.  Wait, wait, wait! Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey! Ow! - Excuse me? - What? Puss! Pardon me, would you mind letting me go? - Sorry, boss. - Quit messing around! We've got to stop that kiss! I thought you was going to let her go. I was, but I can't let them do this to Fiona. Boom! That's what I like to hear. Look who's coming around! It's impossible! We'll never get in. The castle's guarded. There's a moat and everything! Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick. - What? - Do you still know the Muffin Man? Well, sure! He's down on Drury Lane. Why? Because we're gonna need flour. Lots and lots of flour. Gingy! Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man! We've got a big order to fill!   It's alive!    Run, run, run, as fast you can!  Go, baby, go! There it is, Mongo! To the castle!  No, you great stupid pastry! Come on!   Mongo! Down here! Look at the pony! That's right! Follow the pretty pony! Pretty pony wants to play at the castle!  Pretty pony. Ladies and gentlemen. Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek.  Shrek, what are you doing? I'm just playing the part, Fiona. Is that glitter on your lips? Mm. Cherry flavored. Want to taste? - Ugh! What is with you? - But, Muffin Cake...  C Minor, put it in C Minor. Ladies and gentlemen.  I'd like to dedicate this song to... Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek. Fiona, my Princess. Will you honor me with a dance? Where have all the good men gone And where are all the gods?  Dance! Where's the streetwise Hercules To fight the rising odds? Since when do you dance? Fiona, my dearest, if there's one thing I know, it's that love is full of surprises. Late at night I toss and I turn And I dream of what I need Hit it! I need a hero All right, big fella! Let's crash this party! Man the catapults! Aim! Fire! - Brace yourselves! - Ooh! Purty!  Not the gumdrop button!  Incoming! Ha-ha! All right! Somewhere after midnight In my wildest fantasy Go, Mongo! Go! Man the cauldrons! After you, Mongo. - That's it! Heave-ho! - Watch out! Shrek! More heat, less foam! Up where the mountains Meet the heavens above Out where the lightning Splits the sea I could swear there is someone Somewhere watching me Heave! Ho!  No...!   Come on!  Look out! - Be good. -   He needs me! Let me go! Donkey! Puss! Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go! Today, I repay my debt.  Aww...  On guard! He's gotta be strong And he's gotta be fast And he's gotta be fresh From the fight - I need a hero - Stop!  - Hey, you! Back away from my wife. - Shrek? You couldn't just go back to your swamp and leave well enough alone. - Now! - Pigs und blanket! Pinocchio! Get the wand! I see London! I see France! Whah! I'm a real boy! Ah! Ah! Aaahhh! Catch! Donkey! Oh! I'm a real boy. Aah! Oh! - Ha! - Ah. That's mine! Pray for mercy, from Puss... And Donkey! She's taken the potion! Kiss her now! No! - Hi-ya! -  - Fiona. - Shrek. Harold! You were supposed to give her the potion! Well, I guess I gave her the wrong tea. -  Mommy! - Mommy?  I told you. Ogres don't live happily ever after.  Woo! Ha!   Oh, Dad!  - Is he...? - Yup.  He croaked. Harold? Dad? I'd hoped you'd never see me like this. - And he gave you a hard time! - Donkey! No, no, he's right. I'm sorry. To both of you. I only wanted what was best for Fiona. But I can see now... she already has it. Shrek, Fiona... Will you accept an old frog's apologies... and my blessing? Harold? I'm sorry, Lillian. I just wish I could be the man you deserve. You're more that man today than you ever were... warts and all.    Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion! Midnight! Fiona. Is this what you want? To be this way forever? - What? - Because if you kiss me now... we can stay like this. You'd do that? - For me? - Yes. I want what any princess wants. To live happily ever after... with the ogre I married. Whatever happens, I must not cry! You cannot make me cry!   Whoa! No. No, no. Aaah! Ow. Oh, no.   Hey. You still look like a noble steed to me.  Now, where were we? Oh. I remember.   Hey! Isn't we supposed to be having a fiesta? Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!   Puss and Donkey, y'all... She's into superstitions Black cats and voodoo dolls - Sing it, Puss! -  I feel a premonition That girl's gonna make me fall Here we go! She's into new sensations New kicks in the candlelight She's got a new addiction For every day and night She'll make you take your clothes off And go dancing in the rain She'll make you live her crazy life But she'll take away your pain Like a bullet to your brain Upside inside out Living la vida loca Hey gorgeous!

Boys. Boys. Give a chick a chance.

The song became love... ... and love became the egg. Memphis? - You got it, sugar? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. Safe and warm. Hold it tight, now. Whoa, I think I felt a move in there. And in the usual way... ... the moms left for the fishing season... ... while the dads stayed home to do egg time. You gonna be okay, Daddy? Oh, sure, honey. We'll be waiting for you, right here on Lonely Street. I love you more and more, tell me why Bye-bye, now. Goodbye, Norma Jean. Don't you worry about a thing. Don't wanna let you go I never can say goodbye, boy When all others leave... ...we remain! When the sun vanishes... ...we remain! I'm feelin' so lonely I'm feelin' so lonely... Heed the wisdoms, brothers! Make a huddle! Warm thy egg! Make a huddle! - Share the cold! - Share the cold. Each must take his turn against the icy blast... ...if we are to survive the endless night. Raise your voices, brothers! Give praise to the Great 'Guin... ... who puts songs in our hearts and fish in our bellies! Ain't no particular song I'm more compatible with Oh, baby, I think I wanna dance now. No, no, no. There is a wisdom, brothers and sisters... ... that stands above all others. - Never, ever... - It's okay. ...no matter what... - No harm done. See? ... drop your egg. No, we're cool. We're cool. Of the many thousands who sang through that long night of winter... ... it was Memphis who cried out most fervently... ... to turn the Earth and bring back the sun. - It's a boy! - Hey, it's a girl! - What a peach! - What a bruiser! - Come here, son. - Come to Daddy, there you go. Son, you have made your daddy so proud. It's all genetics, you know. Memphis? Is everything okay? I don't know. I can't hear anything. - Is it empty? - Honey. - Can I have it? - Gloria. It's okay, Maurice. It happens sometimes, Memphis. Yeah. Wait, you hear that? - Yeah. - Hey, I can hear you, buddy. Oh, your papa's here, it's okay. Oh, he's okay, Maurice. Whoa, there it is! That's his little foot there. There's his other one. That's different. Hey! Come back here, Mr. Mumble. Gloria... She can call him whatever the heck she likes. Whoa, little Mumble. - Mumble? Mumble? - You okay? Freezing. Freezing. Oh, you'll get used to it. Come on. Come to your daddy. - What do you make of that? - Little wobbly in the knees. - Is he okay? - I don't know. What you doing there, boy? I'm happy, Pa. What you doing with your feet? They're happy too. - I wouldn't do that around folks, son. - Why not? - Well, it just ain't penguin, okay? - Okay. Yeah. Hey, come on over here. Get under here. Get warm. Watch the beak. Watch the beak... Beak! The beak. Okay, good boy. So late. What's keeping them? Pray, brothers, the Great 'Guin does not test us with a lean season. Why, Noah? Have we not all been dutiful? So when you see your mama... - I stand perfectly still. - You got it. But how will I know which one's my mama? Oh, you'll know. She's got a wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk. And when she sings, it darn near breaks your heart. Hey, wait. I see them. I see them! You're right! You're right! Wives, ho! Wives, ho! Wives, ho! Wait, no. Wait, no, Mumble, get back here. No, Mumble! Get back... Mumble! Mumble! Mumble! Mumble! Michelle? Michelle? - Roxanne? - Michelle? Alfie? - Maurice! - Michelle! Michelle! Mommy! Oh, she's so darling. Excuse me. Pardon me, pardon me. Mumble? Mumble? Oh, Mumble. - Mama? - Mumble! - Mama? - Mumble! Mumble! Mama? Mama? - Mumble, boy, where are you? - Mama! Memphis? Oh, Mama. Oh, Mama. - Oh, my. - Daddy. So where's the baby? Well, honey, I'll find him. - You lost the baby? Memphis! - It's okay. - Mama? Mama? - Stay! - Come to Mommy. - No, Mumble. Mama, Mama. Hey, what's wrong with his feet? Oh, that's just a little thing he's got going. He'll grow out of it. Mama! Oh, Memphis, he's gorgeous. - Isn't he, though? - Look at you. I got something for you. Open up. Oh, I love the way she does that. W, X, Y and Z Good morning, class. Good morning, Miss Viola. Right. Well, today we begin with the most important lesson you will ever learn... ...at Penguin Elementary. Does anyone know what that is? Anyone? Anyone? Someone? Seymour? - Fishing? - No. Mumble? Don't eat yellow snow? No, that's not it, no. - It's our Heartsong, Miss. - Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, yes. Without our Heartsong, we can't be truly penguin, can we? No. But, my dears, it's not something that I can actually teach you. Does anybody know why? Anyone? Anyone? You can't teach it to us, ma'am... ...because we have to find our Heartsongs all by ourselves. Well done, you. It's the voice you hear inside... ...who you truly are. Yes. Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, lovely, thank you. So let's all be very still now. Take a moment and let it come to you. - I got one! - Pick me! - Pick me! Pick me! - One at a time. Yes, Seymour. Don't push me 'Cause I am close to the edge I'm trying not to lose my head Yes, I like that one. I could really get jiggy with that. Lovely. I'm ready. I got one. Oh, I thought you might, Gloria. Midnight creeps so slowly Into hearts of those Who need more than they get Daylight deals a bad hand To a penguin Who has laid too many bets That's as far as I got so far. - Oh, yes, lovely. Really lovely. - That's beautiful. Well, Mumble, since you seem so keen to share. Mine's sort of a boom and a: And another boom. You heard that in there? - Do you like it? - I'm afraid that's not a tune. - It's not? - No, dear. A tune is like: Oh, okay. Who is that? That is the offspring of Memphis and Norma Jean. The wee hippity-hopper. It's not funny! No. No, not in the least. A penguin without a Heartsong is hardly a penguin at all. I think he broke my ear. In all my years, I've never, I mean... And you having such fine voices. Well, it's bizarre. Did anything happen, you know, during early development? No, all fine. Normal incubation. - Right. - Wasn't it, honey? Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough winter, I guess. Right, right. - He did hatch a little late... - Yes, I understand. Yes. - To think he might spend his life alone... - Quite, quite. ...never to meet his one true love. Oh, please, Miss Viola, isn't there something we can do? Well, there is always Mrs. Astrakhan. Mrs. Astrakhan? If anyone can, Mrs. Astrakhan can. Can't sing? Can't sing? Rubbish, darling. Every little penguin has a song. When I have finished... ...your singing will be giving everyone the goose pimple. Now, to begin. First, we must find a feeling. Happy feeling, sad feeling. Maybe lonely feeling. You feel it? Good. Now, let it out. Be spontaneous. That, what is that? I'm being spontan-you-us. Darling, you want to meet beautiful girl? You want to make the egg? Oh, yes. Well, sing! And no jiggy-jog. Do not move muscle. No moving! Twinkle, twinkle, little star Enough! Okay. We go back to the top. Forget body. Look inside soul. Feel the feeling. Enormous feeling. So enormous it fills whole body. It must escape or you explode. - Now, open your little beak. - Come on. Yes, yes. Lift up the head, that's it. Now... Now... Now Disaster! Catastrophe! I never fail before. Never! Never! - Well, I thought it was kind of cute. - But it just ain't penguin, okay? So what if he's a little different? I always kind of liked different. He's not different. He's a regular emperor penguin. Hey, you know what? I can leave school. I can go to work. The three of us. Whoa, little fella. You ain't going nowhere till you got yourself an education. You get them singing muscles big and strong, you got that? I'll try, Pa. You bet you will. The word ""triumph"" starts with ""try,"" and it ends with...? - ""Umph."" - That's right. A great big ""umph."" I'm going fishing. Oh, Mumble. That first hard summer... ... while his mom and dad were working overtime... ... on the great commute to the sea... ... Mumble found a place away from disapproving eyes... ... where a funky little fella could be himself. Hey, what you doing there, flipper bird? Nothing. What are you doing? Nothing. Just dropped in for a little lunch. There's food? Here? Leg or wing? Oh, no, no, wait. Not me, I'm a penguin. Exactly. The flipper birds, that's you, eat the fish. The flying birds, that's me, eat the flipper bird and the fish. And lately, there ain't a lot of fish. - So... - This time I'm getting the juicy bits. - Me first! - Hey, you want a piece of me? Hey, hey, hey! I'm trying to think about lunch. Wait! Watch this! Yeah, that's weird, all right. Listen. For once, we're gonna do this civilized. - Now, get in line... - Hey! What's that on your leg? - What? This little thing? - Oh, no. Don't start him on that. Shut up! The little flipper bird asked me a perceptive question. - A question like that deserves an answer. - Here we go. I got two words for you: ""Alien abduction."" - Oh, you had to ask. - Have mercy. Quiet! Now, little buddy, there is something out there. Creatures. Not like us. Bigger, fiercer, and smarter too. - Ask me how I know. - How? Because I've been captured by them, that's how. Unbelievable. What do you mean ""unbelievable?"" It's true. I'm sitting on a rock, minding my own business... ...when suddenly, they're onto me. These beings, like big ugly penguins. Fat, flabby faces with front-ways eyes... ...no feathers, no beaks, and these... These appendages. They probe me. They tie me up. They strap me down. They take this pointy thing and they stick it into me. And then, blackout. Gosh. I woke up and there's this... This thing on me. Every flying bird is dissing me, ""Hey, what's happening, yellow leg?"" It was humiliating. And then what? It was humiliating. What more do you want? They could have eated you. Yeah. Yeah. I guess my pitiful cries for mercy appealed to their better nature. Can I appeal to your better nature? Nice try, kid, but no. No. No. No! What you doing down there, flipper bird? Get up here. Get back up here this minute. Oh, great. You let him get away. Didn't you? All your screwy alien talk. - Hey, I'm an abductee. - Abduct this. - Don't make me call Uncle Angie. - Oh, fine. Where youse going? I'm an abductee! - I don't care what you are, I'm hungry! - Would you like to hear our specials? How about fish? There's no fish. How about penguin? There's no penguin. What are we gonna eat?! There's a world where I can go And tell my secrets to In my room Paying no mind to his dancing heart... ... the kid saw out his school days at the back of the class... ... lost in his imaginings. Now it's dark and I'm... What fabulous worlds lay out there, far beyond the ice? I won't be afraid Was there any place... ... where one small penguin without a Heartsong... ... could ever truly belong? In my room And so, a thousand generations ago... ...our forefathers forsook our wings for flippers. You graduates going to sea for the first time... ...are to reap the benefits of their wise choice. These are lean and uncertain times. But by the power of the ancient penguin wisdoms... ...we, my brethren, will endure. - ""Blah, blah, blah."" - Norma Jean. Who is he to say my boy can't graduate? He's not hurting anyone. - True to our ways and you will always be worthy of this... ...our brave penguin nation. Excelsior! Ocean, here I come! You know what? We're gonna have a little graduation ceremony of our own. - You mean it, Ma? - You betcha. - Excelsior! - Excelsior! Keep it down. - Pa. - Memphis. - Go get them, tiger. - Thanks, Ma. - Make every moment count! - Got you, Ma! - Remember, ""Stranger Danger."" - Yeah, sure, Pa. And watch out for those leopard seals and them killer whales. Mark this, Noah. That boy was always a bad egg. I'm telling you, no good will come of this. Guys! Wait up! What do you think? - You first. - No, you first. No. No, no, no. Stop pushing! - What was that? - I think it was the fuzzball. See any blood? What you waiting for? Hey, Gloria! Gloria, I adore-ia. I'd like to see more-ia. Gloria. - Mumble? - Gloria. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Fall back, coming through! Gloria? All my life, I've wanted to say that you're so... - Fish. - Yeah. You're so fish. No. Fish! Fish! Oh, that's mine. - That's lousy. - You didn't get one? Sorry. Gloria. You got one? - Nope. Not this time. - You have it. - Thank you, Mumble, but it's yours. - I want you to have it. - No. You caught it. You eat it. - I want you to... Skua! You get back here! - Come on. - Mumble! Let go! Mumble! Let go! You just let him get away! - Is he breathing? - He's certainly not eating. Mumble? Are you okay? Mumble? Take the fish. - What? - Take the stupid fish. Oh, okay. Thank you, Mumble. You're welcome. - Somebody to Love On this, our night of graduation, infatuation, illumination... ...top of the class, Missy Gloria.

Mystic beings ...during my epic journey of enlightenment... ...to the forbidden shore. Forbidden shore Oh, say it one more. - Forbidden shore - Oh, yeah Wait, you saw mystic beings? I hear them! They speak through me! Oh, yeah. There's a power that makes me stand upon this tower! Did they have front-ways eyes? Did they probe you? Strap you down? Enough! ""Did they probe me?"" Too many questions! You don't have enough pebbles, fool. You haven't answered any of my questions. - How many questions he got? - We've all got stuff to ask! Enough! You bring this stranger before me. He doubts my powers. He compares me to a skua. The voices are shrieking in my head. They say, ""Lovelace, who is this fool? Tell him! Tell him to go forth and multiply!"" Come to think of it... ...why don't we all go forth and multiply? - Lovelace. - What he saying? - It's mating season. - Already? I will retire now to my couch of perpetual indulgence. - Okay, ladies, who's first? - Me! One at a time. Don't touch the talisman, baby, please. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. What about us? Lovelace, Lovelace, Lovelace! Hear me! There's not enough love in the world. Turn to the penguin next to you. Put your flippers up. Fluff him up a little bit. And give him a great big hug. Okay, ladies. Oh, make that little noise again, girl. Hey, what he got we don't got, man? - What you hugging me for? - He told me to. - Get away. - No, you like it. Get off him, Ramon. Stretch, got any stones where you come from? - We don't collect stones. - You don't? Why not? We live on the ice. So how you win the heart of the ladies? Well, we sing. - Stop! That's crazy! - You're kidding, right? No. We sing to each other. If someone special likes your song, you know... Oh, and you have someone special? - A tall beauty in your dark romantic past? - Of which you never speak? Well, sort of. Hey, let's go check it out. Maybe she got some friends. I like them tall. It's never gonna work. - Hey, big guy. - It's the loving season. All you gotta do is sing. That's the problem. I can't. - You a bird, ain't you? - All birds can sing. I don't sing like the birdie do All right. Find me, find me What's he doing? - I think he's singing. - I know singing, that's not singing. I heard an animal once do that, but then they rolled him over, he was dead. Yeah. And when she sings, it darn near breaks your heart. You in tragic shape, man. - Don't worry. We can fix it. - We can? - Absolutely. We can. We can. - We can? - Really? - Yes! Let me tell something to you. - Come close. Closer. You wanna sing? - Yeah. - You sure? - Absolutely. You making fun of me? Then this is very easy. Really? Gosh, if I could sing, that would change everything. You will sing. You just got to do exactly what I say. - Okay. - Did I say ""okay""? - No. - No. What did I say? - Do exactly what you say. - Exactly what I say.

Disgraceful! Who do they think they are? Where is Noah? This is getting out of hand. Go! Hey, Memphis. It's your boy, Mumble. - Mumble? - Mumble? No, no. No, it's ""Mambo."" O! Baby. They're saying, ""Mumble."" Boogie! Behold, Noah, look! This was an omen from the start and now we have this uprising. Stop! Stop! Stop this unruly nonsense! Stop it right now! A little self-control, if you please! You bring this disorder, this aberration, to the very heart of our community. Have you lost your minds? - We're just having fun. - Harmless fun. ""Harmless""? It is this kind of backsliding that has brought the scarcity upon us. Excuse me, smiley. Can you speak plain penguin, please? He thinks the food shortage has something to do with me. Do you not understand that we can only survive here when we're in harmony? When you and your foreign friends lead us into your easy ways... ...you offend the Great 'Guin. You invite him to withhold his bounty. - He rules the seasons. - He giveth and he can taketh away. Wait a minute. Happy feet can't cause a famine. If thy kind of pagan display did not cause it, then what did? I think it comes from outside. Way beyond the ice. There are things out there, things we don't understand. - Mysteries. - Mind-boggling mysteries. - Mystic beings. - Yeah, aliens. - He's mad. - No, aliens. - I hear they're smart. - He's insane. No, they might be smarter than all of us. Who knows? He drove the fish away, now he's ranting this rubbish! - Hey, let me tell something to you. - Don't touch me, you filthy vermin. - Hey, watch it. - And so it follows. Dissent leads to division and division leads us to doom. - You, Mumble Happy Feet, must go. - Hear, hear. Don't you take one step, sweetheart. You have as much right to be here as any of these daffy old fools. Norma Jean, I'll deal with this. Pa? Mumble, you must renounce your so-called friends... ...your peculiar thoughts, your strange ways. - Memphis. - If we are devout... ...sincere in our praise, the fish will return. - But, Pa... - Listen, boy, I was a backslider myself. I was careless and now we're paying the price. What's this got to do with Mumble? - It's why he is the way he is. - There's nothing wrong with him! - Face it, our son's all messed up. - He's not messed up, hear me? - Believe me, I know. - How can you say that? Because when he was just an egg, I dropped him! Memphis. Mumble. Oh, my poor little Mumble. But, Mom, I'm perfectly fine. - No. No, you're not, boy. - That's right. For all our sakes, you must stop this freakiness with the feet. Your father speaks wisely. Heed his suffering heart and repent. But it just doesn't make any sense. Then your arrogance leaves us no choice! No, wait. Please, son, you can do this. It ain't so hard. Don't ask me to change, Pa, because I can't. And that, my brethren, is the end of it. You, begone! - Mumble. - No, Ma, it's okay. It's okay. Let me tell something to you. When I find out what's happening to the fish... ...I'll be back. Let me through? Let me through. - Mumble, you don't have to go. - Let it be. - Gloria. - No. No, Dad, this isn't fair. Gloria, listen to your father. My folks were always putting him down Down, down, down They said he came From the wrong side of town He came from the wrong side of town They told me he was bad So bad - But I know he was sad - So sad I'll never forget him The leader of the pack We sing the heart of our true friend, Mumble. You are a nation of peeny-weeny, piffling, piccolini, piddly-diddly pouft! Together, we prevail. In the wisdoms, we trust. We trust. Look out Look out Look out Look Look out Don't worry, tall guy. My father also called me a pitiful loser. Look how I turn out. You're not helping, Ramon. He gonna be okay. All he gotta do is find out what happened to the fish. - How he gonna do that? - He think of something. - The aliens. - What? - I'm gonna talk to the aliens. - How you gonna find aliens? - Lovelace. - He don't like you. He don't like you at all. That's okay. I'll appeal to his better nature. - How you gonna do that? - Cruel and unusual punishment? - Unimaginable torture? - Imaginable torture? - Your singing? - No! ""Can anybody find me""... - You're cracking the ice! - Avalanche! Yes, okay. Thank you. Lovelace. You there? Lovelace! Lovelace. Lovelace? Is this a bad time? I know we don't have an appointment, but... Just one question and I want a straight answer. Where do I find the mystic beings? Why don't he speak? Lovelace, you okay? - Boy, he's possessed. - It's a seizure! It's a seizure! - Open the beak. - Grab his tongue. He's choking. That thing around his neck, it's too tight. - Well, why didn't you say so? - On three. Stop! Listen! No! Amigos! Amigos! Stop! - What? - You're hurting him. Any better? Lovelace, how did you get that thing around your neck? - It was bestowed on him. - By the mystic beings. - They didn't bestow it? - No. Oh, come on, he don't know what he's saying. You were swimming and it just got caught around your neck. Oh, no way. He the guru. Lovelace, did you ever actually meet a mystic being? Officially? No. I knew it! It's all a lie. But this belongs to someone. If we could find them, I bet you they could take it off. Show me where you found it. I'm sure they could help us. You and me both. Two words, three syllables. - What is it? - You're dying? No, no, wait. Past, past, your past life. You're passing gas. Now he thinks he's an elephant seal. No, no, no. Go over the mountains. - Go over the mountains! - Through the land of the elephant seals. - Beyond the land of the elephant seals. - Beyond the land of the elephant seals! - Wait. - What? I hear voices. - There is a voice. - Where? - There's a little voice on the wind. - Mumble! - ""Mambo""? - ""Mambo""? - Listen. - Mumble Happy Feet. - Gloria? - Gloria! Gloria? Hey, you got a stalker. She's obsessed with you, man. I can't believe it's you. Of course it's me. What are you doing here? All the love in the world can't be gone All the need to be loved can't be wrong - Oh, my. - So which way, twinkletoes? No, no, no. If you come, you may never get back home. Fine by me. Gloria, you have a life back there. I don't. I mean, we don't. Not out here. How can we keep an egg safe? That's if we ever had an egg. Well, I don't need an egg to be happy. You say that now, but what about later when all your friends have eggs? Then I'll have you. Now he's going to pledge his soul forever. - Gloria. - Here it comes. I'm a particular kind of guy, the kind of guy who needs his own space. It's not you, it's me. I'm just not up for a serious relationship right now. What he's trying to do now is he's pushing her away. Let's watch. No matter what you say or do, you're stuck with me. Oh, come on. As if you're not totally thrilled that I'm here. - Now she got him on the ropes. - See, right there is your problem. You think you're irresistible, don't you? I don't care where you're from, that's got to hurt. - Excuse me? - Gloria's so gorgeous, Gloria's so talented. What? Just because you can hit a few high notes. You got a problem with my singing? No, it's perfectly fine. - ""Fine""? - If you like that sort of thing. - It's a little Nana Tootsie for my taste. - What? You know, showy, flashy, froufrou. - ""Froufrou""? - That's right. Coming from someone who thinks it's cool to jig up and down really fast on the spot... ...like some twitchy idiot. You stubborn, hippity-hoppity fool! Right back at you. Amigo, that was a good thing you do. She is going to be so much better off without you. She is going to find a good, steady guy to comfort her... ...and love her up real good and raise a big family. - Ramon. - And then she's going to let herself go... Ramon. He's hurting. He's hurting bad. Oh, listen, listen, don't hold it in or you explode. You got to let it out. You just let it out. You let it out. Everybody, turn away for a moment. If she leave him now She take away the biggest part of him Don't, baby, please, don't go Please, guys. No more singing. Then she say to me, ""Enough, you are making me nauseous."" So I become silent, almost moody, and you know what she says? ""You never share. You got to let it out."" - Ramon, come on. - Let it out. Let it out. Stop it! Let it go. - I never had a good relationship in my life. - Give him a hug. Give him a hug. - I let it out! - There we go. - I let it out. - I know. Get over it. - Can you keep going? - Yeah. - What's that smell? - It wasn't me. Hey, Fluffy, we're following you. Get up here. So these elephant seals, they're not penguin eaters, are they? I don't know. I believe they are herbivores. - What? - You know, kelp-suckers. Here we go, Lovelace. Come on. Jump in time. Jump in time. - Okay, let's do it. - Okay, okay, okay. Ready? I can do this. I can do this. I got to trick myself. Boy, look at that. What? You blokes better be lost, because trespassing's a crime. - We're just passing through. - Yeah. We're with him. You wouldn't be heading over them distant hills... ...and through the blizzard country? If it's the only way to the forbidden shore, yeah. Crikey. You might come face to face with an annihilator. An alien annihilator? Too right. Cut you up as soon as look at you. Waste every living thing in their path. Could they be annihilating the fish? Every living thing. Merciless, mate. Merciless. Even if you're a whopping great whale... ...they drag your sorry carcass ashore... ...dice you up, melt you down, and turn you into fun food. One day you're a big old whale... ...next minute... ...fun food. Someone's gotta stop them. Oh, yeah? What's gonna be your approach? If I could just talk to them. Appeal to their better nature. Beauty. When that crafty little trick pays off, you be sure to let us know, won't you? All right, Lovelace, let's go. See you, Lovelace. Your funeral, mate. Oh, man! - Push tight. - Okay. Come on, guys. Let's do it. You can do it. Come on, push! What's that noise? There's no noise. - No gasping. No wheezing. - Where's Lovelace? Sometimes a brave penguin will just slip away to die. Do you think he went to a happy place? - Probably. - No, no. I think he went this way. Come on. Let's go. Lovelace! Lovelace! Hello? Is there anyone there? - No... No need to shout. - Somebody might hear you. His feet don't look too good. - He rested here. - Now he's on his belly! - No, this way. - You don't want to know what he did here. - You're right. - There he is. Lovelace! - All right! Lovelace! - Lovelace! - Oh, look at Lovelace. - We're here. - Are you okay? - Come on, man. Hang in there, buddy. What is it? Oh, look. There's one for everyone. Hang in there, Lovelace. I know they're here somewhere. - Why would they leave all this behind? - I don't know. Hey. - Tell them we come in peace. - We come in peace! - Lovelace. - Lovelace. - Lovelace. - Oh, buddy, come on. - Are you okay? - Hang in there, buddy. - Oh, that's not good. - Stay calm. - Stay calm. - That's not good. - Okay, don't stay calm! - Panic! Oh, no, no! - Oh, they're making us appe-teasers. - They're appe-teasing us! We're all gonna die. Whatever you do, stay out of the water! - Stay out of the water. - Don't go in the water! Lovelace, don't go in the water! Lovelace, hang in there! Hang in there! Get your dirty tongue off him! No, no, no! Stay out of the water! - Mumble! - Mumble! - They playing birdminton? - No, it's a show. Dinner and a show. Lovelace! Rejoice! Lovelace! - Help! - Reach out! Thank you, my brother, thank you! I wasn't scared! I wasn't scared! Oh, my beautiful brother, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! - Go, Lovelace! You the man! - Go, go, go, go, go! Enough! It's a bad day for you! You dealing with Lovelace now! - And my man, Mumble, here. - You tell them, Lovelace. Begone, demon fish. Adios. That's right. You hightail it back to your mamas. - How did he do that? - Don't make me come in the water. I'll come after your sons and daughters. I'm gonna give you the bad eye. A whole bunch of them. They gonna rule the world. It's gotta be them. - If it is, I don't wanna know about it. - They don't even know we exist. Let me tell something to you. This is the end of the road. It's over. You did everything penguinly possible. - You found the aliens. - We gonna testify to that. We'll tell your whole laughing-boy nation they were dead wrong about you. Now, let's all go back home. Right now. Right on. - Could I ask a favor of you? - Sure. - What kind of favor? - Could you make sure Gloria's okay? - And my ma. - What? And if you see Pa... ...tell him I tried. Okay, what you talking about? I'm gonna stop them taking our fish. How you gonna do that, Mumble? Adios, amigos! Amigo! He did it. You believe that? How we gonna tell his mama he bring us all this way just to kill himself? No. He didn't. Look. He loco maniac. First ever flying flipper bird. How tall you think that tall boy was? Who could say? Taller than anyone. Hey, it's me, Lovelace... ...formerly known as ""guru."" I'm gonna be telling your story, Happy Feet... ...long after you dead and gone! Hey! Hey! Enraged by their indifference... ... he followed them long after they were gone from his sight. He ventured further than any of us had gone before... ... beyond all hope of return. Swept up by the great currents... ... he was carried endlessly across vast oceans... ... to worlds unknown. Excuse me. What is this place? You're in heaven, Dave. Penguin heaven. Is it anywhere near Emperor Land? It's wherever you want it to be. Try the water, Dave. It's really real. I heard tell, when he finally saw aliens up close... ... they were just as the skua had described. Excuse me. Why are you taking our fish? Big, ugly penguins without feathers on their fat, flabby faces. Why are you taking our fish? You're kind of killing us out there. No! No, wait! Oh, my. Hello. Hello from Emperor Land. Good afternoon. Why are you taking our fish? I'm sure you don't mean to, but you're causing an awful lot of grief. Am I not making myself clear? I'm speaking plain penguin. Penguin! Don't you understand? You're stealing our fish. Oh, please, anyone, talk to me! For pity's sake, you're stealing our F-l-S... After three days, he would lose his voice. After three months... ... he would all but lose his mind. So you found the fish, baby. Ma? - Hi, sweetie. - Ma. Fluffy, no matter what they say or do, we never stopped believing in you. So you'll be back soon, right? Hey, come on. Let him eat. Go ahead, Dave. Don't mind us. But there's plenty for everyone. It's okay, sugar. We can wait. No, no, Ma! Ma! There's lots here. Ma! Ma! - Kids, you gotta see this. - He's on now. Hey! Hello! - Isn't that the fellow with the wacky feet? - Looks like. - What was his name? - I thought he was dead. - Everybody... - Apparently not. Everybody, listen up! I've got big news. I know who's taking the fish! - Yeah, and they took his brain. - It's the aliens. - I made contact with them. - The lunatic is back. The aliens are taking our fish. Someone ought to fetch Noah and the elders. Hey, you. Gloria. Kind of weird, seeing you again. Yeah. - Everything cool here, baby? - You remember Seymour. Yeah. Hi, Seymour. Yeah. So which one is yours? All of them. This is our singing class. He teaches rhythm. I teach the blues. - So you're not...? - I guess I never heard the right song. That's great! I didn't mean... I found out who's taking the fish. They're big and kind of ugly, but, Gloria... ...the things they can do. They're coming here. Oh, is that so? They'll be here soon. I think they wanna help us. So now you speak with them? Well, they don't speak penguin, but they seem to respond to this. - What's he doing? - You gotta be kidding me. I suggest we all do it. It really gets their attention. And why would it do that? Beats me, but it works. - Hey, it's the hippity-hopper. - Freaky feet! Boys, boys... - Fluffy. - Tall guy. - Stretch! - Amigo! So you dare come back? He says he's found aliens and they're taking our fish. He says that they're coming and we all have to do this. There be no such thing as aliens! Mumble, turn around. It's a disease. Is that from them? Yeah. But don't be afraid. I think it's a way to find me, that's all. You led them here? You turned them on your own kind? Wait a second, you just said there's no such thing as aliens. Well, there's not. But if there were, only a traitorous fool would bring them here. But they have to come. They're the ones taking our fish. They can do something about it. None but the Great 'Guin has the power to give and take away. The Great 'Guin didn't put things out of whack, the aliens did. A fool returns this day to mock our suffering. We are starving and he wants us to hippity-hop. So do we hold fast to our ways... ...or do we bend to the fetid fantasies of a dancing fool? Say, how does that feet thing go again? Yeah, show us, Mumble. Oh, it's really quite easy. No, no! No, you must resist! That's right. - Pointless nonsense. - Resist! Stand your ground! Stand your ground against this folly! Raise your voices, brothers. Cry out in defiance of this jiggity-joggity! Show me what you got. You got it. Come on. Work, work it. Yes, yes! Call on the wisdoms! Let the world tremble! For when all others leave... ...we remain! Mumble! Mumble! Mama? Amigos. - Oh, Mama. - Oh, my boy. - My gorgeous boy. - Oh, Mama. - Look at him. - You're so dazzling. - Oh, Fluffy. - We waited and waited for you. - Oh, yeah. - Where's Pa? Believe me. You don't wanna see your deadbeat dad. - Your pa is sort of... - What? Come on, I'll show you. Memphis? Memphis? Pa? Mumble? Is it truly you? Every last bit of me, Pa. I thought... Pa? There ain't been one day... ...not one day, that I done right by you. Oh, Pa. Dance for him, Daddy. Dance with your boy. You'll have to forgive me. The music's gone clean out of me. No, it hasn't. It's just like singing with your body. Come on, baby. We can do it. Oh, Mama. It's just one big old foot after the other. That's it. Yeah. - Yeah, see? - Well, that feels good. You don't have to be beautiful Yeah, Memphis. To turn me on Daddy. I just need your body, baby From dusk till dawn You don't have to be rich to be my girl You don't have to be cool To rule my world Ain't no particular song I'm more compatible with I just want your extra time and your... Holy flock! Mommy, Mommy, Mommy. I think you better dance now. First, there was just one. Now there's thousands. - Are they trying to tell us something? - What's the problem? - We're messing with their food chain. - We've gotta do something. - We suggest a ban on all marine harvesting. - Too much money. Too many jobs. Why should we do anything at all? They're just a bunch of flightless birds at the bottom of the world. I don't wanna live in a world without penguins. What are we gonna do about it? Bang up the sign ""No Fishing."" Is equal to the love... ...you make. Oh, baby. Right on. Looking back on when I Was a little nappy-headed boy It's like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder How I keep from going under Bring it on! Go ahead! Even though we sometimes Would not get a thing We were happy with The joy the day would bring I wish those days Would come back once more Come back those days, those days Come back, don't go Come here, babe.

CHUCKLES: That's it? Three guys? GRUMPY: Two guys on the roof. Every guy gets a share. Five shares is plenty. CHUCKLES: Six shares. Don't forget the guy who planned the job. GRUMPY: He thinks he can sit it out and still take a slice. - I know why they call him the Joker. HAPPY: Why do they call him the Joker? DOPEY: I heard he wears makeup. HAPPY: Makeup? DOPEY: Yeah, to scare people. You know, war paint.  GRUMPY: All right, everybody, hands up, heads down! I said, hands up, heads down! Let's go, pal, I'm making a withdrawal here. - I said, hands up! - No! DOPEY: Here comes the silent alarm. And there it goes. GRUMPY: Heads down! All right, tootsie, you're taking a dive with me. - Down! I said, stay down there! WOMAN: Don't hurt me! DOPEY: Funny, it didn't dial 911. It was trying to reach a private number. HAPPY: Is it a problem? DOPEY: No, I'm done here. GRUMPY: Sit down! Down! Down! I said, stay down there! GRUMPY: Obviously we don't want you doing anything with your hands... ...other than holding on for dear life. CHUCKLES: On the ground! Stay on the ground! Nobody make a move! Nobody! Stay down! Yeah! You have any idea who you're stealing from? - You and your friends are dead. GRUMPY: He's out, right? GRUMPY: What...? Where did you learn to count? HAPPY: They wired this thing up with like 5000 volts. What kind of bank does that? GRUMPY: A Mob bank. I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say. Where's the alarm guy? HAPPY: Boss told me when the guy was done, I should take him out. One less share, right? GRUMPY: Funny, he told me something similar. HAPPY: He what? No! No! GRUMPY: That's a lot of money. If this Joker guy was so smart, he'd have had us bring a bigger car. I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me soon as we loaded the cash. BOZO: No, no, no, I kill the bus driver. GRUMPY: Bus driver? What bus driver? DRIVER: School's out. Time to go. That guy's not getting up, is he? That's a lot of money. What happened to the rest of the guys? MANAGER: You think you're smart, huh? The guy that hired youse... ...he'll just do the same to you. Oh, criminals in this town used to believe in things. Honor... ...respect. Look at you. What do you believe in, huh? What do you believe in?! I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you... ...stranger.     MAN 1: Mr. Mayor, you were elected in a campaign to clean up the city. - When are you gonna start? MAN 2: I already have. MAN 1: Like this Batman. We're hearing he's doing good, criminals are running scared. - No, man. I don't like it tonight. - What are you, superstitious? You got more chance of winning the Powerball than running into him. That's not true. Our men in the Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest. Hey, Wuertz, mayor says you're closing in on the Batman. The investigation is ongoing. MAYOR: The process of cleaning up the streets is a long one. I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have... Ever intending to see your wife again, lieutenant? I thought you had to go look after your mother, detective. Checked her back into the hospital. I'm sorry. - So he hasn't shown up? - He often doesn't. I like reminding everybody he's out there. Why wouldn't he come? Hopefully... ...because he's busy.  That's why we bring dogs. - My little princes. MAN: Please. Please, they're crawling in my mouth. Please, I beg you, get them off. CHECHEN: Look what your drugs do to my customers. SCARECROW: Buyer beware. I told you my compound would take you places. I never said they'd be places you wanted to go. My business, repeat customers. SCARECROW: You don't like what I have to offer... ...you can buy from someone else. Assuming Batman left anyone to buy from.  My dogs are hungry. Pity there's only one of you.    CHECHEN: What...? SCARECROW: That's not him. Loose the dogs!  SCARECROW: That's more like it.        Don't let me find you out here again. - We're trying to help you. BATMAN: I don't need help. Not my diagnosis. What gives you the right? What's the difference between you and me? I'm not wearing hockey pads. OFFICER: Everybody back now!  He can't resist showing us his face. GORDON: What's he hiding under that makeup? RAMIREZ: Uh, can we get a minute, people, please? Him again. Who are the others? Another bunch of smalltimers.  BATMAN: Some of the marked bills I gave you. My detectives have been making drug buys with them. This bank was another drop for the Mob. That makes five. - We found the bulk of their dirty cash. - Time to move in. We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup. What about this Joker guy? One man or the entire Mob? He can wait. When the new DA hears about this, he'll want in. - Do you trust him? - Be hard to keep him out. I hear he's as stubborn as you are. ALFRED: Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt. You can swap not sleeping in a penthouse... ...for not sleeping in a mansion. Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess. Yeah. It makes me learn from my mistakes. You ought to be pretty knowledgeable by now, then. My armor. I'm carrying too much weight. I need to be... I need to be faster. I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige. - Did you get mauled by a tiger? - It was a dog. - Huh? - It was a big dog. There were more copycats last night, Alfred, with guns. Why not hire them, take the weekend off? That wasn't exactly what I had in mind... ...when I said I wanted to inspire people. I know. But things have improved. Look at the new district attorney. BRUCE: I am, closely. Need to know if he can be trusted. Are you interested in his character or his social circle? Who Rachel spends her time with is her business. I trust you don't have me followed on my day off. If you ever took one, I might. Know your limits, Master Wayne. Batman has no limits. - Well, you do, sir. - Well, can't afford to know them. And what's gonna happen on the day that you find out? We all know how much you like to say ""I told you so."" On that day, Master Wayne, even I won't want to. Probably.  MAN: Sorry I'm late, folks.  - Where were you? - Worried you'd have to step up? - Harvey, I know these briefs backwards. - Well, then... ...fair's fair. Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours. Yeah? You wanna flip a coin to see who leads? My father's lucky coin. As I recall, it got me my first date with you. I wouldn't leave something like that up to chance. I don't. I make my own luck. BAILIFF: All rise. The Honorable Judge Freel presiding. I thought the DA just played golf with the mayor. Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time to put you away for life, Sally. With Carmine Falcone in Arkham... ...someone must have stepped up to run the so-called family. Is that man in this courtroom today? - Could you identify him for us, please? - You win, counselor. It was me.  I have a sworn statement from you that this man... ...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head of the Falcone crime family. Maroni? He's a fall guy. I'm the brains of the organization.  JUDGE: Order. - Permission to treat... ...the witness as hostile? - Granted. - Hostile? I'll show you hostile!   Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China. If you wanna kill a public servant, Mr. Maroni... ...I recommend you buy American. JUDGE: Get him out of here. - But, Your Honor, I'm not done.  We'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni, so we can't charge him. But they're trying to kill you, means we're getting to them. I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm fine, by the way. Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA. You're not getting shot at, you're not doing your job right. But, you know... ...if you said you were rattled, we could take the rest of the day off. Can't. I dragged the head of the Major Crimes Unit down here. Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually. Try to be nice. I hear you got a hell of a right cross. It's a shame Sal's going to walk. Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob is they keep giving you second chances. Lightly irradiated bills. Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help? We liaise with various agencies... Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him. Official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as Batman on sight. Mm-hm. What about that floodlight on the top of MCU? If you got problems with malfunctioning equipment... ...I suggest you take them up with Maintenance, counselor. I've put every money launderer in Gotham behind bars... ...but the Mob is still getting its money out. I think you and your friend have found the last game in town. You're trying to hit them where it hurts, their wallets. It's bold. You gonna count me in? In this town, the fewer people know something, the safer the operation. I don't like that you got your own special unit... ...and it's full of cops I investigated at Internal Affairs. If I didn't work with cops you'd investigated while at IA... ...I'd be working alone. I don't get political points for being an idealist. I do the best I can with what I have. You want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks... ...without telling me what we're after. I can give you the names of the banks. Well, that's a start. I'll get you your warrants, but I want your trust. Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent. We all know you're Gotham's white knight. Yeah, well, I heard they have a different name for me down at MCU. I wouldn't know about that. MAN: In China, Lau Security Investments stands for dynamic new growth. A joint Chinese venture with Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse. FOX: Well, Mr. Lau... ...I speak for the rest of the board... ...and Mr. Wayne, in expressing our own excitement. Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about how his trust fund gets replenished... ...but, frankly, this is embarrassing. You worry about the diligence, Mr. Reese. I'll worry about Bruce Wayne. It's done. The numbers are solid. Do them again. Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out, now, would we?  FOX: Another long night? This joint venture was your idea, and the consultants love it. But I'm not convinced. Lau's company has grown by 8 percent annually like clockwork. His revenue stream must be off the books... ...maybe even illegal. Okay. Cancel the deal. You already knew. Just needed a closer look at their books. Anything else you can trouble me for? I need a new suit. Yeah. Three buttons is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne. I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox, so much as function. You wanna be able to turn your head. Sure make backing out of the driveway easier. I'll see what I can do. Took three weeks to get a reservation here. I had to tell them I work for the government. - Really? - Health inspector's... ...not afraid to pull strings. Rachel. Fancy that. Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that. Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel. - Natascha. Are you the prima...? - Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet. - Wow. Harvey's taking me next week. - Really? So you're into ballet? Bruce. This is Harvey Dent. The famous Bruce Wayne. Rachel's told me everything about you. I certainly hope not. - Let's put a couple tables together. - I'm not sure that they'll let us. Oh, they should. I own the place. How could you want to raise children in a city like this? Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay. Is Wayne Manor in the city limits? Is...? Heh-heh. The Palisades? Sure. You know, as our new DA, you might wanna figure out... ...where your jurisdiction ends. I'm talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante. Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen standing up for what's right. Gotham needs heroes like you, elected officials... ...not a man who thinks he's above the law. Who appointed the Batman? We did. All of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city. NATASCHA: But this is a democracy, Harvey. DENT: When their enemies were at the gates... ...the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service. Harvey, the last man that they appointed... ...to protect the republic was named Caesar... ...and he never gave up his power. - Okay, fine. You either die a hero... ...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't wanna do this for the rest of his life. How could he? Batman is looking for someone to take up his mantle. NATASCHA: Someone like you, Mr. Dent? Maybe. If I'm up to it. What if Harvey Dent is the Caped Crusader? Hm? If I were sneaking out every night, someone would've noticed by now. Well, I'm sold, Dent, and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser. That's nice, but I'm not up for reelection for three years. No, you don't understand. One fundraiser with my pals... ...you'll never need another cent.  What the hell is this? As you're all aware, one of our deposits was stolen. A relatively small amount, 68 million. Who's stupid enough to steal from us? Two-bit wackjob, wears a cheap purple suit and makeup. He's not the problem. He's a nobody. The problem is our money being tracked by the cops. Thanks to Mr. Maroni's well-placed sources... ... we know that police have indeed identified our banks using marked bills... ... and are planning to seize your funds today. And since the enthusiastic new D A has put all my competitors out of business... ...I'm your only option. MARONl: So, what are you proposing? LAU: Moving all deposits to one secure location, not a bank. - Where, then? - No one can know but me. If the police were to gain leverage over one of you... ... everyone's money would be at stake. What stop them getting to you? I go to Hong Kong, far from Dent's jurisdiction... ... and the Chinese will not extradite one of their own. MARONl: How soon can you move the money? LAU: I already have. For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait for your permission. Rest assured, your money is safe.  Oh, hee-hee, aha. Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha. And I thought my jokes were bad. Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my boy pull your head off. How about a magic trick? I'm gonna make this pencil disappear. Ta-da! It's... It's gone. Oh, and by the way, the suit, it wasn't cheap. - You ought to know, you bought it. CHECHEN: Sit. I want to hear proposition. JOKER: Let's wind the clocks back a year. These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you. I mean, what happened? Did your balls drop off? Hm? You see, a guy like me... - A freak. MOBSTER 1: Damn right. A guy like me... Look, listen. I know why you choose to have your little, ahem... ...group-therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. The Batman. See, Batman has shown Gotham your true colors, unfortunately. Dent, he's just the beginning. And as for the television's so-called plan... ...Batman has no jurisdiction. He'll find him and make him squeal. I know the squealers when I see them... ...and... CHECHEN: What do you propose? It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.  If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already? If you're good at something, never do it for free. How much you want? Uh, half.  GAMBOL: You're crazy. - No, I'm not. No, I'm not. If we don't deal with this now... ...soon... ...little Gambol here won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma. Enough from the clown! Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow... MOBSTER 2: Shit! ...this out of proportion. You think you can steal from us and just walk away? - Yeah. GAMBOL: I'm putting the word out. Five hundred grand for this clown dead. A million alive, so I can teach him some manners first. All right. So, listen, why don't you give me a call... ...when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously? Here's my card. Mm-mm. You're a hard man to reach. Lau's halfway to Hong Kong. If you'd have asked, I could have taken his passport. All that was left in the vaults were marked bills. They knew we were coming. As soon as your office got involved... My office? You're sitting down there with scum like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking... Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beat. Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly Maroni's got people in your office, Dent. We need Lau back... ...but the Chinese won't extradite a national under any circumstances. If I get him to you, can you get him to talk? I'll get him to sing. We're going after the Mob's life savings. Things will get ugly. I knew the risk when I took this job, lieutenant. How will you get him back, any...? He does that. Our Chinese friends left town before I could tell them the deal was off. Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted to go to Hong Kong. What's wrong with a phone call? I think Mr. Lau deserves a more personal touch. FOX: Now, for high-altitude jumps... ...you're going to need oxygen and stabilizers. Well, I must say, compared to your usual requests... ...jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward. BRUCE: What about getting back into the plane? - I'd recommend a good travel agent. - Without it landing. Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne. The CIA had a program back in the '60s... ...for getting their people out of hot spots called Sky Hook. - We could look into that. - Yeah. Okay. Now... Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped... ...tri-weave fibers for flexibility. You'll be lighter, faster, more agile. Perhaps you should read the instructions first? - Yeah. - Now, there is a tradeoff. Separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable to knives and gunfire. We wouldn't wanna make things too easy, now, would we? How will it hold up against dogs? We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas? Should do fine against cats. I found one in Arizona. A very nice man said he could have it up and running in a week... ...and he takes cash. - What about the flight crew? - South Korean smugglers. They run flights into Pyongyang, below radar. - Did you think of an alibi? - Oh, yes. I believe this is your plane, sir. You look tired, Alfred. You'll be all right without me? If you can tell me the Russian for ""apply your own bloody suntan lotion."" Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you. They say they've just killed the Joker. BOD YGUARD: They brought the body. So, dead, that's 500. How about alive? Hm? You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was... ...a drinker... ...and a fiend. And one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that... ...not one bit. So, me watching... ...he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says: ""Why so serious?"" He comes at me with the knife. ""Why so serious?"" He sticks the blade in my mouth. ""Let's put a smile on that face."" And... Why so serious? Now... ...our operation is small... ...but there is a lot of potential... ...for aggressive expansion. So which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team? Oh. There's only one spot open right now, so we're gonna have... ...tryouts. Make it fast. MAN: Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox. Mr. Lau regrets he is unable to greet you in person today. FOX: I understand. For security purposes, I'm gonna have to ask you to check in your mobile. Of course. I must apologize for leaving Gotham in the middle of our negotiations. This misunderstanding with the Gotham police force... - ...I couldn't let it threaten my company. - Of course. A businessman of your stature will understand and... ...with you here now, we can continue. Well, I do appreciate you bringing me out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...  We do not allow cell phones in here. I'm sorry. Forgot I had it. No, I really came to tell you that our business deal has to be put on hold. You see, we can't afford to be seen to do business with... ...whatever it is you're accused of being. I'm sure a businessman of your stature will understand. I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed. Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think he was deliberately wasting your time. Just accidentally wasting it. That's very good, Mr. Lau. ""Accidentally."" Very good. Hey, sir. There's a better view from the peak tram. How's the view from LSI Holdings? Restricted. Lau is holed up in there good and tight. - What's this? - I had R & D work it up. Sends out a high-frequency pulse... ...records the response time for mapping an environment. Sonar. Just like a... Submarine, Mr. Wayne. Like a submarine. - And the other device? - It's in place. Mr. Wayne? Good luck.          RACHEL: Look, give us the money and we'll talk about making a deal. The money is the only reason I'm still alive. Oh, you mean, when they find out that you've helped us, they're gonna kill you? - Are you threatening my client? - No. I'm just assuming your client's cooperation with this investigation. As will everyone. No? Okay. Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau. LAU: Wait! I won't give you the money... ...but I will give you my clients, all of them. You were a glorified accountant. What could you possibly have on all of them that we could charge? I'm good with calculation. I handled all their investments. One big pot. Got it. One minute. RICO. If they pooled their money... ...we can charge them as one criminal conspiracy. Charge them with what? In a RICO case, if you can charge one of them with a felony... You can charge all of them with it. That's great. Mr. Lau. What kind of details do you have about this communal fund? - Ledgers...? - Immunity, protection... ...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong. - After you testify in open court. I'm just curious. With all your clients locked up... ...what's gonna happen with all that money? Like I said, I'm good with calculation. He can't go to County. I'll keep him here in the holding cells. What is this, Gordon, your fortress? Well, you trust them over at County? I don't trust them here. Lau stays. Well, I don 't know about Mr. Lau's travel arrangements... ... but I'm sure glad he's back. Put word out. We hire the clown. He was right. We have to fix real problem. Batman. - I'm not aware of any participation... - Our boy looks good on the tube. You sure you wanna embarrass me in front of my friends? Oh, don't worry. They're coming too. STEPHENS: Have a nice trip. See you next fall. WOMAN: Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion. Eight hundred and forty-nine counts of racketeering. Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud. Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder. Five hundred and twenty-seven counts of obstruction of justice. How do the defendants plead?  Order in the court. MAYOR: Five hundred and forty-nine criminals at once. How did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce? She shares my enthusiasm for justice. After all, she is a judge. Even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of Surrillo... ...you're gonna set a new record at appeals. It won't matter. The head guys make bail, sure. But the midlevel guys, they can't. They can't afford to be off the streets. They'll cut deals that include some jail time. Think of all you could do with 18 months of clean streets. LOEB: Mr. Mayor, you can't... - No, get out. Both of you. Sit down. The public likes you. That's the only reason that this might fly. But that means it's on you. They're all gonna come after you now, and not just the Mob. Politicians, journalists, cops. Anyone whose wallet's about to get lighter. Are you up to it? You'd better be. Because they get anything on you... ...and those criminals are back on the streets, followed swiftly by you and me. Jesus!  ALFRED: I think your fundraiser will be a great success, sir. BRUCE: And why do you think I wanna hold a party for Harvey Dent? I assumed it was your usual reason for socializing beyond myself... ...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly: To try to impress Miss Dawes. Very droll, but very wrong. Actually, it's Dent. ENGEL : Police released video footage found concealed on the body. Sensitive viewers, be aware. The image is disturbing. JOKER: Tell them your name. Brian Douglas.  JOKER: And are you the real Batman? BRIAN: No. JOKER: No? - No. - No? Then why do you dress up like him?  Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! BRIAN: Because he's a symbol that we don 't have to be afraid of scum like you. Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do. Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh. So you think Batman 's made Gotham a better place? Hm? Look at me. Look at me! You see, this is how crazy Batman 's made Gotham. You want order in Gotham... ... Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in. Oh, and every day he doesn 't, people will die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of my word.    Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld... ...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade. - I'll be back. - Rachel. A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent? - Thank you. Alfred, right? - That's right, sir. Rachel talks about you all the time. You've known her her whole life. Not yet, sir. Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of? Oh, you have no idea.  BRUCE: I'm sorry that I'm late. I'm glad to see that you all got started without me. Now, where is Harvey? Where...? Harvey Dent, the man of the hour. Where's Rachel Dawes? She is my oldest friend. Come here. When Rachel first told me she was dating Harvey Dent... ...I had one thing to say: ""The guy from those God-awful campaign commercials?"" ""I believe in Harvey Dent."" Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey. But it caught Rachel's attention. And then I started to pay attention to Harvey... ...and all that he's been doing as our new DA. And you know what? I believe in Harvey Dent. I believe that on his watch, Gotham can feel... ...a little safer, a little more optimistic. Look at this face. This is the face of Gotham's bright future. To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him. MAN: Harvey. Harvey may not know you well enough... ...to understand you're making fun of him... ...but I do. - No, I meant every word. You know that day that you once told me about... ...when Gotham would no longer need Batman? - It's coming. - Bruce. - You can't ask me to wait for that. - It's happening now. Harvey is that hero. He locked up half of the city's criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask. Gotham needs a hero with a face. DENT: You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll give you that. Thanks again. You mind if I borrow Rachel? Lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the body? Forensics found three sets of DNA. - Any matches? - All three. The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo, Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb. The Joker's telling us who he's targeting. Get a unit over to Surrillo's house. Tell Wuertz to find Dent. Protective custody. Where's the commissioner? - City hall. - Seal the building. - No one in or out till I get there. - Got it. Gordon. What are you up to? We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor search of the entire building. We believe the Joker's made a threat against your life. These are dangerous people. You're not giving me a lot of information. Even we don't know where you're going. Take the envelope, get in, open it. It'll tell you where you're headed. You can't leave me alone with these people. The whole Mob's after you and you're worried about these guys? Compared to this, the Mob doesn't scare me. Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this for yourself, so... ...take my word, the police commissioner earns a lot of threats. I found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago. Them gunning for you makes you see things clearly. Yeah, I bet. Yeah. It makes you think about things you couldn't stand losing... ...about who you wanna spend your life with. - That's a pretty big commitment. - Not if the Mob has their way. You get to explain to my wife... ...why I'm late for dinner. Sir, the joker card had traces of your DNA on it. - Don't do that. - All right. - Let's be serious, then. - Okay. What's your answer? I don't have an answer. How'd they get my DNA? Somebody with access to your office or house... ...must have lifted a tissue or a glass... Wait! Wait! - Well, I guess no answer is a no. - Harvey. - It's someone else, isn't it? - Harvey. Just tell me it's not Wayne. The guy's a complete f... What are you doing? GORDON: Oh, shit.  GORDON: Get a medic! They've come for him. We made it. Stay hidden.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are tonight's entertainment. I only have one question: Where is Harvey Dent? You know where Harvey is? You know who he is? THUG: Hands up, pretty boy.  Do you know where I can find Harvey? I need to talk to him. Just something little, huh? No. What's going on out there? Wayne! Oh, thank God, you've got a panic room. MAN: Hey, wait... Oh, you gotta be kidding me. You know, I'll settle for his loved ones. We're not intimidated by thugs. You know... ...you remind me of my father. I hated my father. RACHEL: Okay, stop. Well, hello, beautiful. You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm? And you are beautiful. You look nervous. Is it the scars? You wanna know how I got them? Come here. Hey. Look at me. So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you... ...who tells me I worry too much... ...who tells me I ought to smile more... ...who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. Hm? I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. So... ...I stick a razor in my mouth and do this... ...to myself. And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.  You got a little fight in you. I like that. BATMAN: Then you're gonna love me.   Drop the gun. Oh, sure. You just take off your little mask... ...and show us all who you really are. Hm? Let her go. Very poor choice of words.   Are you all right? Let's not do that again. - Is Harvey okay? - He's safe. Thank you. Jim, it's over. As long as they don't get to Lau, we've cut off their funds. The prosecution's over. Nobody's standing up in front of a judge... ...while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away. - What about Dent? - He's got any sense... ...Dent's halfway to Mex... DENT: So where do you keep your trash? You're due in court. I need you alive long enough to get you on the record. You can't protect me. You can't even protect yourselves. You refuse to cooperate, you're not coming back here, you go to County. How long do you calculate you'll last in there? Targeting me won't get their money. I knew the Mob wouldn't go down easily... ...but this is different. They crossed a line. You crossed the line first. You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation. And in their desperation, they turned to a man they didn't fully understand. Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred. We just need to figure out what he's after. ALFRED: With respect, Master Wayne... ...perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either. A long time ago, I was in Burma... ...and my friends and I were working for the local government. They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders... ...by bribing them with precious stones... ...but their caravans were being raided in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit. So we went looking for the stones. But in six months, we never met anyone who traded with him. One day, I saw a child playing with a ruby... ...the size of a tangerine. The bandit had been throwing them away. - So why steal them? - Because he thought it was good sport. Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.  WOMAN: Your name, sir? JOKER: Eighth and Orchard. You'll find Harvey Dent there. BATMAN: Check the names. ""Richard Dent."" ""Patrick Harvey."" Harvey Dent. I need 10 minutes with the scene before your men contaminate it. It's because of you these guys are dead... Detective! Give us a minute, guys. That's brick underneath. Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet? No. Fingerprints. Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast. Because we found his next target. He's put it in tomorrow's paper. I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir. What can I do for you, Mr. Reese? You wanted me to do the diligence on the LSI Holdings deal again. Well, I found some irregularities. Their CEO is in police custody. No, not with their numbers, with yours. Applied Sciences. Whole division of Wayne Enterprises... ...just disappeared overnight. I went down to the archives and I started pulling some old files. Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby... ...pancaking cop cars on the evening news. Now you got the entire R & D Department burning through cash... ...claiming it's related to cell phones for the Army? What are you building for him now, a rocket ship? I want... ...$ 10 million a year for the rest of my life. Let me get this straight. You think that your client... One of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world... ...is secretly a vigilante... ...who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands... ...and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck. When... Keep that. FOX: This is your original scan. Here it is reengineered. And there's the thumbprint he left when he pushed the round in the clip. I'll get you a copy. Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D? Yeah. Government telecommunications project. Wasn't aware we had any government contracts. You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest. Fair enough. ENGEL: With no word from the Batman... ...even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb... ...these cops have to wonder if the Joker will make good on his threat... ...in the obituary column of The Gotham Times to kill the mayor. I've checked all the databases. There are four possibles. Cross-reference the addresses. Look for Parkside, overlooking the parade. I got one. Melvin White, 1502 Randolph Apartments. Aggravated assault, moved to Arkham twice. What do you got on the roof? We're tight, but frankly, there's a lot of windows up here. Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life to law enforcement... ...and to the protection of his community. I remember when I first took office... ...and I asked if he wanted to stay on as commissioner. And he said he would, provided I kept my politics out of his office. Clearly he was not a man who minced words, nor should he have been. A number of policies that he enacted as commissioner were unpopular. Policies that flooded my office with angry calls and letters... - Who's that? - What happened? They took our guns. And our uniforms.  MAYOR: And as we recognize the sacrifice of this man... ...we must remember that vigilance is the price of safety. Stand by. Honor guard. Attention. Port arms. Ready! Aim! Fire! Ready! Aim!  Ready! Aim!   OFFICER: Stay down! Don't move! STEPHENS: Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here. - I'll see you later. - Why are you going back?   Get out of here. Tell me what you know about the Joker.   No. I'm sorry, Barbara. Jimmy, go play with your sister. Go ahead, honey. STEPHENS: If there's anything we can do, anything you need... ...we're here for you.  Shh. BARBARA: Are you out there? Are you? You brought this craziness on us. You did! You brought this on us! Switch it off, he ain't coming. He doesn't wanna talk to us. God help whoever he does wanna talk to.  Can't we go someplace quieter? We can't hear each other talk. What makes you think I wanna hear you talk? What?   - Yeah? MAN: Second. Okay. - Harvey, where are you? DENT: Where are you? I'm where you should be, at Major Crimes. I'm trying to deal with all of this mess. - Can I get the fingerprint analysis? - Rachel, listen. You're not safe there. - This is Gordon's unit. - Gordon 's gone. RACHEL: He vouched for these men. - And he's gone. The Joker's named you next. God, is there someone, is there anyone in this town we can trust? Bruce. We can trust Bruce Wayne. No. Rachel, I know you're his friend, but... Harvey, trust me. Bruce's penthouse is now the safest place in the city. Then you go straight there. Don 't tell anybody and I'll find you there. I love you. I want the Joker. From one professional to another... ...you're trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot. From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me. - I'm counting on it. - Huh!     - Where is he? - I don't know where he is. He found us. He must have friends. Friends? Have you met this guy? Someone knows where he is. Nobody's gonna tell you nothing. They're wise to your act. You got rules. The Joker, he's got no rules. Nobody's gonna cross him for you. If you want this guy, you got one way. But you already know what that is. Just take off that mask, let him come find you.  Or you can let a couple more people get killed while you make up your mind. You wanna play games?  How's that feel? - You wouldn't. - I wouldn't! - You don't think I will? - Mm-mm. - You don't think I will? - Mm-mm. No. No, I wouldn't. That's why I'm not gonna leave it up to me. Heads, you get to keep your head. Tails... ...not so lucky. So you wanna tell me about the Joker?  - Let's go again. - I don't know anything! God, don't! You're not playing the odds, friend. Let's do it again. You'd leave a man's life to chance? - Not exactly. - His name's Schiff, Thomas. He's a paranoid schizophrenic, former patient at Arkham. The kind of mind the Joker attracts. What do you expect to learn from him? The Joker killed Gordon. He's gonna kill Rachel. You're the symbol of hope I could never be. Your stand against organized crime... ...is the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades. If anyone saw this, everything would be undone. The criminals you arrested would be released... ...and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing. You're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow. - Why? - No one else will die because of me. Gotham's in your hands now. You can't. You can't give in. You can't give in! Harvey called. He said Batman's gonna turn himself in. I have no choice. You honestly think that's gonna keep the Joker from killing people? Maybe not. But I have enough blood on my hands. And I've seen now what I would have to become to stop men like him. You once told me that if the day came when I was finished... ...that we'd be together. Bruce, don't make me your one hope for a normal life. Did you mean it? Yes. Bruce. If you turn yourself in, they're not gonna let us be together. ALFRED: Logs as well? BRUCE: Everything. Anything that could lead back to Lucius or Rachel. People are dying, Alfred. What would you have me do? Endure, Master Wayne. Take it. They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of Batman. He can be the outcast. He can make the choice that no one else can make. The right choice. No, today I found out what Batman can't do. He can't endure this. Today you get to say ""I told you so."" Today, I don't want to. But I did bloody tell you.  ALFRED: I suppose they're gonna lock me up as well... ...as your accomplice. BRUCE: Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea. Ladies and gentlemen, I've called this press conference for two reasons. Firstly, to assure the citizens of Gotham... ...that everything that can be done over the Joker killings is being done.  Secondly, because the Batman has offered to turn himself in. But let's consider the situation. Should we give in to this terrorist's demands? Do we really think he's gonna...? You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante than the lives of citizens? The Batman is an outlaw. That's not why we demand he turn himself in... ...we're doing it because we're scared. We've been happy to let Batman clean up our streets till now. MAN 1: Things are worse than ever! MAN 2: Amen. Yes, they are. But the night is darkest just before the dawn. And I promise you... ...the dawn is coming. One day, the Batman will have to answer for the laws he's broken. But to us... ...not to this madman. - No more dead cops! OFFICERS: Yeah! He should turn himself in! MAN 3: Give us the Batman! Come on! MAN 4: Where is he? So be it. Take the Batman into custody. WOMAN: What? MAN 5: Is he here? I am the Batman. MAN 6: What? MAN 7: Come on. RACHEL: Alfred. Why is he letting Harvey do this? - He went down to the press conference. - I know. He just stood by. Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent... ...believe that Batman stands for something more important... ...than the whims of a terrorist, Miss Dawes... ...even if everyone hates him for it. That's the sacrifice he's making. He's not being a hero. He's being something more. Yeah, you're absolutely right. Letting Harvey take the fall for this is not heroic at all. You know him better than anyone. I do. Will you give this to him for me? When the time is right? How will I know? It's not sealed. Goodbye, Alfred. Bye, Rachel.  I didn't have time to talk this through. What are you doing? They're transferring me to Central Holding. This is the Joker's chance, and when he attacks, the Batman will take him down. Listen. This is too dangerous. We get this guy to County, he's their problem. The streets will be cleared... ...so let's go. The convoys stop for no reason. I hope you got some moves, pal. He's using you as bait. He doesn't know if he can get the Joker. He's failed so far. How do you know what he's thinking? I just do. Anyway, this isn't just about you. What about the people depending on you... ...to clean the city up and do it honorably and...? Harvey. Tell everyone the truth. Heads, I go through with it. This is your life. You can't leave... ...something like that to chance. - I'm not.  You make your own luck.  Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal. What the hell is that? Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead! Damn it! All units divert down onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down. Exit down! Lower Fifth? We'll be like turkeys on Thanksgiving. Jesus. Come on, get us out of here. Let's go. Listen, we need backup. We've got company. We got trouble, guys. Lock and load!   The hell was that? - These are built for that, right? - He'll need something... ...a lot bigger to get through this. What is that? What is that, a bazooka? I didn't sign up for this! Look out. Look out! JOKER: Hmm. Come on, let's go!   Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent. Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive. COMPUTER: Scanning all systems. Scanning all systems.  We gotta get topside. We need air support, now! I like this job. I like it. COMPUTER: Damage catastrophic. Eject sequence initiated.   Goodbye. We're on point, ready to give them some of their own medicine. That's what I'm talking about. Air cav. Okay, rack them up. Rack them up, rack them up, rack them up.  That's not good. Okay, that's not good!    Now, there's a Batman. Ooh, you wanna play. Come on. Come on. He missed! You can't stop here. We're like sitting ducks!  Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. I want you to do it, I want you to do it. Come on! Come on. Come on. I want you to do it, I want you to do it. Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!  Hit me!     Come on, come on. Aah! Could you please just give me a minute? We got you, you son of a bitch. Gor... You do like to play things pretty close to the chest. We got him, Harvey. REPORTER 1: Mr. Dent! How does it feel to be the biggest hero in Gotham? No, I'm no hero. Gotham's finest, they're the heroes. REPORTER 1: But you and your office... ...have been working with the Batman all along. No, but I trusted him to do the right thing. REPORTER 2: Which was? - Saving my ass. All right, people, that's enough. Let him be. Let him be. Thank you, detective. I've got a date with a pretty upset girlfriend. - I figured, counselor. REPORTER 3: Mr. Dent, sir... ...how about one for the front page, sir? REPORTER 4: Mr. Dent.  Stand away! All of you! I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer to use, you understand? Back from the dead. I, uh... ...couldn't risk my family's safety. MAYOR: What do we got? Nothing. No matches on prints, DNA, dental. Clothing is custom, no labels. Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint. No name. - No other alias. MAYOR: Go home, Gordon. The clown'll keep till morning. Go get some rest. You're gonna need it. Tomorrow you take the big job. You don't have any say in the matter. Commissioner Gordon.  I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.  MURPHY: Look at these ugly bastards. - I don't feel good. MURPHY: You're a cop killer. You're lucky to be feeling anything below the neck. - Please! - Step away from the bars! THUG: My insides hurt. Did Batman save you, Daddy? Actually, this time... ...I saved him.  GORDON: Has he said anything yet?  Evening, commissioner. Harvey Dent never made it home. - Of course not. - What have you done with him? Me? I was right here. Who did you leave him with? Hm? Your people? Assuming, of course, that they are still your people... ...and not Maroni's. Does it depress you, commissioner... ...to know just how alone you really are? Does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dent's current predicament? - Where is he? - What's the time? What difference does that make? Well, depending on the time, he may be in one spot or several. - lf we're gonna play games... - Mm-hm? ...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee. Ah, the ""good cop, bad cop"" routine? Not exactly.    Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next... See? You wanted me. Here I am. JOKER : I wanted to see what you'd do. And you didn't disappoint. You let five people die. Then you let Dent take your place. - Even to a guy like me, that's cold. - Where's Dent? Those Mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were. But I know the truth. There's no going back. You've changed things. - Forever. - Then why do you wanna kill me?  I don't wanna kill you. What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no. No. No, you... You complete me. - You're garbage who kills for money. - Don't talk like one of them. You're not. Even if you'd like to be. To them, you're just a freak... ...like me. They need you right now... ...but when they don't... ...they'll cast you out like a leper. You see, their morals, their code... ...it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these... These civilized people... ...they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve. Where's Dent? You have all these rules, and you think they'll save you. - He's in control. - I have one rule. Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have to break to know the truth. Which is? The only sensible way to live is without rules. And tonight you're gonna break your one rule. I'm considering it. There's only minutes left, so you'll have to play my game... ...if you wanna save one of them. ""Them""? You know, for a while there, I thought you really were Dent. The way you threw yourself after her.   Look at you go.  Does Harvey know about you and his little bunny? Where are they?! Killing is making a choice. - Where are they?! - Choose between one life or the other. Your friend the district attorney, or his blushing bride-to-be.  You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength. Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you where they are, both of them. And that's the point. You'll have to choose. He's at 25052nd Street... ...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero. - Which one you going after? - Rachel. GORDON: We're getting Dent! 25052nd Street! RACHEL : Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello! - Rachel? - Harvey. Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay? I'm all right. I'm in a... I'm in a warehouse. They got me wired to these oil drums. I am too. Harvey. I want my phone call. I want it. I want it. I want my phone call. That's nice. How many of your friends have I killed? I'm a 20-year man... ...and I know the difference between punks who need a lesson in manners... ...and the freaks like you who would just enjoy it. And you killed six of my friends.  Six? Please. My insides hurt. I don't really care. Back away. The boss said he'd make the voices go away. He said he'd go inside and replace them with bright lights... ...like Christmas. You're out of your mind, pal. Back off. Medic to the holding tank. Come on. Get the door open. You guys, back off! Listen, we don't have a lot of time. They told me that only one of us was gonna make it... ...and that they were gonna let our friends choose. Okay, Rachel. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right. They're coming for you. Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me through what's going on with you. Can you find something, anything, sharp? I'm trying. - What's...? - Shit. Harvey?  Harvey, what's happening?  All available units, converge at 25052nd Street. Do you wanna know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can't savor all the... ...little emotions. You see, in their last moments... ...people show you who they really are. So in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of them were cowards? OFFICER: What's that? MEDIC: Jeez. He's got some kind of a... ...contusion. - I know you're gonna enjoy this.  I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it even more. OFFICER 1: Whoa, whoa! OFFICER 2: Just put it down. Take it easy. Take it easy. Drop the weapon now! - It's my own damn fault, just shoot him! - Let him go now! Drop it! - What? Sorry? - What do you want? I just want my phone call. RACHEL: What...? What...? What's happening? Just talk to me, just for one second. - All right? - Right. Ow. - Ow. - Shh, shh, shh.  Is that a phone? Mount the curb! Harvey, just in case, I wanna tell you something, okay? Don 't think like that. They're coming. I know they are, but I don't want them to. I don't wanna live without you, and I do have an answer for you. My answer is yes. No! No! No! Not me! Why are you coming for me? No! Rachel! Rachel! - Harvey. - No! No! Rachel! Okay. Rachel! No! No! Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen. Somewh... RAMIREZ: No, commissioner! Rachel! No!  Hello there. SERGEANT: Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone. With Lau? The Joker planned to be caught. He wanted me to lock him up in the MCU.   RACHEL: Dear Bruce: I need to be honest and clear. I'm going to marry Harvey Dent. I love him, and I wanna spend the rest of my life with him. When I told you that if Gotham no longer needed Batman, we could be together... ... I meant it. But now I'm sure the day won 't come when you no longer need Batman. I hope it does. And if it does, I will be there... ... but as your friend. I'm sorry, Harvey. RACHEL: I'm sorry to let you down. If you lose your faith in me, please keep your faith in people. Love, now and always, Rachel. ALFRED: Prepared a little breakfast. - Very well, then. - Alfred. Yes, Master Wayne? Did I bring this on her? I was meant to inspire good... ...not madness, not death. You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better. But Rachel, Alfred. Rachel believed in what you stood for... ...what we stand for. Gotham needs you. No, Gotham needs its true hero... ...and I let that murdering psychopath blow him half to hell. Which is why, for now... ...they're gonna have to make do with you. She was gonna wait for me, Alfred. Dent doesn't know. He can never know. What's that? - It can wait. - That bandit... ...in the forest in Burma. - Did you catch him? - Yes. How? We burned the forest down.   He's credible, an M & A lawyer from a leading consultancy. He says he's waited as long as he can for Batman to do the right thing. Now he's taking matters into his own hands. We'll be live at 5 with the true identity of the Batman. I'm sorry about Rachel. The doctor says you're in agonizing pain, but that you won't accept medication. That you're refusing to... ...accept skin grafts. Remember that name... ...you all had for me... ...when I was at Internal Affairs? What was it, Gordon? Harvey, I... Say it. Say it! Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face. Why should I hide who I am? I know you tried to warn me. I'm sorry. Wuertz picked you up. Was he working for them? Do you know who picked up Rachel? Harvey, I need to know which of my men I can trust. Why would you listen to me now? I'm sorry, Harvey. No. No, you're not. Not yet. This craziness, it's too much. Should've thought about that before you let the clown out of the box. MARONl: You want him? I can tell you where he'll be this afternoon. CHECHEN: Not so crazy as you look. I told you, I'm a man of my word. Where is the Italian? All tactical units will converge on the location in 20 minutes. I want auxiliary units to cover all possible getaway routes. CHECHEN: Please. Joker-man, what you do with all your money? You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy... ...dynamite... ...and gunpowder... ...and gasoline. - What the...? - Ah, ah, ah. And you know the thing that they have in common? They're cheap. CALLER 1 : How much are they paying you to say who Batman is? This is our chance. I want Lau alive. The Joker, either way. Hey, Jim. Get a load of this. ENGEL: Let's take the next caller. CALLER 2: Harvey Dent didn 't wanna give in to this maniac. You think you know better? I think that if we could talk to Dent today, he may feel differently. And we wish him a speedy recovery. Because God knows, we need him now. You said you were a man of your word. Oh, I am. I'm only burning my half. All you care about is money. This town deserves a better class of criminal... ...and I'm gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city. They won't work for a freak.  ""Freak.""  Why don't we cut you up into little pieces... ...and feed you to your pooches? Hm? And then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is.  It's not about money... ...it's about sending a message. Everything burns. - Who is this? JOKER: I had a vision... ... of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a little profit... ... and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time. And it was so boring. I've had a change of heart. I don 't want Mr. Reese spoiling everything... ... but why should I have all the fun? Let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn 't dead in 60 minutes... ... then I blow up a hospital. Call in every officer. Tell them to head to their nearest hospital and start evac and search. Call the transit authority, school board, prisons. Get every bus down to a hospital. The priority is Gotham General. Wheel everybody out of that place right now. You, you and you, you come with me. - Where are we going, sir? - To get Reese. I need you plugged in, checking Gordon's men and their families. - Looking for? - Hospital admissions. Will you be wanting the Batpod? In the middle of the day? Not very subtle. The Lamborghini, then. Much more subtle.  Excuse me. Let me through. Excuse me. Okay. Sir, could you help, please? I'm gonna find a bus for him. ENGEL: Sir? Commissioner, do you really think... ...an ordinary citizen would try to kill this man? ENGEL: Sir. Commissioner.  Get the cars around the back! Go. Keep rolling, Sam. I see O'Brien and Richards. No immediate family member admitted to a Gotham hospital. REESE: They're trying to kill me. - Well, maybe Batman can save you. Davis, they got space. Bring him out. Davis. I saw Burns and Zachary. ALFRED: Nothing on them. And a patrolman I don't know. REESE: Okay, so, what now? What do we do now? Where are we going? Send the information to Gordon.  Get out of here. Davis. Ma'am, we're gonna have to move him now. GORDON: It's Berg, isn't it? - Commissioner. You okay, son?   Hi. You know... ...I don't want there to be any hard feelings between us, Harvey. - When you and... - Rachel! - Rachel were being abducted... ...I was sitting in Gordon's cage. I didn't rig those charges. Your men, your plan. Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it. You know? I just do things. The Mob has plans. The cops have plans. Gordon's got plans. You know, they're schemers. Schemers trying to control their little worlds. I'm not a schemer. I try to show the schemers... ...how pathetic their attempts to control things really are. So when I say... Ah. Come here. When I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal... ...you'll know that I'm telling the truth. - I'm gonna need your weapon. - What? Why? Because my wife's in the hospital? Yeah, that'd be why. It's the schemers that put you where you are. You were a schemer, you had plans... ...and look where that got you. ANNOUNCER : Police are taking every precaution... ... urging people not to take matters into their hands. I just did what I do best. I took your little plan and I turned it on itself. Look what I did to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets. Hm? You know what I noticed? Nobody panics when things go ""according to plan."" Even if the plan is horrifying. If tomorrow I tell the press that, like, a gangbanger will get shot... ...or a truckload of soldiers will be blowing up... ...nobody panics. Because it's all part of the plan. But when I say that one little old mayor will die... ...well, then, everyone loses their minds. Introduce a little anarchy... ...upset the established order... ...and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair. - You live. - Mm-hm. You die. Mmm. Now we're talking. Mr. Reese. That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it? - That was a very brave thing you did. - Trying to catch the light? - You weren't protecting the van? - Why? Who's in it? Don't you think I should go to the hospital? Don't watch a whole lot of news, do you, Mr. Wayne?   Southeast. It's Gotham General. - Did you clear the building? OFFICER: Yeah. GORDON: You must know how many were inside. You have patient lists, roll call. Right now we're showing 50 people missing. One bus. The other buses were heading off to hospitals. I guess we missed one. What's your guess about where Harvey Dent is? Keep looking. And keep it to yourself. Anybody asks, we got him out. Get me the mayor's office on the line. We're gonna need the National Guard. REPORTER : - people are still missing... ... including GCN's own Mike Engel. I'm now being told that we're cutting to a video GCN has just received. I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight. ""What does it take to make you people wanna join in? You failed to kill the lawyer. I've gotta get you off the bench... ...and into the game. JOKER: Bench. Game.  ENGEL: Come nightfall, this city is mine. JOKER: Mine. - And anyone left here plays by my rules. - Rules. Mr. Fox? Security is showing a break-in at the R & D Department. If you don 't wanna be in the game... ...get out now. - Get out now.  But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd are sure in for a surprise. Ha-ha, ha-ha. ""    REPORTER: Gotham P.D. has shut down... BARTENDER: Sweet Jesus. ...the area 's bridges and tunnels. Shouldn't you be out there, you know, doing something? It's my day off. I gotta take a leak. Keep an eye out for me, will you?  Now what? Need someone to shake it for you? DENT: Hello. Dent. Jesus. I thought you was dead. Half. Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz? - It must've been Maroni's men. - Shut up! Are you telling me that you're gonna protect... ...the other traitor in Gordon's unit? I don't know, he never told me. Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't know what they were gonna do to you. That's funny... ...because I don't know what's gonna happen to you either.  Beautiful, isn't it? Beautiful. Unethical. Dangerous. You've turned every cell phone in Gotham into a microphone. BATMAN: And a high-frequency generator-receiver. You took my sonar concept and applied it to every phone in the city. With half the city feeding you sonar, you can image all of Gotham. This is wrong. I've gotta find this man, Lucius. At what cost? The database is null-key encrypted. It can only be accessed by one person. This is too much power for one person. That's why I gave it to you. Only you can use it. Spying on 30 million people isn't part of my job description. This is an audio sample. If he talks within range of any phone in the city... ...you can triangulate his position. I'll help you this one time. But consider this my resignation. As long as this machine is at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be. When you're finished... ...type in your name.  GORDON: My officers are going over every inch of the tunnels and bridges... ...but with the Joker's threat, they're not an option. - And land routes east? - Backed up for hours. Which leaves the ferries with 30,000 ready to board. I wanna use the ferries so I can get those prisoners off the island. The men you put away? Those aren't people I'm worried about. You should be. Whatever the Joker's planning... ...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are involved. I wanna get them out of here. So where is Harvey? - We haven't found him. - Oh, Jesus. How long can you keep this quiet? Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing. Going to join your wife? - You love her? - Yes. You ever imagine what it would be like to listen to her die? Look, take it up with the Joker. He killed your woman. He made you... ...like this. The Joker's just a mad dog. I want whoever let him off the leash. I took care of Wuertz, but who was your other man inside Gordon's unit? Who picked up Rachel? Must have been someone she trusted. Look, if I tell you... ...will you let me go? Can't hurt your chances. It was Ramirez.  - But you said... - I said it couldn't hurt your chances. You're a lucky man. - But he's not. - Who? Your driver.  GUARDSMAN 1: Stand back. Hey, that ain't right. We should be on that boat. GUARDSMAN 2: You wanna ride across with them? Be my guest.  FIRST MATE: Sir, they've stopped their engines. Right, get on the radio. Tell them we'll come back and pick them up once we dump the scumbags. Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.  CAPTAIN: What the heck was that?  MAN: What the...? CAPTAIN : Liberty, come in, please. This is Spirit. Come in. Liberty, we have the same thing. We've lost both engines. - Liberty, come in. BATMAN: Fox. There's something going on on the ferries. Get down to the engine room now. MAN: Hey, buddy, what's happening? Captain, we got a hundred barrels down there rigged to blow. And this. CAPTAIN: Oh, my God. FIRST MATE: Looks like some kind of detonator. CAPTAIN: Why would they give us the detonator to our own bomb?  JOKER : Tonight, you're all gonna... ... be a part of a social experiment. Through the magic of diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate... ... I'm ready right now to blow you all sky-high. Liberty, come in, over. It's dead. JOKER: If anyone attempts to get off their boat, you all die. FOX: I'm zeroing in. JOKER: Each of you has a remote to blow up the other boat. His voice is on the ferry... ...but it's not the source. West.  - Gordon. BATMAN: I have the Joker's location. Prewitt Building. Assemble on the building opposite. At midnight, I blow you all up. lf, however, one of you presses the button, I'll let that boat live. So who 's it gonna be? Harvey Dent's most-wanted scumbag collection... ... or the sweet and innocent civilians? You choose. Oh, and you might wanna decide quickly... ... because the people on the other boat may not be quite so noble.   Stay back. Well, now, who are you to decide? We ought to talk this over, at least. We don't all have to die. Those men had their chance. - We are not going to talk about this. - Why aren't we talking about it? They're talking over the same thing on the other boat. - Let's put it to a vote. CROWD: Yes!   - Hello? RAMIREZ: Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez. Jim needs you to pack up and put the kids in the car right away. But the units outside... Those cops can 't be trusted. Jim needs you away from them as soon as possible. I'll call them off for 10 minutes, and you'll have to move fast. - But where am I supposed to take them? - 25052nd Street. Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out. Okay. She believe you? It's because she trusts you... ...just like Rachel did. - I didn't know... - Didn't know what they'd do? You're the second cop to say that to me. What exactly did you think they were gonna do? They got me early on. My mother's hospital bills... - Don't! - I'm sorry. You live to fight another day, officer. SWAT LEADER: We found the missing hospital bus. GORDON: Then we have a hostage situation. It's a shooting gallery. Why would he choose a spot with such big windows? SWAT LEADER: We have clear shots on five clowns. Snipers take them out, smash the windows, a team rappels in. Team moves in by the stairwells. Two, three casualties max. - Let's do it. BATMAN: It's not that simple. - With the Joker, it never is. - What's simple is... ...every second, those people on the ferries get closer to blowing... - That won't happen. - Then he'll blow both of them up! - We don't have time for paper ballots. - I want everybody to put their votes... ...on this piece of paper. If anyone's got pens, pass it along. GUARDSMAN: Thank you. Anybody else? Coming through. Anybody else? Thank you. COMMANDER: We need to get these votes in quickly. Come on. PRISONER 1: What are you waiting for? Push the button! PRISONER 2: We're running out of time! I need five minutes alone. No! There's no time! We have clear shots! Dent is in there with them. We have to save Dent! I have to save Dent. Get ready. Two minutes, then we breach.  Fox, I need picture.  - Hello? BARBARA: Jim, we're in trouble. FOX: Okay, you got POV on alpha... ... omni on beta. Looks like clowns and hostages on two floors. There's a SWA T team on the stairwell. Another SWA T team on the roof. TEAM LEADER: Line's clear. - Barbara, calm down. - He has the kids! DENT: Hello, Jim. - Harvey? - Where's my family? - Where my family died.  SWAT LEADER: Blue team, acquire the target. Entry team, set your charge.  BATMAN: Fox, the SWA Ts are targeting the wrong people. The clowns are the hostages. Red team, go! Red team, go! Entry team, blow and go! Don't move. SWAT LEADER: Take the shot. FOX: Those SWA Ts are coming in hot. SWAT 1: Clowns, put down your guns. SWAT 2: Drop your weapons! SWAT 3: On the ground, now! SWAT 4: Doctors, get down! Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap...   SWAT 5: Freeze! Stand down or you will be... FOX: Look up. See those bad guys on the floor above? They're waiting to ambush the SWA T team coming up the elevator. SWAT LEADER: Sixty seconds. The tally is 140 against, 396 for.  So go ahead. Do it. We're still here. And that means they haven't killed us yet either. TEAM LEADER: Go, go, go! Blue team, cover!  Uh-oh.  FOX: Trouble on the floor above. SWAT 6: Get down on the ground now!  SWAT 7: Freeze! Stop or we will shoot. SWAT 8: We will shoot you. Drop the officer. Release the officer right now. SWAT 9: Let him go now! On your knees! PILOT: We got him. He's out of the game. SWAT 9: Keep your hands in the air! SWAT 8: Step away from the edge!   SWAT 10: Halt! SWAT 11: Stay down! SWAT 12: Don't move! SWAT LEADER: Be advised. Clowns are hostages, doctors are targets.  Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled. - Where's the detonator? - Go get him.    SWAT 13: Put down your weapon! SWAT 14: Don't move!  You don't wanna die... ...but you don't know how to take a life. Give it to me. These men will kill you and take it anyway. No one wants to get their hands dirty. Fine. I'll do it. Those men on that boat? They made their choices. They chose to murder and steal. It doesn't make any sense for us to have to die too. All the old familiar places. FOX: Stand by.  SWAT 2: Red team, floor secure. Hostages are safe. Give it to me. You can tell them I took it by force. Give it to me, and I'll do what you should've did 10 minutes ago.  We really should stop this fighting, otherwise we'll miss the fireworks. There won't be any fireworks. And here we go. What were you trying to prove? That deep down, everyone's as ugly as you? You're alone. Can't rely on anyone these days. You gotta do everything yourself. Don't we? That's okay. I came prepared. It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of which, you know how I got these scars? No, but I know how you got these.   Oh, you. You just couldn't let me go, could you? This is what happens when an unstoppable force... ...meets an immovable object. You truly are incorruptible, aren't you? Huh? You won't kill me... ...out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness. And I won't kill you... ...because you're just too much fun. I think you and I are destined to do this forever. You'll be in a padded cell forever. Maybe we could share one. You know, they'll be doubling up... ...the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds. This city just showed you... ...that it's full of people ready to believe in good. Until their spirit breaks completely. Until they get a good look at the real Harvey Dent... ...and all the heroic things he's done. You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle for Gotham's soul... ...in a fistfight with you? No. You need an ace in the hole. Mine's Harvey. What did you do? I took Gotham's white knight... ...and I brought him down to our level. It wasn't hard. See, madness, as you know... ...is like gravity. All it takes is a little push.  Dent! DENT: This is where they brought her, Gordon, after your men handed her over. This is where she died. I know, I was here... ...trying to save her. - But you didn't. - I couldn't. - Yes, you could've. If you'd listened to me. If you stood up against corruption... ...instead of doing your deal with the devil. I was trying to fight the Mob! You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself if you knew what I'd lost. Have you ever had to talk to the person you loved most... ...tell them it's gonna be all right, when you know it's not? Well, you're about to know what that feels like, Gordon. Then you can look me in the eye and tell me you're sorry. - You're not going to hurt my family. - No. Just the person you love most.  So is it your wife? Put the gun down, Harvey. Harvey, put down the gun. Please. Please, Harvey. Please. Oh, goddamn it. Will you stop pointing that gun at my family? BARBARA: No! - We have a winner. No, Jim, stop him! GORDON: Harvey. BARBARA: Don't let him... Harvey!  I'm sorry! For everything. Please don't hurt my son.   You brought your cops? All they know is there's a situation. They don't know who or what. They're just creating a perimeter. You think I wanna escape from this? There is no escape from this. You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey. It's not about what I want, it's about what's fair! You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time. But you were wrong. The world is cruel. And the only morality in a cruel world... ...is chance. Unbiased. Unprejudiced. Fair. His son's got the same chance she had. Fifty-fifty. What happened to Rachel wasn't chance. We decided to act. We three. Then why was it me who was the only one who lost everything? - It wasn't. - The Joker chose me. Because you were the best of us. He wanted to prove that even someone as good as you... ...could fall. And he was right. You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey. So point it at the people responsible. Fair enough. You first. My turn. Harvey, you're right. Rachel's death was my fault. Please don't punish the boy. - Please, punish me. - I'm about to. Tell your boy he's gonna be all right, Gordon. Lie... ...like I lied. It's going to be all right, son.   Dad? Daddy, is he okay?  - Thank you. - You don't have to thank me. Yes, I do. The Joker won. Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for... ...undone. Whatever chance you gave us at fixing our city dies with Harvey's reputation. We bet it all on him. The Joker took the best of us and tore him down. People will lose hope. They won't. They must never know what he did. Five dead. Two of them cops. - You can't sweep that... - No. But the Joker cannot win. Gotham needs its true hero. - No. - You either die a hero... ...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I can do those things... ...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent. I killed those people. That's what I can be. No, no, you can't. You're not. I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be. Call it in. GORDON: A hero. Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed. Nothing less than a knight... ...shining. GORDON: They'll hunt you. BATMAN: You'll hunt me. You'll condemn me. Set the dogs on me. Because that's what needs to happen. Because sometimes... ... the truth isn 't good enough. Sometimes people deserve more. Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.  JAMES: Batman. Batman! Why's he running, Dad? Because we have to chase him. Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move! He didn't do anything wrong.  Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him... ... because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian... ...a watchful protector. A dark knight., M doesn't mind you earning a little money on the side, Dryden. She'd just prefer it if it wasn't selling secrets. If the theatrics are supposed to scare me... ...you have the wrong man, Bond. If M was so sure that I was bent... ...she'd have sent a double-0. Benefits of being section chief... ...I'd know if anyone had been promoted to double-0 status... ...wouldn't I? - Your file shows no kills, and it takes... - Two. Shame. We barely got to know each other. I know where you keep your gun. I suppose that's something. True. How did he die? Your contact? Not well. Made you feel it, did he? Well... ...you needn't worry. The second is... Yes. Considerably. So how do I trust this man that I've never met with my money? You asked for the introduction. That's all my organization will guarantee. I suppose our friend Mr. White will have told you... ...that I have provided reliable banking services... ...for many other freedom fighters over the years. Do you believe in God, Mr. Le Chiffre? No. I believe in a reasonable rate of return. I want no risk in the portfolio. Agreed. And I can access it anywhere in the world? Yes. I have the money, so short another million shares... ... of Skyfleet stock. Sir, you must know you're betting against the market. No one expects this stock to go anywhere but up. Just do it. Looks like our man. Burn scars on his face. I wonder if bomb-makers are insured for things like that. He's on the move. He's on the move, and he's heading straight for me. Stop touching your ear. - Sorry? - Put your hand down. Holster the bloody weapon, Carter. I need him alive. Weeping blood comes merely from a derangement of the tear duct... ...my dear general. Nothing sinister. All in. I have two pair, and you have a 17.4 percent chance... ...of making your straight. When does Ellipsis expire? - We have less than 36 hours. I can... - No. No, no. That's all the time I have anyway. Give our guests five minutes to leave... ...or throw them overboard. Who the hell do they think they are? I report to the prime minister, even he's smart enough... ...not to ask me what we do. Have you ever seen such a bunch of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs? They don't care what we do, they care what we get photographed doing. And how the hell could Bond be so stupid? I give him double-0 status, he celebrates by shooting an embassy. Is the man deranged? And where the hell is he? In the old days, if an agent did something embarrassing... ...he'd have the good sense to defect. Christ, I miss the Cold War. You've got a bloody cheek. Sorry. I'll shoot the camera first next time. Or yourself. You stormed into an embassy. You violated the only absolutely inviolate rule... ...of international relationships. And why? So you could kill a nobody. We wanted to question him, not kill him. For God's sake. You're supposed to display some kind of judgment. I did. I thought one less bomb-maker in the world would be good. Exactly. One bomb-maker. We're trying to find out how an entire network of terrorist groups is financed... ...and you give us one bomb-maker. Hardly the big picture, wouldn't you say? The man isn't even a true believer. He's a gun for hire. And thanks to your trigger finger... ...we have no idea who hired him or why. And how the hell did you find out where I lived? The same way I found out your name. I thought ""M"" was randomly assigned. I had no idea it stood for... Utter one more syllable and I'll have you killed. I knew it was too early to promote you. Well, I understand double-0s have a very short life-expectancy... ...so your mistake will be short-lived. Bond, this may be too much for a blunt instrument to understand... ...but arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand. So you want me to be half monk, half hit-man? Any thug can kill. I want you to take your ego out of the equation... ...and to judge the situation dispassionately. I have to know I can trust you, and that you know who to trust. And since I don't know that, I need you out of my sight. Go and stick your head in the sand somewhere... ...and think about your future. Because these bastards want your head. And I'm seriously considering feeding you to them. And Bond... ...don't ever break into my house again. Ma'am. Good day, sir, and welcome to the Ocean Club. Hey. Hey. Hello. Are you going to take this or make me wait? Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir. Security to car park. Security to car park. Absolutely incredible. Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir. Checking in? Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment thing, and I haven't got a reservation. Okay. - We have an ocean-view villa. - Perfect. Could you do me a favor? I was here last night... ...and I parked my car next to a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin. I nicked the door. You wouldn't happen to know...? - Mr. Dimitrios. - Right. If he hasn't noticed, I'm not sure I'd mention it. Isn't the type to take bad news well. But if I felt compelled to find him? He has a house just up the beach. Thank you. - What? - He's in the Bahamas. You woke me to share his holiday plans? Well, he's logged into our secure website... ...using your name and password. Well, how the hell does he know these things? Well, I'm doing my best to find out. - Who's he looking at? - Alex Dimitrios. That slimy bugger. Now known associates... Le Chiffre. We've had a good night, we've had a few drinks. How can I assist you, sir? Good evening. Large Mount Gay with soda, please. - Look what just happened. - Good job, big boy. Yeah. Do you mind if I join? - Oh, good evening. How are you? - Good evening. Small blind, big blind. I'm in. Bet's to you. If that was for luck, you're two hours late. Two hundred to you. Bet's to you. I heard you. Five to call. - Action's to you. - Pair of sevens. Ace high. Check or bet. - Check. - And to you. Five thousand. Five to call. - Check. - Check to you, sir. All in. No, wait. Twenty thousand. Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir. Okay. This is on the table. That's my car. Wanna bet? I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios. Please, no. Give him a chance to win his money back. All right, show me, gentlemen. Three kings. There you go with my night. Trip aces. Aces win. Oh, and the valet ticket. Thank you. Sir. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. No wonder he was in such a foul mood. My mistake. Can I give you a lift home? That would really send him over the edge. I'm afraid I'm not that cruel. Well, perhaps you're just out of practice. Perhaps. Well, what about a drink at my place? Your place? - Is it close? - Very. One drink. Good evening, sir, and welcome back. Welcome to my home. I'm having a hard time seeing how this is my fault. It's your plan. All I did was get you the man. A man who was under surveillance by the British Secret Service. Which makes me wonder if I can trust you at all. Then don't. I couldn't care less. But I do care about my reputation. I have someone else willing to do the job. He just needs the particulars... ...and payment. You like married women, don't you, James? It keeps things simple. What is it about bad men? You, my husband... I had so many chances to be happy... ...so many nice guys. Why can't nice guys be more like you? Well, because then they'd be bad. Yes. But so much more interesting. What makes your husband a bad man? His nature, I suppose. The nature of his work? A mystery, I'm afraid. I'm also afraid you will sleep with me in order to get to him. How afraid? Not enough to stop. Can I ask you a personal question? Now would seem an appropriate time. Does ""ellipsis"" mean anything to you? Should I ask him about it? Perhaps later. Yes, dear? I'm on the last flight tonight to Miami. Don't wait up. I'll be back in the morning. Okay, I understand. See you tomorrow. Bye-bye. Apparently he's on the last flight to Miami... ...so you have all night to question me. In that case... ...we're gonna need... ...some more champagne. Good evening. Room Service. Good evening. Can I get a bottle of chilled Bollinger Grand Anne... ...and the beluga caviar? - With everything? - Yes, with everything. - And would that be for two, sir? - What? - For two? - No, for one. Wait here. There you go. Number 53. Dr. Von Hagens' Body Worlds invites visitors... ... to observe the body's various locomotive, digestive... ... nervous and vascular systems. Please may I have your attention, ladies and gentlemen? I believe it is something very special, what we see here. This is edutainment. - fixed in dramatic and athletic poses... ... that reveal the true-to-life spatial relationships amongst organs. Hello. Hello. Do not leave your vehicle unattended. Welcome to Miami International Airport. Curbside parking in front of the terminal is restricted... - Yes. - It's Bond. I need her now. I'm afraid she can't be disturbed. Can I take a message? Listen, you go and find her, tell her to call Security at Miami Airport... ...because I think a bomb is about to go off. Do it now. - Sorry, can I put you on hold? - I thought you might. Bond? What the hell are you up to? I'll call you back. - The Skyfleet S570 prototype. - What about it? ""The largest airplane in the world will be unveiled today at Miami Airport."" Oh, my God! Bond? Bond! His target is the Skyfleet prototype. It's launching today. I gotta go. Stop! Stop! Get moving! Let's go, let's go, let's go! The puts expired. I'm sorry, I'm not sure yet how much you've lost. One hundred and one million, two hundred and six thousand dollars. Someone talked. - You got everything you need? - Yeah, I have. I'm gonna get a few more photos... Quite the body count you're stacking up. She was tortured first. As you'd already killed her husband... ...she must have been the only one left to question. Did she know anything that could compromise you? No. - Not your name, what you were after? - No. Dimitrios worked as a middleman. Knew where to put his hands on weapons... ...and people who could use them. He worked with anyone who had money. For years he was involved with a man we knew as Le Chiffre... ...a private banker to the world's terrorists. He invested their money, gave them access to it wherever they wanted. Oh, good. You're here. Albanian, we believe. Chess prodigy. A bit of a mathematical genius and liked to prove it by playing poker. So you can keep an eye on me? Yes. When they analyzed the stock market after 9l11... ...the CIA discovered a massive shorting of airline stocks. When the stocks hit bottom on 9l12, somebody made a fortune. The same thing happened this morning with Skyfleet stock... ...or was supposed to. With their prototype destroyed, the company would be near bankruptcy. Instead, somebody lost over $ 100 million betting the wrong way. You think it's this man Le Chiffre. Which would explain how he could set up a high-stakes poker game... ...at Casino Royale in Montenegro. Ten players, $ 10 million buy-in, 5 million re-buy. Winner takes all. Potentially 150 million. Good. Then we'll know where he'll be. Do you want a clean kill or to send a message? We want him alive. Le Chiffre doesn't have 100 million to lose. Has he been playing the stock market with his clients' funds? They're not gonna be too happy when they find out it's gone. We can't let him win this game. If he loses, he'll have nowhere to run. We'll give him sanctuary in return for everything he knows. I'm putting you in the game... ...replacing someone who's playing for a syndicate. According to Villiers, you're the best player in the Service. Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case. I would ask you if you could remain emotionally detached... ...but I don't think that's your problem, is it, Bond? No. Don't worry about keeping in touch. We'll know where you are. You can stop pretending. You knew I wouldn't let this drop, didn't you? Well, I knew you were you. Thank you. I'm the money. Every penny of it. The Treasury has agreed to stake you in the game. ""Vesper."" Well, I do hope you gave your parents hell for that. Thank you. Your boss must be well-connected. I've never seen so much go out the door so quickly. Or quite so stylishly. May I ask you where it is? Ten million was wired to your account in Montenegro... ...with a contingency for 5 more if I deem it a prudent investment. I suppose you've given some thought to the notion that if you lose... ...our government will have directly financed terrorism. What looks good? So you're telling me it's a matter of probability and odds. I was worried there was some chance involved. Well, only if you assume the player with the best hand wins. So that would be what you call ""bluffing""? You've heard the term. Then you'll also know that in poker you never play your hand. You play the man across from you. - And you're good at reading people? - Yes, I am. Which is why I've been able to detect... ...an undercurrent of sarcasm in your voice. I'm now assured our money is in good hands. You don't think this is a very good plan, do you? So there is a plan? I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars... ...and hundreds of lives on a game of luck. What else can you surmise, Mr. Bond? About you, Miss Lynd? Well, your beauty's a problem. You worry you won't be taken seriously. Which one can say of any attractive woman with half a brain. True, but this one overcompensates... ...by wearing slightly masculine clothing... ...being more aggressive than her female colleagues... ...which gives her a somewhat prickly demeanor... ...and ironically enough, makes it less likely for her to be accepted... ...and promoted by her male superiors... ...who mistake her insecurities for arrogance. Now, I'd have normally gone with only child... ...but, you see, by the way you ignored the quip about your parents... ...I'm gonna have to go with orphan. All right. By the cut of your suit, you went to Oxford or wherever... ...and actually think human beings dress like that. But you wear it with such disdain... ...my guess is you didn't come from money... ...and your school friends never let you forget it. Which means you were at that school by the grace... ...of someone else's charity, hence the chip on your shoulder. And since your first thought about me ran to orphan... ...that's what I'd say you are. Oh, you are. I like this poker thing. And that makes perfect sense... ...since Ml6 looks for maladjusted young men... ...that give little thought to sacrificing others... ...in order to protect Queen and country. You know... ...former SAS types with easy smiles and expensive watches. - Rolex? - Omega. Beautiful. Now, having just met you... ...I wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold-hearted bastard. No, of course not. But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine. You think of women as disposable pleasures... ...rather than meaningful pursuits. So as charming as you are, Mr. Bond... ...I will be keeping my eye on our government's money... ...and off your perfectly formed arse. You noticed? Even accountants have imagination. How was your lamb? Skewered. One sympathizes. Good evening, Mr. Bond. Good evening, Miss Lynd. - Hotel Splendid, sir? - That's right. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. It's just last-minute details. Apparently we're very much in love. Do you usually leave it to porters to tell you this sort of thing? Only when the romance has been necessarily brief. I'm Mr. Arlington Beech, professional gambler... ...and you're Miss Stephanie Broadchest... - I am not. - You're gonna have to trust me on this. Oh, no, I don't. We've been involved for quite a while... ...hence the shared suite. But my family is strict Roman Catholic... ...so for appearances' sake, it'll be a two-bedroom suite. I do hate it when religion comes between us. Religion and a securely locked door. Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond? No, don't worry. You're not my type. Smart? Single. Welcome to the Hotel Splendid. Your name, sir? James Bond. You'll find the reservation under Beech. - Welcome, Mr. Bond. - You sign that, dear. You represent the Treasury. Thank you. Enjoy your stay. I will. Thank you. Very funny. Look, if Le Chiffre is that well-connected... ...he knows who I am and where the money's from. Which means he's decided to play me anyway. So he's either desperate or he's overly confident... ...but either way, that tells me something about him. And all he gets in return is a name he already has. And now he knows something about you. He knows you're reckless. Take the next one. There isn't enough room for me and your ego. Mr. Bond? - It was left for you. - Thank you. I love you too, M. My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis. I'm your contact here. Does he know we've been watching him? Le Chiffre? I don't think so. Probably because there's no ""we."" Just me. I'm afraid if you get into trouble here... ...the cavalry won't be coming over the nearest hill. Le Chiffre arrived yesterday... ...and spent the time reestablishing old relationships. The chief of police and he are now quite close. That's him, with the mustache. Over my left shoulder. Well, that could make life quite difficult. Yeah, and quite possibly shorter. He's not a very subtle man. I thought about trying to buy his services, but we frankly... ...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre. I hate to say it... ...but the accountants seem to be running Ml6 these days. Oh, not that I have anything against accountants. Many of them are lovely people. So I decided that it was cheaper to supply his deputy... ...with evidence that we were bribing the chief. It's amazing what you can do with Photoshop these days, isn't it? I think your odds are improving, Mr. Bond. Yes? For you. Something you expect me to wear? I need you looking fabulous. So when you walk up behind me and kiss me on the neck... ...the players will be thinking about your neckline... ...and not about their cards. Do you think you can do that for me? I'll do my best. Thank you. I have a dinner jacket. There are dinner jackets and dinner jackets. This is the latter. And I need you looking like a man who belongs at that table. How...? It's tailored. I sized you up the moment we met. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Thank you. And you must be Mr. Bliss' replacement. Welcome, Mr. Beech. Or is that Bond? I'm a little confused. Well, we wouldn't want that, would we? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. As you know, the game is no-limit hold 'em poker. Five communal cards, two in the hole. Monsieur Mendel here represents the Basel Bank, Switzerland... ...holding the stakes. You have each deposited $ 10 million buy-in. A further buy-in of 5 million can be made by electronic transfer. The money will remain in escrow until I return... ...and the winner of the contest enters his or her password... ...into the encryptor... ...whereupon the entire sum will be wired... ...to any bank account in the world you nominate. Mr. Bond? We proceed alphabetically. Please be so kind as to enter a password of your choice. Six letters or more. High card for dealer position. It's Signor Gallardo. Mr. Kaminofsky is the small blind, $5000... ...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind, Well, enjoy the game. Four players. It's your bet. Check. Check. Bet. Fifty thousand. Call. Fold. Fold. Heads up. Monsieur Le Chiffre. Bet. One hundred thousand. Weren't you supposed to enter so the others could see you? Was I? Forgive me. Good luck, darling. It's up to you, Monsieur Bond. Monsieur Bond? Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet? A hundred thousand? Call. Hello. I suppose I don't have to tell you how beautiful you look. Half the people at that table are still watching you. Champagne. Monsieur Le Chiffre. Bet. Two hundred thousand. Monsieur, you have been called. Showdown, please. A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre. Deuces full of nines. Mr. Bond? Fold. Send the barman over, please. A dry martini. Wait. Three measures Gordon's, one of vodka... ...half of Kina Lillet, shake it over ice... ...then add a thin slice of lemon peel. - Yes, sir. - You know, I'll have one of those. - So will I. Certainly. My friend, bring me one as well. Keep the fruit. That's it? Anyone want to play poker now? Someone's in a hurry. Would you excuse me? You taste nice. - I thought we dispensed with covers. - No. We dispensed with one that was of no use and created another that is. - Is he watching? - Yes. Good. This is me in character pissed off because you're losing so fast... ...we won't be here past midnight. Oddly, my character's feelings mirror my own. Check. - You know, that's not half bad. - Up to you. I'm gonna have to think up a name for that. It was worth it to discover his tell. What do you mean? The twitch he has to hide when he bluffs. - Bluffs? He had the best hand. - Which he got on the last card. The odds against were 23-to-1, and he'd know that. When he did his first raise he had nothing. Winning was blind luck. - Did you get the bug? - Yes. Bet. One hundred thousand. Thank you. It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu. Maybe he can actually pull this off. Call. Monsieur Le Chiffre. Ladies and gentlemen, Mesdames, Messieurs... ...we've now been playing for four hours. It's time for a short break. We will resume play in one hour. Well, I think I'll report on the evening's frivolities. So? You want to do what to me? You've lost me completely. You just said you can't wait to get me back to the room. Come on. So, what's so damn important? I'm sorry. Where is my money? - Good evening. - Good evening. You're holding a parcel for me. Thank you. Do you think you can lose that kind of money and no one would notice? Your money is safe. Open that. You'll have it tomorrow. All of it. I would take a hand for this betrayal, but you need it to play cards. Hold out your arm. Hold out your arm, my beauty... ...or I will take your head. Go to the room. Wait for me there. Stairs. Not a word of protest. You should find a new boyfriend. Go find Mathis. Tell him I've hidden the bodies here and I want him to get rid of them. Do that now. Go. Go, go! You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond. I hope our little game isn't causing you to perspire. A little. But I won't consider myself to be in trouble until I start weeping blood. Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's ready, let's continue the game. It's like there's blood on my hands. It's not coming off. Here, let's see. That's better. You cold? Yeah. Here. You have any trouble with the bodies? Less than some. Being dead doesn't mean one can't still be helpful. That'll keep Le Chiffre looking over his shoulder. He'll be wondering who's gonna come for him next. How's our girl? Melted your cold heart yet? Call. Fold. And call. Three players. Three hundred grand. Bet. Three hundred thousand. Call. And call. Three players. Check. Monsieur Bond? Bet. Five hundred thousand. Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing. My God, James was right. It's up to you. Raise. One million. Seems someone knows something I don't. Fold. Heads up, gentlemen. It's up to you. Two. Re-raise. Two million. And it's up to you. I'm all in. Well, it's 14 million and 500,000. It's up to you, Monsieur Bond. Bond will have to go all in to call his bluff. - Call. - Call. Gentlemen, showdown, please. Full house. Kings and aces. Monsieur Le Chiffre. It's four jacks. Monsieur Le Chiffre wins. You must have thought I was bluffing, Mr. Bond. Please. We will now break for one hour. When we return, the big blind will be 200,000. Good game. Well, I'm gonna need the other 5 million to buy back in. I can't do that, James. Look, I made a mistake. I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant, but I can beat him. - I'm sorry. - Sorry? Sorry? Try putting that in a sentence. ""Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win... ...continue funding terror and killing."" That kind of sorry? You lost because of your ego, and that same ego can't take it. That's what this is about. All you're going to do now is lose more. Then you're an idiot. - I'm sorry? - I said, you're a bloody idiot. Look in my eyes. I can beat this man, you know that. Get your hand off my arm. Vodka martini. - Shaken or stirred? - Do I look like I give a damn? - James. - Get the girl out. Funny game, right? Sorry, I should've introduced myself, seeing as we're related. Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley. You should have a little faith. If you keep your head about you, I think you have him. Had. Excuse me. You're not buying in? No. Listen, I'm bleeding chips. I'm not gonna last much longer. You have a better chance. I'll stake you. I'm saying I'll give you the money to keep going. Just one thing. If you pull it off, the CIA bring him in. And what about the winnings? Does it look like we need the money? Shall we up the blinds? Why not? Bet. Raise. And fold. Excuse me, please. Call. Raise. Raise. Five hundred thousand. - Fold. - Thank you. Fold. Fold. Thank you. Wins. Deal me out. Sorry, sir. You are the big blind. Small blind, please. - Who is it? - It's 007. Bond's been poisoned. He's going into cardiac arrest. Stay calm and don't interrupt. Because you'll be dead... ...within two minutes unless you do exactly what I tell you. I'm all ears. Remove the defibrillator from the pouch. - Do we know what it is yet? - We're still scanning. Attach the leads to your chest. Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis. What do we give him? The kit has amphetamines, antihistamines... ... hydrocortisone. Adrenalin? - As soon as it reads charged... - Lidocaine. That'll work. Bond, don't push the red button yet. Do you hear me? Don't push it. His heart's gonna stop. There's only time for one charge before he passes out. Take the blue combipen, Bond. Mid-neck into the vein. That'll counteract the digitalis. You're going to pass out in a few seconds. You need to keep your heart going. Push the red button now, Bond. - Bond, push the damn button! - Do it now! - You okay? - Me? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Now get yourself off to a hospital. - I will do. As soon as I've won this game. You're not seriously going back there? I wouldn't dream of it. Bet. One million. - All in. - Call. All in. Gentlemen, showdown, please. Two pair. Aces and sevens. Queen plays. Wins. Oh, I'm sorry. That last hand, it nearly killed me. Gentlemen, with this chip exchange, we enter the final phase of the game... ...which means no more buy-ins. The big blind is now 1 million dollars. Four players. It's your bet. - Monsieur Bond? - Check. - Check. - Twenty-four million in the pot already. Check. And check. All check. Four players. - Check. - Check. All in. Six million. Bet. Six million. All in. Five million. All in. Bet is 6 million. Raise. Raise. Twelve million. Heads up. Forty million, 500,000. All in. Raise. All in. Well, I think I will call you on that one. Call. One hundred and fifteen million in the pot. Gentlemen, showdown, please. Flush. Ace, king, queen. Full house. Eights full of aces. A higher full house. Aces full of sixes. Monsieur Bond. Five and seven of spades. A straight flush. Four to the eight. The high hand. Monsieur Bond wins. - For you. - Thank you very much. Congratulations. - He's all yours. - Much appreciated, brother. Congratulations. You know, I think a celebration's in order. You were almost dead an hour ago. Come on, I'm famished. Thank you. Mathis says the Americans have made contact with Le Chiffre. They're going to extract him before dawn. You know, I think I'll call that a Vesper. Because of the bitter aftertaste? No. Because once you've tasted it, that's all you want to drink. - I thought that was quite a good line. - It was a very good line. But you're laughing at it. - Not so much it as you. - Well, that's fine then. I figured out what that is. It's an Algerian love knot. Really? I thought it was just something pretty. No, you didn't. Someone gave that to you. He's a very lucky man. You can switch off so easily, can't you? It doesn't bother you, killing those people? Well, I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did. I don't believe you. You've got a choice, you know? Just because you've done something... ...doesn't mean you have to keep doing it. Why is it people who can't take advice always insist on giving it? You think I can't take my own advice? I think something is driving you. And I think I'll never find out what that is. Mathis needs me. Good night. Congratulations again. Mathis. I'm afraid your friend Mathis is really... ...my friend Mathis. You've taken good care of your body. Such a waste. You know... ...I never understood all these elaborate tortures. It's the simplest thing... ...to cause more pain than a man can possibly endure. And of course... ...it's not only the immediate agony, but the knowledge... ...that if you do not yield soon enough... ...there will be little left to identify you as a man. The only question remains... ...will you yield in time? I want the money. Miss Lynd will give me the account number, if she hasn't already. So all I need from you is the password. The password, please. I've got a little itch... ...down there. Would you mind? No! No! No! No. To the right. To the right. To the right! You are a funny man, Mr. Bond. Yeah! Yes, yes, yes. Now the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls. I died? - I died? - Yes. Because no matter what you do, I'm not gonna give you the password. Which means your clients will hunt you down... ...and cut you into pieces of meat while you're still breathing. Because if you kill me... ...there'll be nowhere else to hide. But you are so wrong! Because even after I slaughtered you and your little girlfriend... ...your people would still welcome me with open arms... ...because they need what I know. The big picture. Give me the password... ...and I will at least let her live. Bond. Do it soon enough and she might even be in one piece. You really aren't going to tell me, are you? No. So I think... ...I'll feed you what you seem not to value. I'll get the money. Tell them I'll get the money. Money isn't as valuable to our organization as knowing who to trust. Francesco. Francesco. Vesper. Vesper. No. Not him. Not Mathis. No. I'll get the doctor. Not him. Any ideas? - What? - Why they left the two of you alive. Where is she? Sleeping. Well, I'm supposed to get you to drink this. It's just odd... ...killing everyone else but leaving you and her untouched. Almost as if someone was trying to tell us something. Get a look at the killer? No. Shame. Drink up. Anything else you remember? Anything that can help us? Help us? Or help you? Hello. Hello. You all right? I can't resist waking you. Every time I do, you look at me as if you haven't seen me in years. It makes me feel reborn. If you'd just been born... ...wouldn't you be naked? You have me there. You can have me anywhere. I can? Yeah. Here, there, anywhere you like. Does this mean that you're warming to me? Yeah. That's how I would describe it. It's just that not so long ago... ...I would have described your feelings towards me as... I'm trying to think of a better word than ""loathing."" I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman. That is something to be afraid of. - Hello. - Oh, perfect timing. Monsieur Mendel. How are things in Switzerland? My apologies, I do not mean to rush... ...but 120 million is a large sum of money. It certainly is. You didn't bring any chocolates with you? I'm afraid not. If you would type in the account number. And now the password. You can do that. I would if I knew what it was. V-E-S-P-E-R. The funds have been transferred. Sorry for disturbing you. - Auf Wiedersehen. - Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel. You know, James... ...I just want you to know that if all that was left of you... ...was your smile and your little finger... ...you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever met. That's because you know what I can do with my little finger. - I have no idea. - But you're aching to find out. You're not going to let me in there, are you? You've got your armor back on. That's that. I have no armor left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me... Whatever is left of me... ...whatever I am... ...I'm yours. I suppose M won't miss me for a couple of days. She'll be too busy sweating Mathis. Mathis? Remember I told you about Le Chiffre's tell? Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre. That's how he wiped me out. Same goes for the implant. Can't say I'm too sorry about losing that. I can't believe it. No, neither could I. I thought he had my back. But there you go, lesson learned. Does everyone have a tell? Yes. Everyone. Everyone except you. I wonder if that's why I love you. You love me? Enough to quit and float round the world with you... ...until one of us has to find an honest job. But I think that's gonna have to be you. I've no idea what an honest job is. You're serious. Like you said... ...you do what I do for too long... ...and there won't be any soul left to salvage. I'm leaving with what little I have left. Is that enough for you? - Come on. - No. No. No, stop it. Stop. I have to get to the bank. What's the time? How much do we need to float for a month? I've got plenty. No, I want to pay for my half of our aimless wanderings. You stopped wearing the necklace. Yeah. It was time. Time enough to get over someone? To realize sometimes you can forget the past. Though apparently not your employer. Back in one month. Come on. I'll get the money... ...you get supplies. I'll see you back here in half an hour. - Hello, M. - I got your note. Yes? We'll talk about that later. Right now I have a lovely man from the Treasury here... ...wondering if you're ever going to deposit the winnings. That's a shame. I didn't think they'd miss it. Yes. Well, I told them not to worry. So you'll be depositing it today. On my way to the bank right now. James Bond for Mr. Mendel. Hello. Mr. Mendel? I'm having trouble accessing the funds in my account. It was transferred to the account number... ...your company gave us, Mr. Bond. It appears the funds are being withdrawn as we speak. - Where? - The Venice branch, of course. St. Mark's Square. Is there a problem, Mr. Bond? I'll kill her! Allow me. I'm sorry, James. She had a boyfriend. A French Algerian. They were very much in love. He was kidnapped by the organization behind Le Chiffre. And they blackmailed her, threatening to kill him unless she cooperated. We should've picked up on it... ...but sometimes we're so focused on our enemies... ...we forget to watch our friends. How are you doing? She left her cell phone. She must have known I'd check it. She knew you were you. - Well, at least this clears Mathis. - No. - No? - No. We just proved that she's guilty, not that he's innocent. It could've been a double blind. Keep sweating him. You don't trust anyone, do you, James? No. Then you've learnt your lesson. Get back as soon as you can. We need you. Will do. If you do need time... Why should I need more time? The job's done, and the bitch is dead. James... ...did you ever ask yourself why you weren't killed that night? Isn't it obvious? She made a deal to spare your life in exchange for the money. I'm sure she hoped they would let her live. But she must have known she was going to her death. And now we'll never know who was behind this. The trail's gone cold. - Hello. - Mr. White? We need to talk. Who is this? The name's Bond. James Bond., (WOMAN) You know the expression ""a man's man""? A man's man is the leader of the pack. The kind of man other men look up to, admire and emulate. A man's man is the kind of man who... just doesn't get what women are about. Nick, my ex-husband, is the ultimate man's man. I probably never should have married him. I don't think he understood a thing about me. This is Nick Marshall's office. Do you want a peek? Don't worry. He never gets in before ten. He'll send you on more errands than anyone in the company. He can't do anything for himself. He's the least politically-correct guy in the universe. He's the king of all the T and A ads that we do. You want babes in bikinis, he's your man. My dad? How can I best describe him? He's always been like an uncle to me. Yeah. Uncle Dad. Although Nick was a charmer. Completely irresistible at first. Which feeds into the whole ""Man's man"" thing. You know about Nick's mother, right? Because once you understand about Nick's mother, you understand Nick. Nick was actually born and raised in Las Vegas. Nick's mother was a real honest-to-God Las Vegas showgirl. When other boys were outside riding their bikes and playing ball, Nick was backstage, hanging with the girls. He was their mascot. Their little pet. They couldn't get enough of those baby blues. If you ask me, Nick's mother just about killed it for every woman Nick would ever meet. She had a lot of sugar daddies in her life, but only one true love. The boy with the family jewels. And since Nick didn't have a father, his mom made sure he was always surrounded by strong male role models, men her little boy could really look up to. Keep counting, kid. There was nothing normal about the way Nick Marshall was raised. So what can you expect? You don't have to be Freud to figure out this was one cock-eyed way to enter the world. Don't you ever knock? It's almost ten. You gotta go to work and I gotta vacuum. And don't... Another one who wears vanilla perfume! Don't you know any women who don't smell like candy? Could you toss me my lighter, babe? Babe? What am l, a little pig? I don't have time to make you no onion bagels, so please do not beg, OK? And just for the record... I don't like finding these things. What kind of woman wears this? My mother wore underwear like that. Just put them somewhere, babe. ""Babe"" is going to put it in the trash, so your mother can excuse me. Do you ever consider dating a woman that wears real underwear? You know, that covers the entire bottom? No. If I do, shall I call you? Ah! I'm going to go clean the kitchen. You couldn't toast me a little bagel? Cream cheese, tomatoes, capers? Please? - I can't think on an empty stomach. - OK. But only because you didn't call me little pig. OK. You got it, babe. Mr Marshall, how you doing today? - Fit as a dancing bear. - I'll get that cab for you. That's some set of pipes. - You have an excellent day, sir. - And you. At ease. Oh, I'm so sorry! I absolutely did not mean to do that. Let me get that for you. - It's OK. - No, I'm mortified. I can see your hands are full. Let me get the door for you. - Thank you. - No. Thank you. Half cup, grande, non-f at, thick foam, wet cap, no lid. Half cup, grande, non-f at, thick foam, wet cap, no lid. - So when do you find out? - Today, I think. Unless I didn't get it and then I will just never find out. I didn't get it. They were looking for an earth mother. I overheard the director say I was more space cadet. I'm an actress. I can be whatever you want. Is that true? Can you? It better be true or I'm stuck playing ditsy coffee-shop girl. Thanks. Oh. Hi, Nick. Hi. Lola, my love, when are you going to let me buy you dinner? Nick, I'm not your type. Trust me on this one. Cappuccino, extra foam. Tall or grande? Grande. - At least I like to think so. - Next. Rumour has it that I'm getting some really big news at work today. Why don't we celebrate? I'll buy you a cup of coffee. Memo to you - I work in a coffee shop. Hi. What can I get you? Do you want me to stop asking you out? This'll just take a sec. If that's what you want, give me the word and I'll stop. Yes. I'm going to give you the word because I'm an actress, or at least trying to be one. I'm trying to concentrate on that, so it would be a good thing if you wouldn't mind... Stop asking me out. You seem so stressed. I am stressed. I have a lot on my plate. Let's not talk now. Why don't I meet you here tomorrow, say 10.30? OK. That would be good. - So it's a date? - It's a date. Thank you. Sir, that was inspiring. I know. Good morning. Sloane Curtis. - Good morning, Mr Marshall. - Hi. What's the dirt? - I was at breakfast... - Hey, Norm. You winning? I heard Miller's shopping around, looking for a new agency. Miller Lite. I know. I'm all over it. I heard Darcy McGuire left BBD & O. - Morning, Angela. - Left or was fired? I don't know. But everyone's thrilled. Well. So much for edgy female vision. So that girl we met last night at the club? Nothing happened after you put her in the cab? It did? Something happened? She said she had to be in bed early. I had her in bed by eleven. Or was it a quarter to? You are a genius. You know that? What can I tell you? I'm blessed. And today is my lucky day. Not only is my ex-wife Gigi remarrying, right about now, but Wanamaker wants to see me first thing. Called twice to confirm. Call me when he makes it official. It won't be so easy for you to suck up to ""Creative Director"", you know. I'll make us a lunch res to celebrate. Don't count your chickens, huh? One o'clock? - Pick you up. - Can I borrow this? (SONG: ""MACK THE KNIFE"" BY BOBBY DARIN) Hey, Dina. Do you know the difference between a wife and a job? What is it? After ten years, the job still sucks. I wouldn't do that if I were you. No. - Oh, Mr Marshall. Hi. - Hey. I put the Gillette storyboards on your desk, picked up your shoes, today's staff meeting was cancelled, and I also got your cigarettes. - The staff meeting was cancelled? - That's what I was told. Good morning, girls. Good afternoon, sire. Anybody know why the staff meeting was cancelled? Nobody called us. But Mr Wanamaker wants to see you as soon as you get in, which I told his office was 15 minutes ago. I know. You couldn't show up on time? You're being promoted. But you look very sharp. Like a creative director. Very distinguished. Can you two handle yourselves on the 44th floor? Are you kidding? We were made for the 44th floor. Now get up there so we can break out the bubbly. - Don't wait up. - Don't wait up! - He's so adorable. - The cutest thing! I'm sorry. I was in the board meeting that would never end. - Been here long? - A couple of minutes. Jess, can I get a cup of decaff and some Tylenols? And Echinacea and some club soda. I've got something on my tie. You know what? Just get me another tie. I saw the mock-ups you did for Johnny Walker. They are fantastic. That's my job, Dan. You know I'm not great at making speeches, especially when you don't write them! So I'll do my best. I've been in this racket over 30 years, and let me tell you, it doesn't get easier, it gets harder and harder. The '80s were our glory days. They were all about alcohol, tobacco and cars. I was on top of my game. And then in the '90s, men simply stopped dominating how the dollars were spent, and we lost our compass. Women between the ages of 16 and 24 are the fastest-growing consumer group in the country. We're talking about girls born in the mid-80s, who control our advertising dollars. Sorry. No Echinacea. Hi, Nick. - Hey. - Red or lavender? Red. No... Lavender. That's good. While we've been getting our rocks off shooting beer commercials with the Swedish bikini team, the industry's been transformed. We were the agency in town ten years ago. Now we're struggling to be third. If we don't evolve, and think beyond our natural ability, we're going to go down. ""Think beyond our...""? I'm not quite clear what you mean, Dan. What do you know about Darcy McGuire? I heard she just left BBD & O. I never met the woman, but I hear she's a real man-eater. She won that Cleo last year for the ad about the... Oh, yeah, right. That was her? I forgot about that. I wish I had. Oh, boy. I hear she is a bitch on wheels. That's very funny. Yeah. Why? Because I just hired her. To do what? You know I love you, Nick, but it's a woman's world out there, and getting into a woman's psyche is not exactly your strong suit. You can get into their pants better than anybody, but not their psyche. You hired Darcy McGuire to do what? She hasn't done it on her own yet, but somebody was going to grab her. And she's smart, Nick. She's very smart. You made her Creative Director, didn't you? I'm sorry, buddy, but I've got the board breathing down my neck. She's coming in today. You'll meet her. Come on, roll with this. Work with her. She's got what I need to keep this place afloat. She's got what you need meaning she's a woman? How can we compete with that? He's coming. He's coming. Not so fast, girls. Put it on ice. We'll break it out soon. We're not moving to the 44th floor? Not today. - OK, Gigi. One more. - Gigi, your ex is here. Honey, you look like 48 million dollars. Thank you. - May I kiss the bride? - Sure. - Nick. - Nick! Ted! Congratulations, Ted. You're a lucky man. Well, thanks. I happen to agree. So you're going on a cruise. Two weeks, huh? The cruise is just the last week. Alexandra has an itinerary. I f axed one to your office, one to your apartment, Ted's office has one, as does the school. In case I f all off the planet? You never know. Hey, here she is. Pretty in pink. Two whole weeks together, huh? - How are you going to handle it? - I'm going to love it. You can take care of me. Cook for me, get me my slippers. Yeah, that'll be happening. - Alexandra has a boyfriend now. - Mom! I'm telling him so he won't be surprised when he comes by. A boyfriend? You're only 13. Am I? I thought I was 15. We're gonna be fine. I'm going to meet Cameron. Is it OK if I meet Dad back at his place? - Is that all right with you? - Yeah, well... - What time? - Eight? Nine, maybe? - OK. Bye, Mom. Oh, honey, I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you too. Ted, have a good time. Bye, pumpkin. - Nick. - Honey? Later. 7.30's fine. Thanks for asking. And the name's Dad. - Here you go. - Thanks. - I heard. I can't believe this. - My next headache. Don't worry. We'll get through it. Everyone... Everyone, meet Darcy McGuire. (DARCY) Hi. Oh, my goodness. Everybody showed up. - Nice to see you. - What a pleasant surprise. - God what a small world! - Welcome aboard. I'm so glad to meet you. Hello. I'm Darcy. - Hi. I'm Nick Marshall. - I've heard a lot about you, Nick. I've heard a lot about you too, Darcy. Don't worry. Can't all be true. Let's hope not. Hey. (DAN) Standing room only. It's a first. I'm very excited for you all to meet Darcy McGuire. I know Darcy's reputation as a leader in the field precedes her. At BBD & O, Darcy led a creative team that snagged $500 million in new business wins, and that was just last year. Here at Sloane Curtis, we pride ourselves on our strategic thinking. Now it's time for us to step up and prove ourselves creatively in the marketplace. I'm thrilled that Darcy has consented to move across town, join our team, and lead us into the 21st century. Thank you, Dan. And thank you all for that warm welcome. Let me start by saying the feeling is mutual. I am absolutely thrilled to be here. When I first started, it was my dream to work at Sloane Curtis. In f act, I even applied for a job here - twice. Somebody call Personnel. But it was BBD & O that offered me a home. What I learned there was that any success I had was a direct result of the team that I worked with. I know two heads are better than one, five are better than two. And I know that if we put our heads and our hearts into this company, we'll deliver. I know that. Now, I love challenges, I love hard work. I look forward to sitting at this table, tossing ideas around until, I fear, the wee hours of the morning. But, most importantly, I want the work we do to say something about who we are, how we think, what we feel... Excuse me. So, as our friends in Hollywood say, let's cut to the chase. How are we going to turn this company around? When Sears decided to go after women in their advertising and said, ""See the softer side of Sears"", their revenues went up 30%%%. 30%%%. That's huge. Female driven advertising totalled $40 billion last year, and Sloane Curtis's share of that was...? Zero. If you want to sell an anti-wrinkle cream or a Ford Mustang to a woman, forgive me, but this is the last place you bring your business, and we can't afford to not have a piece of a $40 billion pie. So I have put together a little kit for everybody. Nobody panic. This is supposed to be fun. Every product in this box is looking for new representation right now. And they're all made for women. I'm pretty sure all the women here are familiar with these products, so for the men, let's briefly run through them. Here you go, Nick. Thank you. Each kit contains anti-wrinkle cream, mascara, moisturising lipstick, bath beads, quick-dry nail polish, an at-home waxing kit, a ""More wonderful"" Wonderbra, a home pregnancy test, hair volumiser... pore cleansing strips, Advil, control-top pantyhose and a Visa card. Now, I want everybody to come up with something. For one product, for two, the whole box. Whatever moves you. We'll get together tomorrow and see where we are. How's 8.30? Great. See you at 8.30 tomorrow morning. Nightmare. Read my lips... Night-mare. Miss, miss! Another 500 bucks. (TV) We play our dangerous game... A game of chess against our old adversary. Advers-ary? Well, surely you mean adver-sary, old boy? -..vinaigrette for salad... -..women's political caucus... ..Tuck the pelvis under. Keep lifting. Buns of steel. I'd steal her buns if I could. Here it comes. Yes! He's nailed the dismount. Now let's check in on the women's finals. Women's finals. There's too much oestrogen on TV. And we all know the perfect antidote to oestrogen. Where's Frank? Oh, I need some Frank. Help me, buddy. Help me now. # I won't dance # Don't ask me # I won't dance # Don't ask me # I won't dance, madam, with you # My heart won't let my feet do things that they should do # You know what # You're lovely # You know what, you're so lovely # And know what you'll do to me # I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore # I feel so absolutely stumped, on the floor # When you dance, you're charming # And you're gentle # Especially when you do the Continental # But this feeling isn't purely mellow # For heaven rest us # I'm not asbestos # And that's why I won't dance # Don't ask me # I won't dance, how could I... # Don't panic. This is supposed to be fun. OK. OK. I can do this. I'm a professional. Lipstick. All right. Lipstick on a guy's collar. No, women will hate that. Lipstick on a guy's collar that won't rub off. No. That's even worse. OK, OK. I've got to think like a broad. All right. I'm a broad. I see lipstick. And a dark-haired Tahitian beauty standing under a waterfall wearing nothing but a thong, water cascading down her back... I'm a lesbian. I gotta change the music. I wonder... I wonder... Ah, Alex, thank you. Jackpot. Ah. She's hot. # I hate the world today # You're so good to me, I know # But I can't change # I can understand # How you'd be so confused # I don't envy you # A little bit of everything... # You go, girl. # I'm a bitch, I'm a brother, I'm a child, I'm a mother # I volumise my hair # I am not aware... # Looks like big dandruff here. Smooth it out. Smooth. Oh, cool. Now for mascara. Nice thick lashes. Oh, shit! That stings! What the...?! OK. I need some anaesthetic here. Burp! Beautiful. OK. Now, for the pice de rsistance, we have... We have the right leg. Yes. Excellent. And the hot, hot wax. Very, very hot wax. Here we go. Oh! Ow! Ooh, that's hot. OK. Test of manhood. Here we go. Aah... OK. Passed. And next. ""Immediately apply disposable cloth over the waxed area."" Feels kind of nice. I don't know why women complain about waxing their legs. ""In one smooth motion, ""yank the strip in the opposite direction of the growth."" That'd be north. One, two, three... Aagh! Ooh! Women are insane. Who would do that more than once? I don't know. Why would anybody ever do the other leg? Yes, that's right, girls. Wax it off, then cover it up. Allez oop! Oh, shit! I guess this takes a little finesse. One down, two to go. OK. OK. Honey, you just lost yourself five pounds. All right. Where's my Wonderbra? Oh. Let's see which end is up here. Hi! - What are you doing? - Exfoliating. - Yo... - You must be... Cameron, my boyfriend. This is Nick. - Her father. - That's nice nail polish. Yeah. I'm just doing a new research thing at work. - Getting into the female psyche. - Whatever. Yeah. - I should probably take off. - No. You don't have to. - It's cool. - OK. - Bye. - Bye. I'll call you. Nice meeting you, Nick. Yeah. - Did you just kiss that guy? - Where did you get this? - It was in your zipper thing. - You went through my stuff? It was an emergency. I needed music. Are you allergic to listening? You never listen when I talk. If I'm stuck here, then my stuff's going to be laying around, OK? I don't want you to just go through everything. - I listen to you. - You think you listen to me? - Yeah. - You do? What's my boyfriend's name? It's... - Goodnight. - No, wait. Come back. Dustin is his name. That's his name, right? No. Don't slam the...! Car... Carson. Carmen. Carmine! Carmine. Carmichael! Can't remember a man's name and so you are not listening to them. What do women want? I know it has three syllables. Cameron. His name is Cameron! Oh, that is so dangerous. 90%%% of all accidents happen... (STELLA) Oh, what the hell has he done now? I hope he's not dead. No, I'm fine. Oh, boy. I think. - Are you sure? - No...yes. Cleaner pores. Thicker hair. Very weird headache. Very weird. Now I gotta clean up bras and home pregnancy tests? The man doesn't pay me enough for the things I have to do. Oh, Jesus, he's wearing pantyhose. Now he's a cross dresser? I was just experimenting with a few products from work. All right? Did I say anything? Oh, God, it's eight o'clock already. One day I'd like to sleep till eight. He'd fire my ass if I didn't wake him. Ooh! Are we in a mood today. Same as every other day. Honey, make me a little bagel with cream cheese. I can't think on an empty stomach. For your information, I am not even hungry. Who said you were? - Mr Marshall. - Good morning, Flo. - Let me get you a cab, sir. - Sure. Thank you, Flo. You're welcome, my little sweet ass. What did you say? - Me? Nothing. - Are you sure? Yes, sir. Gr-rr-rr! I think I'll walk today. I could use fresh air. You have a great day, sir. With your fine ass looking like Shaft! Ooh! I could just ride that puppy! Hey! Watch where you're going! - Are you OK, sir? - I'm fine. I'm fine. (WOMAN) Did I turn the coffee maker off? Did I turn it off? I can't remember. I saw the light on, but did I actually turn the switch off? One kiss doesn't make me a lesbian. Does it? Sorry. Two slices of toast, 150 calories, plus a pat and a half of butter... So oestrogen is good for the heart but bad for the breasts? What? My kid doesn't need Ritalin... -lf I get him to listen to me... -Monsieur, I need to poop! Oh, God! Oh, boy! Oh, God, he nearly killed me. Too bad he missed. - Good morning. - Good mor... Don't look up. He'll make me hear another disgusting joke. He's such a schmuck. She thinks that I'm a schmuck? Whoa! Lighten up on that aftershave, buddy. What? Oh, yeah, like you've got the perfect body? Jesus. - Hi, Mr Marshall. - Don't say it. What? The Gillette budget's on your desk, and I got you that Merlot you wanted. Here's your credit card back. Thank you. - Are you OK? - Yeah. Do you realise I have an Ivy League education, and that running your errands has put me into therapy? Why don't you give me some real work to do? Oh, yeah, I remember why. Because I have a vagina! Is there anything else I can get? Oh, good, you're on time. - Good morning. - Good morning. What's the matter? You look different. I think it's his hair. It looks a little thicker. Give me your coat. - You smell good today. - New cologne? That's it? No other thoughts? - What do you mean? - Are you feeling all right? Linings, loans, locks... Hello, Nick? Ah, Nick? We gotta go. What are you doing? It's 8.30. I can't go. Gotta find a doctor. I need a cure. Can't go. You sound like the guy from Shine. What's wrong with you? Maybe I need an exorcist. Under X. No, under E. There are no exorcists in the Greater Chicago area, bud. Let's pull it together and go sell some sensitive feminine shit, OK? Sorry to interrupt. Here you go. By the way, your hair looks really good today, Mr Marshall. And it's OK you pay me minimum wage because I just called my boyfriend in Israel - for an hour. Tell me you heard that? Your hair looks really good. So what? The what she was thinking thing. I don't think she thinks too much. She's not exactly a genius, pal. - She went to an Ivy League school. - I doubt that. The thing she said about the boyfriend, calling him in Israel. I didn't hear it because she didn't say it. Let's pull it together. We're going to be late for our sorority meeting. Morgan... In case I like, maybe, die today... Can we walk and talk? In case you live, I don't want to be late, OK? Here's what happened, in case the coroner asks. I got drunk last night and tried all the products from the box. - You did not? - I put on all the products. Nail polish, pantyhose, everything. - You tried on the pantyhose? - Yes! OK? I was drying my hair and I fell over and fell into the bathtub, electrocuted myself and blacked out. When I woke up, I could hear what every woman around me was thinking. - Uh-huh. - Personal, private stuff. The stuff that nobody on earth is supposed to hear. You know what I'm saying? I can hear what women think. Can you? Good. That's not a talent a lot of guys have these days. You don't believe me? You want me to prove it? - See this attorney? - Yeah. She thinks you're overpaid...and gay. What? I can hear what they're all thinking. Even French poodles! Just so we are on the same page, I need you to know you sound insane. You're freaked out over losing the job, but if you tell anyone that you hear the thoughts of a French poodle... What if I jumped out the window? Just put the fruit down and jump through the glass. Would they notice? Probably not if I didn't get glass on anybody. The girl with the fruit is kind of funny -suicidal, but she's funny. Nick, what girl with the fruit? Last one to arrive. Wants me to know I'm not his boss. OK. You're a star. I get the message. She thinks I'm late because I want her to know she's not my boss. - What is she talking about? - Put a lid on it. I can't believe I have butterflies in my stomach. Feels like the first day of school. OK. So let's see how we did. Nobody wants to go first. Everyone's avoiding me... except Nick Marshall. Unbelievable. The only one with good eye contact. At least he's looking in my eyes and not down my blouse. So, Nick, what did you come up with? Me? What did I come up with? He's so wired. Mostly I thought about the moisturising lipstick. Never having worn lipstick myself. I tried to imagine what I'd want from a lipstick if I were a woman. -Spare me! - OK. He's trying to be honest. You know, to be perfectly honest, my first thought was a Tahitian beauty bathing under a waterfall. I'm going to die here with these kinds of ideas. But, you know, I'm working on it, and it's evolving... I don't suppose anybody's interested in an idea involving the Swedish bikini team? I do know them all personally. -Oh, what an idiot. -Grow up already. -What a pig. -You are so foul. I should have asked for more money. Dina? I spent the night trying to figure out how to sell Advil just to women. You know what? We should sell it to women like me. I take it every time I need to fake a headache. Works like a charm. I got a great one. Just came to me. Mind if I interrupt, Dina? No. Sure. Go ahead. I hate that you've seen me naked. All right. We're in a bedroom, the lights are out. There's a woman in bed taking an Advil. Her husband turns over and suggestively rubs her back, and we say, ""Advil... ""so mild and gentle, you can take it even when you're faking a headache."" And then the woman says, ""Not tonight, dear, I need an Advil."" He's back. What? Come on, that doesn't reach women on a personal level? - No. - Women do that, don't they? -Not me. - I don't. Sue Cranston? You've done that, haven't you? Faked a headache? No, Nick, I haven't. Thanks for asking. No, no, no. Wait, wait. Be honest now. You've been married, what, ten, twelve years? And you've never faked a headache? It doesn't work like a charm? No, Nick, I haven't. I mean, no, it doesn't, OK? Jeez! What an asshole! OK. I guess I'm way off base here. OK. What's good about your idea is that you're looking at Advil from a woman's point of view. Um... I don't think Advil will go for it, and I'm pretty sure every woman in America will hate it, but other than that, I thought it was great. You're on the right track. Go ahead. Great antenna there, babe. Did the poodle give you that one? - Dad, why are you home so early? - I have my first migraine. This is hideous. My boyfriend feeling me up in front of my father! Alex, just don't think anything. ""The outlook wasn't good..."" Oh, shit! Where's my bra? Where is it? Oh, God. Oh, God! OK, look, everybody just needs to chill here, all right? There'll be no chilling. Just get your stuff and move on. Come on, man, relax. - How old are you? - I just turned 18. Well, she's 15. She was ten five years ago. Understand? Now get out. Dad! We're going to the prom. Don't ruin it. - You're not going to the prom. - How did you know about that? I don't know. Mom told me, all right? But he's too old for you and I know what boys his age want, and he's not getting it from my daughter. Door. Your daughter? Suddenly I'm your daughter? How am I related to this asshole? - Another one. -I want Mom. Hey, look, I'm just going to take off. - Look, I'm really sorry about... - Save it. That's mine. Where...? Where...? Great day. (SONG PLAYS: ""BITCH"" BY MEREDITH BROOKS) I'm not losing my mind. I'm not losing my mind. This will work. It's gotta work. Got to work. Ow, shit! Perfect. # I can understand how you'd be so confused # I don't envy you # I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one # I'm a bitch, I'm a lover # I'm a child, I'm a mother # I'm a sinner, I'm a saint # I do not feel ashamed # I'm your hell, I'm your dream # I'm nothing in-between # You know you wouldn't want it any other way... # Come on! Do your thing! Turn me into me again! Oh, good. I'm not dead. Oh, please. Please, please. Tell me I got rid of it. Please be a woman. For what city, please? Could you do me a favour and think of your favourite colour? For what city, please? Flo? Hey, Flo. Flo? I can't believe this. I need a woman. - Try this one. - I love this. This is fantastic. It's my mother's birthday next week, so I need two gift sets. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Do you have a Kleenex back there? I'm sure she'll like it. It's one of our best sellers. - Do I get a free gift with this? - Yes. You get a travel bag... Thank you. Stop it. You got the dress. Treat yourself to a lipstick. No. I have enough at home. We might as well get one while we're here. I have too many lipsticks. I have piles of them. I'll buy it. If he doesn't answer in the next two rings, I swear to God... Hi, blue eyes. I really feel bad about... - Dr Perkins? - Yes? You may not remember me. I'm Nick Marshall. I came here ten years ago with my ex-wife. Oh, Christ. Not him. Oh, good. You remember me. I'm sorry to barge in but I don't know who to turn to. I'm desperate. I'm afraid to go to work. I'm afraid of my doorwoman. - I'm afraid to get a cup of coffee. - Mr Marshall, please slow down. Let me completely understand what it is you're saying. All right. All right. I hear what women think. Yeah. You know, this kind of imaginary displacement scenario... I'm not imagining... I do have a friend at University Hospital who specialises in men with male menopause and testosterone depletion. She's fabulous. I'll just give her a ring and send you over there. Why did I answer my door? I was so into buying that lamp on EBay. How much was it going for? - How much was what going for? - The lamp on EBay. Oh, I see. That's good. Very clever. Dr Skolnick, please. You don't believe me. Well, then, try another one. Go on, pick a number. Any number. OK. A number between one and...? - A million. Why not? - One and a million? All right. Wanna make a decision here? Oy vay! You can say that again. - I didn't say anything! - It doesn't mean I didn't hear it. OK. OK. Let's say... Let's say I do believe you. That you er...that you can hear what women think. Even though I'm a grown woman of... My lips are sealed. Holy crap! - Oh, forgive me. - It's all right. But this is phenomenal! That you can hear inside my head. Yes. Why get rid of such a gift? Well, for starters, almost every woman I know thinks I'm an asshole. That's what I thought first. Could you please give me a break? Mr Marshall, you might find this a little unorthodox, - but would you mind if I smoked? - No. I understand. Thank you so much. Let's try to look at the upside of this. You know, Freud died at age 83 still asking one question. What do women want? Wouldn't it be strange and wonderful if you were the one man on earth finally able to answer that question? Something extraordinary and miraculous has happened to you. My advice is you must learn from this. There isn't a single woman that I treat that doesn't wish her man understood her better. If men are from Mars and women are from Venus, you speak Venusian. The world can be yours. I don't know how this happened to you or why, but you may just be the luckiest man on earth. Imagine the possibilities. If you know what women want... you can rule. Hubba-hubba, here he comes. Looking awfully good today. And I haven't had sex in four months... OK, six. Oh, why did I tell him to stop asking me out? I'm an idiot. Idiot! Hey, Nick, how's it going? Lola, my love... I can't take no for an answer. - About what? - About what? About us. Just don't hurt me, Nick. I've been hurt too many times. I know how hard it is to go out with someone new. I mean, there's always that fear of... well...getting hurt. - At least, that's how I feel. - You do? Really? All the time. - Me too all the time. - So... let's take it slow and see how it goes. Slow is good. - Slow is really good. - Yeah. You free tonight? So you don't think I'm gay? You're saying you never said that. - Right. I never said that. - But you thought it. Was it the hair? The highlights are natural. - I have a meeting. - And you never said I was overpaid? I really don't think I ever said that. OK. Who has he been talking to? - Good morning. - Good morning. Well, check your e-mail... Hi. How's the boyfriend in Israel? Thanks for picking up that wine. That is above and beyond. Thank you. Can I get you a cup of coffee? - Or some water? Any beverage? - No, but thank you. If I'm thirsty, I know where the coffee-room is. That's right, guys. Don't help. Just walk right past me. Why don't you step on my hands...? - Here you go. - Oh. How are you doing? Oh, fine. Thank you, Mr Marshall. You're welcome...er? - Erin. - Erin. You be careful, all right, Erin? Yeah. Sure. Heavy. What do you know? There is life on this planet. (DARCY) Breakfast on Tuesday sounds great. Absolutely. Thanks for the info, and thanks for the champagne. You too. OK. Bye-bye. Set meeting. Nike. Women's division. - Hi. - Hi. Well... Looks like you've been here a year. Yeah. I'm compulsive. It's a problem. Why do I always feel he's checking me out? I wonder what he's got up his sleeve. Great photographs. No clue they're Margaret Bourke White. They're not all Margaret Bourke White, are they? Yeah, they are. Wow. It's a beautiful collection. Thanks. So how's it going? I was going to ask you the same thing. It's starting slow. I'm evaluating some of the staff and that's always hard. Yeah. Right. I don't want to beat around the bush, so what I'd like to propose... He's proposing so soon? - Oh! - Oh, sorry. Ah, yes. - Excuse me. You got another one. - Thanks. Wow! As I was saying, I know nothing whatsoever about the products that you're going for personally, but I do believe I can sell anything once I know the buyer's needs. What I'd really like, with your kind indulgence, of course, is to go after that really big fish. I mean, the one your really want to land. I will reel them in for us. No, actually, I will reel them in for us. Unless you're going after something yourself. No, no. It's just there are several big fish out there. Yeah? What's your biggest fish? I mean, who's your whale? Um...Nike? Women's division? You heard they were shopping? I got wind of it. That's amazing. I heard no one knew. - You knew. - I heard no one else knew. It's OK if I know what you know. I mean, we're on the same team now. Besides, I heard someone say two heads were better than one. - Oh, you were listening? - More than you know. OK. Here is what I heard. Nike is shopping - quietly. But if they make a change, it's going to happen fast. You know this is a tough one for us to get. It would be tough for anybody, but if we got it... -that's all we'd need. - I hear you. So what do they want exactly? They want to empower women. - What? - Well... I'm sorry, I... - That won't work. - I'm sorry. I understand. Go on. They want to get inside women's heads and reach them on a very real level. Don't take this the wrong way, but you got jumpy talking about a lipstick. Nike is state-of-the-art, hardcore woman power. Are you sure you want this one? You get them here in two weeks, I'll be ready. This guy is kind of exciting. Hey! Glad I caught you both. - You got a minute? - Sure. I want you to look at these boards for US Air before they come by. - Right. - It seems like something's missing. Hmm. I don't like the graphics. Feels a bit parochial. Maybe it should be in black and white. What do you think, Nick? I don't know who you've had working on these, Dan, but... it seems kind of - what's the word? - parochial to me. What do you think, Darcy? I totally agree. Especially about the graphics. They're parochial. It's so funny you just said that. Why don't you get them to try it in black and white. Might punch it up. What? Did you say something? No. I just swear I was thinking the exact same thing. Were you? Black and white could really help. Good idea, Nick. Good idea, Nick! Quick, say something before he leaves. - Dan? - Yeah? If you want me to have another look at the boards, give me a buzz. - I will. Thanks, buddy. - Dan? In case they find Nick's idea too retro, which they might. They may hear elegant and think it's old fashioned. I'd be ready with maybe a dot com kind of thing. Maybe there's something about getting online and being online at the airport... I think we're fine. We're good. I like Nick's fix on this. Great. Do you want to come by later? I got a box of Cubans. - Great. - Cool. You smoke cigars? No. Your office is looking really snazzy. I love the red. - Thanks. - Me, too. Mr Marshall, your daughter on line one. - I'm sorry, would you mind if...? - Here you go. He has a daughter? I didn't picture that. How old? She's 15. She's staying with me while her mom's away. He's married? Away on her honeymoon. Alex, hi. Uh-huh. Sure, honey. No, that's great. Honey? Who are you trying to impress? I'm going out with my friends after school. Can I bring them back to your place? No problem. Whatever you want. What time are you going to be home? Wait for me. I gotta go. Eight's fine. I love you too. Bye, sweetie. Total shocker. He's like a nice guy. - Sorry. Duty calls. - No. Of course. - She's 15? - Yeah. She's got a boyfriend who's 18. - And you hate that, right? - Oh, hate it. But she digs him and he's invited her to the prom. That's a big deal. Going to the prom is mostly about the dress. You know that? - Is it? - Oh, yeah. Once you got the dress handled, it's all downhill. This feels like a date. Why did I go into all that? He needs to go. Well, I'm outta here. Do some research downtown. Get inside women's heads. If you need any help... - Oh, I'll be picking your brain. - You got it. I'll take it. Oh, candy. She won't last a month. You can't wear that if you have hips. - That one's cute. - I can't wear low cut. - (NICK) Alex? - It's open. What? Say something. Ah... Hi. I'm Alex's dad, Nick. - Hi. - Hi. -Deadbeat. -Mr No-food-in-the-house. -Forgot her birthday. -Why is he just standing there? Oh, I just wanted to let you know that I was home. I've got a date tonight, so I'm going out, but I'll be home early. Why don't you order a pizza? There's no food in the joint. I also wanted to know if you and I could go on a date soon. I'd like to take you shopping for a prom dress. Oh, that is so sweet. I wish my dad would do something like that. Oh, I love him. First you throw Cameron out, now you want me to go to the prom with him? Well, I overreacted and I just want to make up for it by taking you shopping. I mean, it's a pretty important thing, you know. It's all downhill after the dress. He must be stoned. Fine. I'll get the most expensive dress, shoes, make-up. He can afford it. What the hell, let's go crazy while we're at it. We'll get you new make-up, shoes, the works. What do you say? Fine. Whatever. That would mean yes, yes? Yes. Great. Well, nice to have met you two. Hope to see you again soon. - Definitely. - Bye, Mr Marshall. - Love the apartment. - Great view. Thank you. OK. I gotta tell you, I'm not usually like this on a first date. It's just that you've been so amazing. You've been so sensitive, so understanding and... - Do you want to come up? - Oh, yeah. Am I ready for him to come up? If I sleep with him, he'll think I'm a slut and never call me, or call me because he'll think he can get it whenever he wants. Oh, what's the difference? He's so incredible. He reminds me of my sister. So, what do you think? Lola, I will only come up if you really want me to. I don't want you to do anything you're not ready for. I can wait. Wow, he's got a great body... but whoa! What's with the tongue? I'm going to need the Heimlich manoeuvre. Thank you. Ooh... Ouch! That's right, they're attached. Now we're talking. Oh... OK. Lied about the grande... Aah! Would you mind if we had the lights on, maybe? You don't want the light on? - Yeah, it might help. - OK. If it'll help. God, I hope he's better with the light on. He's so all over the place. Just do it so I can start faking it. Is Britney Spears on Leno tonight? Are you OK? Yeah. I'm fine. Fine. What? What happened? All right. Let's pull this together, buddy. I mean, this is what we do. - You OK? - Yeah. Just regrouping. I can do this better. Want to bet? Yeah. Amazing! Amazing! It was like you were more inside me than anybody... ever. Well, thanks, doll. I tried. No. No. I mean more inside my head. Like you knew what I wanted and how I wanted it. We connected in a way that was beyond... beyond... Oh, my heart! My heart is beating so hard! Who would have thought it? Slow starter then turns out to be a genius in bed. Ladies and gentlemen, Nick Marshall is a sex god! Oh, yeah.

I heard that in the beauty shop this morning. But seriously, Dee, that other thing we were talking about before? I mean, he can't just ignore you all night, stay glued to the TV like some zombie and expect you to turn on like a light bulb. I wouldn't put up with that. I mean, you're either interesting or you're not. Ask him to decide. Can I write that down? I'm either interesting or I'm not. He'll shit a brick. What if he says I'm not? He won't say that you're not. Trust me. OK. I did it. I told Haim I wasn't moving to Israel. Yeah. Good. And? I said what you said. He can be a writer anywhere, but if I'm going to be in advertising, I need to be here. - And then he said? - I don't know. It was in Hebrew. But I don't think it was, ""You got it. See you next Tuesday"". I'd wait it out. He'll call you. I can't. I'd better call him back. Be strong. He will call you. Well, girls, it's been nice chatting. I gotta get back to work. - Wait! - Don't you want some coffee? Oh, no, I'm cool. Really. But thank you anyway. This was fun. Oh..! This is good. More insightful than I would have thought. This line doesn't feel exactly right. If you're thinking that line isn't perfect, I agree. It needs work. There's something not exactly right about it. I mean, it's not bad. It's insightful, actually, it's just... What do you think this woman's thinking? Ah, well... Let's see. She's thinking about what she wants out of life. What's she going to accomplish? How's she going to do all that? Women think about that a lot. Surprisingly a lot. They worry all the time, about everything. You're so right. How do you know that? Well, even I had a mother. Well, so maybe running gives her time off from all of that. It gives her something she can't get any place else. Look at her. God, I want to be her. She looks so free, doesn't she? No one's judging her. No boss to worry about. No guys to worry about. No games to figure... I like that. No games. That's good. That'd be nice in life, wouldn't it? OK. Can I just think for one second? - Take your time. - OK. OK. No games. How do I get that in? She's running. It's early. It's quiet. Just the sound of her feet on the asphalt. She likes to run alone. No pressure. No stress. This is the one place she can be herself. Look any way she wants. Think any way she wants No game playing. No rules. Games, sports, rules. Games, sports, rules. Playing by the rules, playing games versus playing... Playing by the rules, playing games versus playing... - Why are you nodding? - I think you're on to something. - Am I? - Aren't you? Well, I was thinking about a play on words. Something about games versus... I feel like I was on to something good. - Playing games versus playing... - Sports? Yes! Thank you. Do you like any of this? A lot. I like the idea that you can be yourself on the road. I do too. Did I say that out loud? No, I was just... I was circling around the exact same thing, which is great - that we're both on the same... Sorry. I'm not thinking straight. My glands may be swollen. You're doing great! ""Nike. No games..."" ""Just sports."" All right. We should write that down. All right. Did he come up with that or did I? Can I be...? What? Ah... Well, can I be honest with you? Please do. Before I came here, I heard you were a tough chauvinistic prick. I didn't know you meant that honest. - Sorry. - No, it's fine. - I'm sorry. - No, that's OK. You must have looked forward to meeting me. I was dreading it. I had this whole other person in my mind. Well, since we're sharing, I heard a few things about you too. Oh, yes. I'm the ""Man-eating bitch Darth Vader of the ad world""? - Verbatim. - Really? All right. Well, nice to meet you. But that's not who I am at all. Just for the record. I don't think that's who you are. Thank you. I appreciate that. You see, no games equals embarrassing moment. Don't fall for a guy at work. Don't fall for a guy at work. Don't fall for a guy at work. - Why? - Why what? Why...why don't I just work on these storyboards and bring them round to you tomorrow if you're free? I'm free. Just call me any time. I'm flirting! What's wrong with me? Oh, God! I just looked at his penis! Oh, I hope he didn't see me. Oh, shit! I just looked at it again! Stop it! - Are you all right? - Fine. I got something in my eye. All right. Um, so, great. So tomorrow will be... That'll be great. I'll see you then. - Good work, by the way. - You too. - You sure you're all right? - Yeah. I'm fine. (FAINT MUSIC: FRANK SINATRA SINGING) # I've got you # Under my skin # I've got you # Deep in the heart of me... # Are you laughing at me? Yeah. Good. I didn't think anyone else was still here. I didn't know anyone was here. - What time is it? - It's after ten. - I didn't realise it was so late. -I feel so alone. I...I didn't catch that. Sorry. I didn't realise how late it was. I'm glad you're here. I'm stuck. I feel so alone. Want me to give you a hand with this? No, thanks. I'm OK. Yeah? I'm not buying it. What's going on? Well, I have an early meeting tomorrow with Dan. I wanted to make it later so I could be more prepared, but you slipped in and took the only time he had left, which left me with 8.15 tomorrow morning. I'm not as ready as I wish I was. - Sorry. - You didn't do it on purpose. I just don't want him to be disappointed. Why don't we go through these together? - Really? - I insist. Unless you're too tired. - No. I'm not tired. - I can see that. It's just so far beyond tired at this point. I basically stopped sleeping ever since I took this job. - You have? - Yeah. It's weird... How do I say this? You don't feel quite like yourself here? No, I don't. Not yet, anyway. Boy. Plus I'm mad that I'm getting sick. I never ever get sick. In f act, you don't have to sit so close to me. I'll brave it. So where do we kick off? Control-top pantyhose? - OK. - Personally, I think they work. You've worn control-top pantyhose? Did you put a pair in the pink box? - Seriously? - Oh, yeah. - You are full of surprises. - Yeah. No. I mean that as a compliment. I love that. - And how did you look in them? - Ooh, hot. My daughter and her boyfriend walked in and I had them on. And they said what when they saw you in your pantyhose? I think it was the Wonderbra they noticed first, and the nail polish - fingers and toes... # Why not use your mentality? Wake up to reality # But each time I do, just the thought of you # Makes me stop just before I begin # 'Cause I've got you Under my skin. # (ALEX) The dress you picked is totally hideous. - I'm not coming out. - It can't be that bad. I look like a nun. An ugly nun. Because it's grey? Grey is the new black. If he says he likes it, I'll die. OK. Next. This, I love. Thank you. Next. (SONG: ""WHAT A GIRL WANTS"" BY CHRISTINA AGUILERA) # I want to thank you for giving me time to breathe # Like a rock you waited so patiently # While I got it together # While I figured it out, yeah, yeah # I only looked, but I never touched # 'Cause in my heart was a picture of us # Holding hands, making plans # And it's lucky for me you understand # What a girl wants, what a girl needs # Whatever makes me happy sets you free # And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly # What a girl wants, what a girl needs # Whatever keeps me in your arms # And I'm thanking you for giving it to me # What I want is what you got # And what you got is what I want # There was a time I was blind, I was so confused # I ran away just to hide it all from you # It's for keeps, yeah, It's for sure # And you're ready, you're willing to give me more # Than what a girl wants, what a girl needs # Whatever makes me happy sets you free... # - I think this is the one. - I like that... No, I love that. OK. This is it. Let me take a look. Yes. I look older. This is great. Oh, God... I need boobs. I'll buy a padded bra when he's not around. This is what I'll be wearing the last night I'm a virgin. Or should I say what I'll be taking off? Alex, I want to talk to you about something that's pretty important. I've never talked to you about this before but... Oh, God. He's going to try to be a dad. This should be hilarious. I realise I haven't been the perfect dad. Understatement of the century. - Can you pass the bread? - Yeah, sure. That doesn't mean I don't have the right to talk to you about... - About? - All right. You're a young woman now, and you may be flirting with the idea of...of... Having sex? Can I get a lemonade, please? Well, boys and girls think very differently about sex. My hunch is that girls want guys to like them and hang out with them. Whereas guys... And not all guys, right, but most guys... they pretty much just want to have sex. OK. What I'm trying to say here is, I don't want you to feel pressured because your boyfriend's older. Please. Save it. Mom had this talk with me when I was like eleven. I know you're supposed to have sex when it's special. I know everything. And Mom knows me for real, and knows my friends and knows Cameron, so let's leave the parental talks up to her. Plus I promised Cameron I'd do it prom night. And let's not make me part of this Nick makeover, or whatever this new thing is, OK? - What new thing? - What new thing?! This ridiculous new guy you're trying to be. Clowning around with me. Asking if we can make a salad together, watch Friends together. I mean, it's nuts after 15 years of no relating. I mean, come on. Who are you to talk about relationships anyway? You never had a real relationship with anyone in your entire life. Look, I'm supposed to meet my friends, - so I'm going to go, OK? - Sure. Thanks for the dress. She didn't even finish her lunch. Giving her advice? -Teenagers. -I think the talk worked. -She's totally right. -Move on, dude, it's over. Ah, please. Now you've seen how the cake is assembled, the next time you admire a wedding cake you can appreciate its architecture... That's so gorgeous. Fit, vibrant, hair... I always hated being overweight. I wanted to be thin, pretty, wear cute clothes. It built and built and my health deteriorated. I couldn't walk or stand. Couldn't even stand up at the park for 10 minutes while my kids played. I tried sitting on the swings, but the chains cut into my hips. And I couldn't run, and I couldn't move. I was tired and I wanted to be a good mom... I couldn't go on living that way. What the hell's wrong with me? Hello? (DARCY) What am I doing? Darcy? How did you know it was me? I didn't say anything. I just sensed it. Shit! Idiot! I didn't think he'd be there. - Excuse me? - I didn't mean to really call you. I had your number here and I was thinking of you. Thinking of calling you. Obviously I did call you. Oh, no, that's all right. I...er... I was thinking about you too. # I could show the world how to smile... # Here's to another great idea. You mean, let's meet for a drink? Yes. That's exactly what I wanted to say. Sometimes I think you're a bit of a mind reader. But I don't have to be a mind reader with you. - You always say what you think. - I know. It's a curse. Are you kidding? It's a relief. An enormous relief. Do you know how rare that is? To say what you think. Do you know how rare it is for someone to like that about me? Trust me, this has not been a great thing in my life. My ex-husband didn't love me, let's put it that way. He didn't love you? Did I just say that? Oh, God! I meant to say ""it"". He didn't love it. That I spoke my mind. If you want the truth, I'm not sure he ever did really love me. - Oh. - There's a conversation starter! God, a smart person would just get so very drunk now. How long were you married? A little less than a year. I've been divorced about nine months. We worked together. You know that? Yeah. I heard that. What was that like? It was great in the beginning. Then it changed, became competitive. Suddenly, the better I did, the worse we did. The price I pay for being me. I know that now. No... Truly. No, no. It's true. Do you want to know all this? Keep going. That's why I needed to get out there on my own - scary as it was. I mean, not scary, but um... Well, yeah, I was kind of scared. Why? I don't know. Guess I wasn't sure I could do the job. I mean, I thought I could do it, but I'm finding Sloane Curtis a tougher place to navigate than I thought. I'm sorry. This is insensitive of me. I know you were up for my job. I'm sorry I'm the one that got it. I'm not. I'm not. I've learned a lot from you. Like what? Well, for starters, you really love what you do. - You really love what you do. - Not as much as you. Don't say that. You're so great at it. So great at it. I think Dan's even wondering why he hired me. Really. I think the bloom is definitely off the rose. Want to hear something great? Yeah. I just closed escrow on my first apartment ever. Finally, I own my own place. What? Now I wish I was a mind reader. I was just thinking...how men like me can get so screwed up. I don't think there are men like you. If we kissed, would it ruin everything? Listen to me. I think... you're one of the great women. I really do... I'm sorry. I just meant to say thank you. I'm so sorry. (NICK) Well, I guess I'll see you... in three and a half hours! Nick, may I just say that you are an exceptionally great kisser. No. I mean really, really great. I haven't had this much fun making out since... I've never had this much fun making out. Me either. Don't let this get weird at work. We've nothing to be embarrassed about. We made out. You and I made out. And if I may, it was... Sexy as hell. God, that's just what I was about to say. Oh, I think I said it first. I think. No, you did. Well, all right. Oh, I'm a grown woman. Just say it. Do you want to come back to my place? Say it. Do you want to come...? Goodnight, Darcy. Goodnight. Goodnight. What am I doing? Lola. Here he comes. OK. Lola? I know I haven't heard from you. How long have you been out here? Just a few hours. Nick, you said that you wouldn't hurt me. And then you slept with me, and then you didn't call me for six days. In the world of ""Me"", that's torture. I mean, we have this totally unbelievable life-altering sex and then you just disappear! You stopped drinking coffee! Lola, I'm so sorry. It's OK. It's OK because I figured out your little secret. - You did? - It's so obvious. How else would you know the things you know? It wasn't obvious to anybody else. Nick, come on. You're so sensitive. You're so aware of my feelings. You're so tuned in. You talk to me like a woman, you think like a woman. Nick, admit it. You're totally and completely gay. I am? You're not? If you're not, you've got to tell me. Tell me, because based on the other night... Just put me out of my misery. Are you or aren't you? Say you're gay, then I'm not nuts, not undesirable, not rejected by another guy. -Just say it! Admit it! - OK. I'm gay. How gay? Oh... I'm as gay as it gets. You'll make some guy very happy some day. Oh, from your lips. God, I hate that I'm crying. Well, look... if things should ever change in that department... - You'll be the first to know. - You promise? Oh, yeah. I promise. Come here. Oh, boy. It was very nice to meet you, Nick. - And you. - Thanks for pip talk, yes? You two just take care of each other. - Thanks for the yarmulka. - No problem. You wear it well, yes? Happy trails, kids. Darcy! I need to talk to you. Oh, look at him. I knew it. He is weird about it. This is not about last night. It's about the Nike meeting. I honestly believe in my gut that you should make the pitch to them. God. I guilted you into this last night, didn't I? No. It would just be better if you did it. No, no. This is your baby. I've got to go meet these folks. See you in there. It's not my baby. Yes, it is. I predict no one will know I'm gone until the files start to build. It could be days. Then someone will finally ask, ""Where's the geek in the glasses who carries all the files?"" Do either of you know the story on this Erin girl? Miss Lonely Hearts? Who knows? I know. She's been here two years. She tried to be a copywriter but got turned down, so she's a messenger. - What fool turned her down? - You did, sire. Well, did I ever meet with her at least? I don't think so. As I recall, you told me to ""Blow her off"". Well, I want to meet with her now. The kid's got something kinda funny. This is your lucky day, pal. I saw the Nike group. All women. Your specialty. I'll walk you up. I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. I'm going to write her a long letter. You're doing Darcy? Since when? No. I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Men are stupider. It's true. - Would you stop it? - They are. ""They""? Are you officially a woman now? I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. And you know this whole thing about penis envy? - Yeah. - Not true. They don't envy. Half of them don't even like it! You know who has penis envy? We do. That's why we cheat and screw up. We're obsessed with our own equipment. - Are you ready? - Yup. Thanks. (NICK) You don't stand in front of a mirror before a run and wonder what the road will think of your outfit. You don't have to listen to its jokes and pretend they're funny in order to run on it. It would not be easier to run if you dressed sexier. The road doesn't notice if you're not wearing lipstick. Does not care how old you are. You do not feel uncomfortable because you make more money than the road. And you can call on the road whenever you feel like it. Whether it's been a day, or a couple of hours since your last date. The only thing the road cares about is that you visit once in a while. Nike. No games. Just sports. -He nailed it. -They hit a home run. Where do we sign? # So deep in my heart # That you're really a part of me # I've got you # Under my skin (DARCY SINGS ALONG) # I tried so # Not to give in # I said to myself # This affair never will go so well # But why should I try to resist # When, baby, I know so well # I've got you # Under my skin... # Why are you not the happiest guy in Chicago right now? You did great. No, I didn't do so great. We did so... No, actually... You did so great. You. Me. We did great. Will you come with me someplace? I want to show you something. - I have something I need to finish. - Please? Please. OK. Here you go. - Come with me. - All right. - Should I close my eyes? - No. So, you see those top two floors right there? I do. All mine. - Wow. - I know. Come here. So this is my... ..living room. It's beautiful. What are you thinking? You've got that look you have sometimes. Yeah? I was just wondering when you get to move in. Well, they said two weeks, so... OK. This is the dining room. The fireplace works. Come here. I can see elegant parties in here. Waiters with caviar, you in a beautiful gown. You can see all that? Maybe you're naked and I'm the only guest, but it would be elegant. OK. So this is upstairs. There's a second bedroom for a future office or whatever. And this is my boudoir. (FAINT MUSIC: ""NIGHT AND DAY"" BY THE TEMPTATIONS) Your boudoir comes with pretty decent music. It does. Where's that coming from? # No matter, darling, where you are # I think of you... # Let's turn up the volume. # Day and night... # So where's your bed going? Right here. # That this longing for you follows # Wherever I go # In the roaring traffic's boom... # So if you had a bed, we'd be dancing on it. I like it here. I like it here too. No. I mean I like it here. Oh. # Burning inside of me # And its torment won't be through # Till you let me spend my life # Making love to you # Day and night # Night and day. # (DAN) We're as excited as you. - Dan? - Yeah. - I've got to talk to you. - Bye. That was Nike. They're going to announce we've won the account. I gotta hand it to you. You saved my ass! You save the company's ass! I had very little to do with saving anybody's ass. It's Darcy you should be thanking. Darcy? I was there yesterday. She didn't open her mouth. I'm big enough to admit when I screw up. I looked at the marketplace and I panicked. Nick, forgive me. I want you to step in here. No, Dan. You did the right thing when you hired her. She is the best creative director I have ever seen. Bar none. This isn't...? I know she's adorable. - Yeah. - This isn't about that, is it? No. Not like that. No. Please, look... I've been doing a lot of listening lately, and I've decided I need to take a leave of absence. I need to get away - and get some perspective. - Are you nuts? What is this? What do you mean? This is the biggest account this company has ever landed. - You want nobody running the shop? - Darcy's here! For somebody who listens a lot, you don't hear so well. I had a meeting with her today. We had a talk. Oh, Dan! You didn't. Tell me you didn't fire her. She didn't even put up a fight. - Oh! - She's gone, pal. No, no. It's not too late. Call her. Tell her you need her back. Hire her back. - Calm down. I can't do that. - Why? I talked to the board and told them I don't need her any more. They offered her a settlement and she took it. Besides, Nike want you. You're what they bought! I've got to deliver! I can... Would you come out for one second? My job is to deliver you. Dan, Nike bought an idea. It wasn't even mine! Every idea that they loved yesterday came from her. If you don't get Darcy McGuire back in here pronto, the board is going to be paying your settlement. This is about saving your ass, right? Save it. Annie, get hold of Darcy's address and number as quick as possible. Yeah. Sure. Where's the girl who does the files? Erin? I don't think she's in today. Did she call in sick? I don't think so. Where does she live? - Anyone know where Erin lives? - Who's Erin? And now someone will finally ask, ""Where's the geek who carries the files?"" Hey. Did you get hold of Darcy? No? Well, keep trying. When you do get hold of her, tell her to stay put. I'm coming right over. I just have to make a stop on the way. Do you know where this is? Down the alley? Just down the alley? Thanks. Come on, Erin, be there. Please. Erin? Hello? Oh, no. ""Dear Mom..."" Mr Marshall! Mr Marshall? Yes, it's me. I'm sorry. I did not mean to scare you. OK. I just wanted to come and see how you are. How are you? If you're here because I didn't show up for work today, I'm sorry. - I was just about to call. - No, no. I'm not here because you didn't show up for work. I'm here about... I bet you're wondering why I am here, huh? As a matter of f act, I was just thinking that. I was thinking, why is Mr Marshall here in my bedroom? You were? Thinking that just now? Yeah. In my head. I must have water in my ears or something. But you're not thinking anything now, are you? I'm thinking a million things. Really? Because, you know, usually I can... You are thinking something right this minute? Mr Marshall, I am thinking that you are crazier than I am. It's gone. I'm back. I'm back. - Mr Marshall? - Yeah? I'm sorry. Is there something I can maybe do for you? No. No. Erin... Actually, I came here to see if I could do something for you. For me? Yeah. See, the truth is... The truth is... Erin, the truth is... I'm glad I got here before you did anything to hurt yourself. What makes you think that I would do something to hurt myself? I just sensed it. Really? You could sense that? That's not... That's not good. The real reason I'm here is because... Here's the thing, Erin. I'm here because, as you know, we have the Nike account, and we have a job opening in our team. And Darcy McGuire and I were discussing, you know, who could be great enough to fill that void, and your name popped into my head, and I remembered that you applied for a job as a copywriter. I thought I'd see if you were still interested. Didn't you try to meet with me a while back? Yeah. I tried, but you were unavailable and then out of town... Well, now I'm available and, as you can plainly see, I'm in town. So I'm here to take that meeting if you're available. I'm available. I'm unbelievably available. Come on, Darcy. Hi. This is Darcy McGuire. I'm not home right now, so please leave a message. I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Darcy? Hi, Darcy. It's Nick. I'm standing right outside your place here. I sure wish I could find you. Are you all right? Hope so. Anyway, call me when you get this. On my cell - 555 1226. I really need to talk to you. Er... Just making sure you're not there. You're not, right? No. I didn't think so. All right. So call me, please. Please. Bye. - Darcy? -No, it's me. Gigi. Is everything all right? Are you back in town already? Not until tomorrow. Alex called me three times from a payphone, really upset. We got disconnected. What's the matter? Isn't she at the prom? The prom. Excuse me? Do you know where Alex Marshall is? Tenth grader? Brown hair? This high? Yeah. In the ladies room. She's been there for an hour. Alex? Are you in here? Alex, it's me. What are you doing here? Oh, honey, I just... I can't believe that I screwed up. I wasn't there when you left. Yeah? Well, it's not why I'm in here, so you can just go, OK? Oh, boy. I feel awful. Are you OK? Come on out and let me see how you look at least. Come on. I look like crap. I already took my hair out and everything. So what happened? Well, if I told you, you'd just freak out, so... What have you got to lose? Try me. OK. Cameron and his friends, they had this big plan and they rented this hotel room and... It was like a suite. Basically, I promised him that I was going to... I can't believe I'm going to say this to you. I promised him that I was going to... sleep with him after the prom. And an hour ago, we were on the dance floor, and I said, ""I'm sorry, Cameron, you know, I'm just not ready"". Good. Good girl. - Dad, come on. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go on. And he goes, ""Well, the limo, the room and the tux cost me $400,"" and I said, ""I'm sorry, I'm just not..."" And he cuts me off and he says, ""I never should have asked a stupid sophomore to the prom. ""What a waste"". Well, two seconds later... he goes and meets up with his old girlfriend and starts making out with her. This disgusting slut with a tongue ring. And then they were laughing and... I just can't go out there ever. Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you. - Dad! What are you doing? - Sorry. I'm sorry, but I am. Believe it or not, I know what it's like to be a woman. It's not as easy as it looks. But you stood up for yourself. You know how ahead of the game you are? A guy who treats you like that and talks to you like that, he's not... Worth my time. Yes, I know. It's true. He's not. And he's a total game player and I hate that. You are so much smarter than me. And look at you. That clown made out with a girl with a tongue ring over you? Honey... you look beautiful. Thanks. Take me home, Dad. What am I doing? She's not in the refrigerator. I wonder if it's too late to go over there. Of course it's not. It's never too late to do the right thing. I'll go over there and do the right thing. Hello? Ah, hi. It's me. I'm glad I found you. Ah, can I come up? Darcy? I need to... Hey. You need to what? It's one in the morning. I need to talk to you. OK. Thanks. So, you sleep here now? Well, I thought I'd give it a try before I have to sell the place. Sell it? You're not selling it? I can't afford to keep it. I don't have a job. You ought to try returning some of your phone calls. You got your job back. Do I? You're a real riot, you know that? It's true. Dan told me so himself. Why would he? I didn't do the job that he hired me to do. I don't blame him for firing me. Look, I'm er... Come on in. I don't have any chairs, but if you want to... What if I told you that you did everything you were hired to do, everything, but that someone was sabotaging you. Picking your brain, swiping your ideas... and you never even knew what hit you. How is that possible? Oh, trust me. It's possible. Who would do such an awful thing? I would. I was a dope with a corner office, and when you came with the job I was supposed to have... I mean, it didn't matter to me that... you were better at it than me or you earned it, I felt it was mine, and I was going to do anything to get it back. And so I took advantage of you in the worst possible way. Have you ever done that? Taken the wrong road? No, of course you haven't. You wouldn't do that. Somebody like me does that. And er...the problem was that while I was digging a hole under you... I found out all about you. And the more I found out... the more you dazzled me. I mean, shook my world, changed my life, dazzled me. And guys like that ex-husband of yours, I mean, he made you feel that the price you pay just for being you is that you don't get to have love. Isn't that what you were trying to say the other night? That you weren't complete? That you weren't really a winner like that? Everything about you - how smart you are, how good you are... Everything just makes me want you even more. Oh, boy. It looks like I'm here at one in the morning being all heroic, trying to rescue you. But the truth is... I'm the one that needs to be rescued. I sure wish I could read your mind. Well, I was thinking that um... if everything you're saying is true, if I really have my job back... then I think you're fired. I never really thought about it from that angle. Well, not that I don't deserve it. I..d-d-d... I'm stuttering. Now I feel kind of embarrassed that I told you I needed to be rescued. That's fine. (DARCY) That's it? I don't want that to be it. I don't want that to be it at all. Then don't let a little thing like me firing you stand in your way. I didn't know what to react to first. Hey, newsflash. I took the wrong road. What kind of knight in shining armour would I be if the man I love needs rescuing and I just let him walk out my door? My hero. # Night and day # You are the one # Only you beneath the moon # And under the sun # Whether near to me or far # It's no matter, darling, where you are # I think of you # Night and day # And this torment won't be through # Till you let me spend my life # Making love to you # Day and night # Night and day. # (SONG: ""SITTING ON A RAINBOW"" BY PEGGY LEE) # I've got the world on a string # Sitting on a rainbow # Got that string around my finger # What a world # What a life # I'm in love # I've got a song that I sing # I can make the rain go # Any time I move my finger # Lucky me, can't you see? # I'm in love # And life is a beautiful thing # As long as I hold the string # I'd be a silly so-and-so # If I should ever let go # I've got the world on a string # Sitting on a rainbow # Got that string around my finger # What a world # What a life # I'm in love. # (SONG: ""TOO MARVELLOUS FOR WORDS"" BY FRANK SINATRA) # You're just too marvellous # Too marvellous for words # Like glorious # Glamorous # And that old stand-by, amorous # It's all too wonderful # I'll never find the words # That say enough # Tell enough # I mean they just aren't swell enough # You're much too much # And just too very very # To ever be # In Webster's Dictionary # And so I'm borrowing # A love song from the birds # To tell you that you're marvellous # Tell you that you're marvellous # Tell you that you're marvellous # Too marvellous # For words. #, Bloody kids. How fastidious you've become, Wormtail. As I recall, you once called the nearest gutter pipe home. Could it be that the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you? Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... ...perhaps if we were to do it without the boy. No! The boy is everything! It cannot be done without him. And it will be done. Exactly as I said. - I will not disappoint you, my Lord. - Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign. Nagini tells me the old Muggle caretaker... ...is standing just outside the door. Step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting. Avada Kedavra! Harry. Harry! Are you all right? Hermione. Bad dream. - When did you get here? - Just now. You? Last night. Wake up! Wake up, Ronald! Bloody hell. Honestly, get dressed. And don't go back to sleep. Come on, Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready! - Ron, where are we actually going? - Don't know. - Hey, Dad. Where are we going? - Haven't the foggiest. Keep up! Arthur! It's about time, son. Sorry, Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory, everyone. Works with me at the Ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right? Yes, sir. This way. Merlin's beard! You must be Harry Potter. - Yes, sir. - Great, great pleasure. Pleasure to meet you too, sir. Yes, it's just over there. - Shall we? - Oh, yeah. We don't want to be late. Come on. Nearly there now. Get yourself into a good position. Why are they all standing around that manky old boot? - That isn't just any manky old boot. - It's a Portkey. Time to go! What's a Portkey? - Ready! After three. One, two... - Harry! ...three! Let go, kids! - What?! - Let go! I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh? - Total shambles, as per usual. - Thanks. Go on, look at that! Well, kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup! Stay together! Keep up, girls! Look! Come on! Keep up, girls! Blimey! Parting of the ways, I think, old chap. - See you at the match. - See you. - Cedric. - Ced, come on. See you later, Cedric. Home sweet home. What? - Excellent, excellent. - Ginny, look! - All to the bath. - Look. Girls, choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen. We're all hungry. - Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron! - Feet off the table! - Feet off the table! - Feet off the table! I love magic. Get your Quidditch World Cup programs here! Blimey, Dad. How far up are we? Well, put it this way: If it rains... ...you'll be the first to know. Father and I are in the minister's box... ...by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself. Don't boast, Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself, won't you? While you can. Come on up. Take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for. Come on! It's the Irish! There's Troy! - And Mullet! - And Moran! Ireland! Ireland! Ireland! - Here come the Bulgarians! - Yes! Who's that? That, sis, is the best Seeker in the world. Krum! Krum! Krum! Krum! Yes! Good evening! As Minister for Magic... ...it gives me great pleasure... ...to welcome each and every one of you... ...to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup! Let the match... ...begin! Krum! Krum! Krum! There's no one like Krum. - Krum? - Dumb Krum? He's like a bird, the way he rides the wind. - He's more than an athlete. - Dumb Krum. He's an artist. - I think you're in love, Ron. - Shut up. Viktor, I love you Viktor, I do When we're apart My heart beats only for you Sounds like the Irish have got their pride on. Stop! Stop it! It's not the Irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now! Get out, it's the Death Eaters! Get back to the Portkey, everybody, and stick together! Fred, George! Ginny is your responsibility. Go! Harry! - Keep up, you lot! - Harry! Harry! Harry! Morsmordre! Harry! - Where are you? - Harry! We've been looking for you for ages! Thought we lost you, mate. What is that? Stupefy! Stop! That's my son! - Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right? - We came back for Harry. Which of you conjured it? - Crouch, you can't possi... - Do not lie! You've been discovered at the scene of the crime. - Crime? - Barty! They're just kids. What crime? It's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark. What, Voldemort? Those people tonight, in the masks, they're his too, aren't they? - His followers? - Yeah. Death Eaters. - Follow me. - There was a man, before. There! All of you, this way! A man, Harry? Who? I don't know. I didn't see his face. Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley, dears? Packet of Drooble's... ...and a Licorice Wand. On second thought, just the Drooble's. - It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry. - Just the Drooble's. Thanks. Two Pumpkin Pasties, please. Thank you. Anything sweet for you, dear? Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you. Anything from the trolley? This is horrible. How can the Ministry not know who conjured it? Wasn't there any security or...? Loads, according to Dad. That's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses. It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar. I'm fine. You know Sirius will want to hear about this... ...what you saw at the World Cup and the dream. Hedwig. There we go. Clear the runway! Well, there's something you don't see every day. Well, now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year... ...but home to some very special guests as well. You see, Hogwarts has been chosen... Yes, what is it? What is it? Tell them to wait. Tell them to wait. Wait. So Hogwarts has been chosen to host a legendary event: The Triwizard Tournament. - For those of you who do not know... - Brilliant. ...the Triwizard Tournament brings together three schools... ...for a series of magical contests. From each school, a single student is selected to compete. Now let me be clear. If chosen, you stand alone. And trust me when I say... ...these contests are not for the faint-hearted. But more of that later. For now, please join me in welcoming... ...the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic... ...and their headmistress, Madame Maxime. Bloody hell. Blimey. That's one big woman. And now our friends from the north. Please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang... ...and their high master, lgor Karkaroff. Oh, it's Krum! Blimey, it's him! Viktor Krum! Albus. Igor. Professor Dumbly-dorr, my horses have traveled a long way. - They will need attending to. - Don't worry, Madame Maxime. Our gamekeeper, Hagrid, is more than capable of seeing to them. But you know, Monsieur Hagrid... ...they drink only single-malt whiskey. You idiot! Your attention, please! I'd like to say a few words. Eternal glory. That is what awaits the student who wins the Triwizard Tournament. But to do this, that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks. - Wicked. - Wicked. For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this... ...we have the head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation... ...Mr. Bartemius Crouch. Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody. - Alastor Moody? The Auror? - Auror? Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are filled thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter, though, these days. - My dear old friend, thanks for coming. - Stupid ceiling. Thank you. What's that he's drinking, do you suppose? I don't know, but I don't think it's pumpkin juice. After due consideration... ...the Ministry has concluded that, for their own safety... ...no student under the age of 17... ...shall be allowed to put forth their name for the Triwizard Tournament. - This decision is final. - That's rubbish! That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing! - Silence! - They're not too happy about that, then. The Goblet of Fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves to the tournament... ...need only write their name upon a piece of parchment... ...and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly. If chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, the Triwizard Tournament has begun. Alastor Moody. Ex-Auror... ...Ministry malcontent... ...and your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. I am here because Dumbledore asked me. End of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? When it comes to the Dark Arts... ...I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many Unforgivable Curses there are? - Three, sir. - And they are so named? Because they are unforgivable. The use of any one of them will... Will earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban, correct. The Ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against! You need to be prepared. You need to find another place to put your chewing gum... ...besides the underside of your desk, Mr. Finnigan! No way. The old codger can see out the back of his head. And hear across classrooms! So which curse shall we see first? - Weasley! - Yes? Stand. Give us a curse. Well, my dad did tell me about one. The lmperius Curse. Oh, yeah, your father would know all about that. Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why. Hello. Lovely little beauty. Engorgio. Imperio! Don't worry. It's completely harmless. If she bites... ...she's lethal. What are you laughing at? Get off! Talented, isn't she? What should I have her do next? Jump out the window? Drown herself? Scores of witches and wizards have claimed... ...that they only did You-Know-Who's bidding... ...under the influence of the lmperius Curse. But here's the rub: How do we sort out the liars? Another, another. Up, up. Come on. Longbottom, is it? Up. Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology. There's the... The Cruciatus Curse. Correct, correct. Come, come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse. Crucio! Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him? Stop it! Perhaps you could give us the last Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger. No? Avada Kedavra! The Killing Curse. Only one person is known to have survived it... ...and he's sitting in this room. Brilliant, isn't he? Completely demented, of course, and terrifying to be in the same room with... ...but he's really been there, you know? He's looked evil in the eye. There's a reason those curses are unforgivable. To perform them in a classroom... I mean, did you see Neville's face? Neville? Son? You all right? Come on. We'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something. We're gonna be late! Come on, Cedric. Put it in! Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it? Three years from now, when we're old enough to be chosen. Yeah, rather you than me. Yes! Thank you, thank you. - Well, lads, we've done it. - Cooked it up just this morning. It's not going to work. - Oh, yeah? - And why is that, Granger? You see this? This is an Age Line. Dumbledore drew it himself. So? So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled... ...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted as an Aging Potion. - But that's why it's so brilliant. - Because it's so pathetically dimwitted. - Ready, Fred? - Ready, George. - Bottoms up. - Bottoms up. - Yes! - Yes! Yeah! Yes! Ready? - Yes! - Yes! - You said! - You said! - Oh, right, you want a piece of me?! - I'll tear your ears off! - Now you're making me laugh. - Take this! Come on! Fight! Fight! Fight! We're ""old school,"" right? Yeah, but you look older! Sit down. Please. Now the moment you've all been waiting for: The champion selection. The Durmstrang champion is Viktor Krum. The champion for Beauxbatons... ...is Fleur Delacour. The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory! Excellent! We now have our three champions. But in the end, only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions... ...this vessel of victory... ...the Triwizard Cup! Harry Potter. Harry Potter? No. No. Harry Potter! Go on, Harry. Harry, for goodness sake. He's a cheat! He's not even 17 yet! - It's wrong, I tell you! - You French tart. - Everything is a conspiracy theory! - Quiet! I can't think! - Everything is a conspiracy theory! - I protest. - Harry. - I protest! Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire? - No, sir. - Did you ask one of the older students... ...to do it for you? - No, sir. - You're absolutely sure? - Yes. Yes, sir. - But of course he is lying. - The hell he is! The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object. Only an exceptionally powerful Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year. You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye. It was once my job to think as dark wizards do, Karkaroff... ...perhaps you remember. - This doesn't help, Alastor. Leave this to you, Barty. The rules are absolute. The Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr. Potter has no choice. He is, as of tonight... ...a Triwizard champion. This can't go on, Albus. First the Dark Mark. Now this? What do you suggest, Minerva? Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete. You heard Barty. The rules are clear. Well, the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accommodate the Ministry? Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence. However, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events... ...perhaps we should, for the time being... ...let them unfold. What...? Do nothing? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat. I agree. With Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you? - I can do that. - Don't let him know, though. He must be anxious enough as it is... ...knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are. How did you do it? Never mind. Doesn't matter. Might've let your best friend know, though. - Let you know what? - You know bloody well what. I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron. Okay? - You're being stupid. - Yeah, that's me. Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's stupid friend. I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't want eternal glory. I just wanna be... Look, I don't know what happened tonight... ...and I don't know why. It just did. Okay? Piss off. What a charismatic quartet. Hello. I'm Rita Skeeter. I write for the Daily Prophet. But of course you know that, don't you? It's you we don't know. You're the juicy news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? What mysteries do the muscles mask? Does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick? ""Me, Myself & l"" want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So who's feeling up to sharing? Shall we start with the youngest? Lovely. This is cozy. It's a broom cupboard. You should feel right at home, then. Don't mind if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you? No. So tell me, Harry. Here you sit, a mere boy of 12... I'm 14. Sorry. - About to compete against three students... ...not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself... ...but who have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt... ...in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned? I don't know. I haven't really thought about it. Just ignore the quill. Then, of course, you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you? - Fourteen. - Your story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past... ...that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament? No, I didn't enter. Of course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel, Harry. Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive... ...how do you think they'd feel? Proud? Or concerned... ...that your attitude shows, at best, a pathological need for attention... ...at worst, a psychotic death wish? Hey, my eyes aren't ""glistening with the ghosts of my past."" Harry, I couldn 't risk sending Hedwig. Since the World Cup, the Ministry's been intercepting more and more owls... ...and she's too easily recognized. We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face. Meet me in the Gryffindor common room, 1:00 this Saturday night. And make sure you're alone. Sirius. P. S: The bird bites. Sirius? Harry Potter, age 12... ...suspect entrant in the Triwizard Tournament. His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his past... ...and choking back tears... Sirius. How...? I don't have much time, so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the Goblet of Fire? No! I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort. But who was the third man in the room? - I don't know. - You didn't hear a name? No. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important. And what was that? He wanted... ...me. I don't know why. But he was gonna use this man to get to me. But, I mean, it was only a dream, right? Yes. It's just a dream. Look, Harry. The Death Eaters at the World Cup, your name rising from that goblet... ...these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe anymore. What are you saying? I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff? He was a Death Eater. And no one, no one stops being a Death Eater. Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone. Sent his own son to Azkaban. You think one of them put my name in the goblet? I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet... ...but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this tournament. - I'm not ready for this, Sirius. - You don't have a choice. - Someone's coming. - Keep your friends close, Harry. - Who were you talking to? - What? - Who says I was talking to anyone? - I heard voices. Maybe you're imagining things. Wouldn't be the first time. You're probably just practicing for your next interview, I expect. Amazing. - Amazing! - Neville. You're doing it again. Right, sorry. ""Magical Water Plants of the Highland Lochs""? Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea. It's already been through enough people. Why don't you just go and talk to him yourself? Ron, this is your problem, not mine. What do you want me to say again? Go. Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him... ...that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid's looking for you. Is that right? Well, you... What? - Are you sure you won't do this? - Do it. Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me to say it again. Hagrid's looking for you. - Well, you can tell Ronald... - I'm not an owl! Did you bring your father's cloak, like I asked you? Yeah, I brought the cloak. Hagrid, where are we going? You'll see soon enough. Now pay attention, this is important. What's with the flower? Hagrid, have you combed your hair? As a matter of fact, I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again. Hagrid? The cloak! Put the cloak on! - Bonsoir, Olympe. - Oh, Hagrid. I thought perhaps you weren't coming. I thought perhaps... ...you had forgotten me. Couldn't forget you, Olympe. What is it you wanted to show me? When we spoke earlier, you sounded so... ...exhilarated. You'll be glad you came. Trust me. Can we get closer? Dragons? That's the first task? - You're joking. - Come on, Harry. These are seriously misunderstood creatures. Oh, crikey! Although, I have to admit... ...that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him, you know. - Ron was here? - Oh, sure. His brother Charlie helped to bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that? No, he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing. - You cheat, Potter. - You stink, Potter. - Good luck, Potter. - Potter stinks! - Cedric rules. - Thanks. Like the badge? Excuse me. Harry. Hey! Read the badge, Potter! Can I have a word? - All right. - You stink, Potter! - Potter, you stink! - Harry Potter smells! Dragons. That's the first task. - They've got one for each of us. - Come on, Ced! Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...? - Yes. - Come on, Ced, leave him. - Right. - He's not worth it. - Read the badges, Potter! - Hey, listen. About the badges. - I've asked them not to wear them, but... - Don't worry about it. It's not like I try to blow things up, exactly. It just happens a fair bit. You have to admit, though, fire's pretty fascinating. You're a right foul git, you know that? - You think so? - I know so. Anything else? - Yeah. Stay away from me. - Fine. - There's Potter. Cheat. - Why so tense, Potter? My father and I have a bet, you see. I don't think you're gonna last 10 minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five. I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy. He's vile and cruel. And you're just pathetic. - Pathetic? - Oh, no, you don't, sonny! I'll teach you to curse someone when their back is turned! You stinking, cowardly, scummy... - Professor Moody! ...back-shooting... - What are you doing? - Teaching. - Is that a...? Is that a student? - Technically, it's a ferret. Stand still! Stand still! - My father will hear about this! - Is that a threat? - Professor Moody! - Is that a threat? Professor! I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair! - Alastor! Alastor. - It doesn't end here! We never use transfiguration as a punishment! Surely Dumbledore told you that. - He might've mentioned it. - Well, you will do well to remember it. Away! You. Come with me. That's a Foe-Glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see the whites of their eyes, they're standing right behind me. Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in there. You wouldn't believe it if I did. Now... ...what are you going to do about your dragon? Well, you know, I just thought I'd... Sit. Listen to me, Potter. Your pal Diggory? By your age, he could turn a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour? She's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust... ...but Karkaroff's is not. They'll have a strategy. And you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths. Come on, Potter. What are your strengths? I don't know. Well, I can fly. I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I... - Better than fair, the way I heard it. - But I'm not allowed a broom. You're allowed a wand. Bets! Place your bets! Bets taken! Bets taken here! Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter in today's bloodbath? Smart money's on Krum to survive! Any bets? Yes, sir? Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go. Thank you very much. Your attention, please. This is a great day for all of us. Each of the three tasks involves very considerable danger. Please keep your seats at all times. This will minimize any risks you may be exposed to. - Harry? Is that you? - Yeah. I'm sure we all wish our champions... - How are you feeling? Okay? ...the greatest of luck. The key is to concentrate. After that, you just have to... Battle a dragon. Young love. How... ...stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today... ...you two may even make the front page. You have no business here. This tent is for champions... ...and friends. No matter. We've got what we wanted. Good day, champions. Gather round, please. Now, you've waited, you've wondered, and at last the moment has arrived. A moment only four of you can fully appreciate. What are you doing here, Miss Granger? Sorry, I'll just go. Barty, the bag. Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum. And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here. That's right. Now... ...Miss Delacour, if you will. The Welsh Green. Mr. Krum. The Chinese Fireball. The Swedish Short-Snout. - Which leaves... - The Horntail. - What's that, boy? - Nothing. The Hungarian Horntail. These represent four very real dragons... ...each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple: Collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue... ...without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions? Very well. Good luck, champions. Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon, you may... Diggory! Diggory! Diggory! Three of our champions have now faced their dragons... ...and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant. Harry! Harry! Harry! Your wand, Harry! Your wand! Accio Firebolt! - Yeah! - Yes! Oh, my God. - Yeah! - Yeah! Well done, dragon! Yes! Yes! - Yes, Harry! - Knew you wouldn't die. Lose a leg. - Or an arm. - Pack it in altogether? - Never! - Never! Shush! Go on, Harry. What's the clue? - Who wants me to open it? - Yes! - Do you want me to open it? - Yes! What the bloody hell was that? All right, everyone! Go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosy sods listening in. I reckon you have to be barking mad to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire. Caught on, have you? Took you long enough. I wasn't the only one who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back. Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better. - Least I warned you about the dragons. - Hagrid warned me about the dragons. No, no, no, I did. No, don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you... ...that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought we'd be all right, you know... ...after you'd figured that out. Who...? Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental. Yeah. Isn't it? I suppose I was a bit distraught. Boys. - Hi, Harry. - Hi, Harry. Cho, Harry's looking at you. Shush. Look at this! I can't believe it! She's done it again. ""Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl... ...seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey, sources report... ...is none other than the Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow."" Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley. Thank you, Nigel. Not now, Nigel. Later. Go on. I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh, look, Mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress. Well, it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet? Nose down, Harry. - Ginny, these must be for you. - I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly. What are you on about? They're not for Ginny. They're for you. - Dress robes. - Dress robes? For what? The Yule Ball... ...has been a tradition of the Triwizard Tournament... ...since its inception. On Christmas Eve night, we and our guests... ...gather in the Great Hall... ...for a night of well-mannered frivolity. As representatives of the host school... ...I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward. And I mean this literally, because... ...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost... ...a dance. Silence! The house of Godric Gryffindor has commanded the respect... ...of the wizard world for nearly 10 centuries. I will not have you, in the course of a single evening, besmirching that name... ...by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons. Try saying that five times fast, huh? Now, to dance... ...is to let the body breathe. Inside every girl, a secret swan slumbers... ...longing to burst forth and take flight. Something's about to burst out of Eloise Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan. Inside every boy, a lordly lion prepared to prance. - Mr. Weasley. - Yes? Will you join me, please? Now, place your right hand on my waist. - Where? - My waist. And extend your arm. Mr. Filch, if you please. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Never gonna let him forget this, are you? - Never. - Never. Everybody come together. Boys, on your feet! Why do they have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one on their own to ask them? Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons. If you can't get a date, who can? I think I'd take the dragon right now. I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well. She left when I was about 3. No, not the maternal sort, her. Broke me dad's heart, though. He was a tiny little fella, my dad. I could pick him up at the age of 6 with one hand and put him up on the dresser. He laughed so hard at that. Very funny. And then he died just when I started school, so... So I sort of had to make me own way, as it were. But enough of me. What about you? This is mad. At this rate, we'll be the only ones in our year without dates. Well, us and Neville. Yeah, but, then again, he can take himself. It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone. Now I'm really depressed. ""Get a move on or all the good ones will have gone."" Who you going with, then? - Oi, Angelina? - What? Do you wanna go to the ball with me? To the ball? Yeah, all right. Oi, Hermione. You're a girl. Very well spotted. Come with one of us? Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl, it's just sad. I won't be going alone, because, believe it or not, someone's asked me! And I said yes! Bloody hell. She's lying, right? If you say so. Look, we've just gotta grit our teeth and do it. Tonight, when we get back to the common room... ...we'll both have partners. Agreed? Agreed. - Cho! - Harry! Watch yourself on the stairs. It's a bit icy at the top. Okay, thanks. Cho? Yes? Well, I just wondered if you... I wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me. Sorry, I didn't catch that. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me. Harry... ...I'm sorry, but someone's already asked me. And... Well, I've said I'll go with him. Okay. Yeah. Great. Fine. No problem. Okay. Good. Harry? I really am... ...sorry. It's all right, Ron. It's okay, Ron. It's all right. It doesn't matter. What happened to you? He just asked Fleur Delacour out. - What? - What did she say? No, of course. - She said yes? - Don't be silly. There she was, walking by. You know how I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it. It just sort of slipped out. Actually, he sort of screamed at her. It was a bit frightening. - And what did you do then? - What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this, Harry. I don't know what got into me. - Hi, Harry. - Hi, Harry. I always liked looking at them from behind. She's never gonna forgive me, ever. Hey! Bloody hell. Bloody hell. Bloody... Oh, bloody... What are those? What are those? - My dress robes. - Well, they're all right! No lace. No dodgy little collar. Well, I expect yours are more traditional. Traditional?! They're ancient! I look like my Great Aunt Tessie! I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie. Murder me, Harry. Leave it alone! Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room, crying her eyes out. - Who? - Hermione, of course. Come on, Harry, why do you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with? Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did. Nobody asked her. Would've taken her myself if she wasn't so bloody proud. - Hello, boys. - Hello, boys. Don't you look... ...dashing. There you are, Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready? - Ready, professor? - To dance. It's traditional that the three champions... Well, in this case, four. - Are the first to dance. - Surely I told you that. - No. Well, now you know. As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed into the Great Hall with Miss Patil. - Oh, there you are. - Come on, then. Come along this way. Oh, come on. - Hi. - Now, I need you all to line up... ...in the procession, please. Oh, you are very late. This way. This way. Come along. She looks beautiful! Yeah, she does. Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum? No. Absolutely not. Hi! Harry, take my waist. - What? - Now! Are you ready? Move your body like a hairy troll Learning to rock and roll Spin around like a crazy elf Dancing by himself Boogie down like a unicorn No stopping till the break of dawn Put your hands up in the air Like an ogre who just don 't care Can you dance like a Hippogriff? Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he? I don't think it was the books that had him going to the library. May I have your arm? Arm. Leg. I'm yours. Hot, isn't it? Viktor's gone to go and get drinks. Would you care to join us? No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor. What's got your wand in a knot? He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternizing with the enemy. The enemy? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament... ...is international magical cooperation... ...to make friends. I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind. Are you going to ask me to dance or not? No. - He's using you. - How dare you?! - Besides, I can take care of myself. - I doubt it. He's way too old. - What?! What? That's what you think? - Yeah, that's what I think. You know the solution then, don't you? - Go on. - Next time there's a ball... ...pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does! And not as a last resort. Well, that's... I mean, that's just completely off the point. Harry. Where have you been? Never mind! Off to bed, both of you. - They get scary when they get older. - Ron, you spoiled everything! What's this about? No, don 't let This magic die The answer's there Let me see it again. Yes, the time is close now. Harry, at last! Step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting. You all right, Harry? I just got in. Me. Harry, you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. - The task is two days from now. - Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out. Wouldn't know. We don't actually talk about the tournament. Actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly loquacious. Mostly, he watches me study. It's a bit annoying, actually. You are trying to figure this egg out, aren't you? What's that supposed to mean? It just means these tasks are designed to test you... ...in the most brutal way. They're almost cruel. And... ...I'm scared for you. You got by the dragons mostly on nerve. I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time. Hey, Potter! - Potter! - Cedric. How...? How are you? Spectacular. I realize I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons. Forget it. I'm sure you would've done the same for me. Exactly. You know the Prefects' bathroom on the fifth floor? It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg... ...and mull things over in the hot water. I must be out of my mind. I'm definitely out of my mind. I'd try putting it in the water if I were you. Myrtle! Hello, Harry. Long time no see. I was circling a blocked drain the other day... ...and could swear I saw a bit of Polyjuice Potion. Not being a bad boy again, are you, Harry? Polyjuice Potion? Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say, ""Try putting it in the water""? That's what he did. The other boy... ...the handsome one... ...Cedric. Well, go on. Open it. Come seek us Where our voices sound We cannot sing Above the ground An hour long you'll have to look To recover what we took Myrtle... ...there aren't merpeople in the Black Lake, are there? Very good. It took Cedric ages to riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles were gone. Harry, tell me again. ""Come seek us where our voices sound."" The Black Lake, that's obvious. ""An hour long you'll have to look."" Again, obvious. Though, admittedly, potentially problematic. ""Potentially problematic""? When's the last time you held your breath underwater for an hour, Hermione? Look, Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out. Hate to break up the skull session. Professor McGonagall wants you in her office. Not you, Potter, just Weasley and Granger. But, sir, the second task is only hours away, and... Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now... ...and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom! Why don't you help Potter put his books back. You know, if you're interested in plants... ...you'd be better off with Goshawk's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal who's growing gravity-resistant trees? Neville, no offense, but I really don't care... ...about plants. Now, if there's... ...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour... ...then great. But otherwise... I don't know about a turnip. But you could always use gillyweed. - Any bets? Any bets? - Come on, place your bets! Step up, mates! Don't be shy. - Three lads. - One lady. - Four go down. - But do four come up? Don't be so mean. - Any bets? - Fleur's 10-1. - You're sure about this, Neville? - Absolutely. - For an hour? - Most likely. Most likely? Well, there is some debate among herbologists... ...as to the effects of fresh water versus salt water... You're telling me this now? You must be joking! I just wanted to help. Well, that makes you a right sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway? - You seem a little tense, Harry. - Do I? Welcome to the second task. Last night, something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion... ...now lie on the bottom of the Black Lake. In order to win... ...each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. - Simple enough, except for this: - Put that in your mouth. They will have but one hour to do so, and one hour only. After that, they'll be on their own. No magic will save them. You may begin at the sound of the cannon. - What's the matter with him? - I don't know, I can't see him. Oh, my God. I've killed Harry Potter. Yeah! What? The Beauxbatons champion, Miss Delacour... ...has unfortunately been forced to retire... ...so she will take no further part in this task. But she's my friend too! Only one! Let's get down below. Krum! Krum! Krum! Yes! Ascendio! Harry! He's all right. He's all right. Barty! - Go get him another towel. - I want all the judges over here now! You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My little sister. Thank you. And you! You helped. Well, yeah, a bit. - Harry! - Hermione! Are you all right? You must be freezing. Personally, I think you behaved admirably. I finished last, Hermione. Next to last. Fleur never got past the Grindylows. Krum! Krum! Krum! - Come on! Come on! - Attention! Attention! The winner is Mr. Diggory... ...who showed innate command of the Bubble-Head Charm. However, seeing as Mr. Potter would have finished first... ...had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr. Weasley... ...but the others as well, we've agreed to award him... ...second place... - Second place! - Well done! ...for outstanding moral fiber! Yes! - Right on. - All that moral fiber, eh? - It's great. - Moral fiber? Blimey. Even when you go wrong, it turns out right. - Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber. - Congratulations, Potter. - A fine achievement. - Thank you. Well done, boy. - See you at Hagrid's, Harry. - I'm sorry we haven't spoken. After all, your story is one I've heard so many times. Quite remarkable, really. Tragic, of course... ...to lose one's family. Never whole again, are we? Still, life goes on... ...and here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud of you today, Potter. Bartemius! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the Ministry's summer internships, are we? The last boy who went into the Department of Mysteries never came out! And they say I'm mad. Now, I remember... I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on. Suppose you remind me of meself a little. - And here we all are, four years later. - We're still a bunch of misfits. Well, maybe, but we've all got each other. And Harry, of course. Soon to be the youngest Triwizard champion there's ever been! Hooray! Hogwarts, Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts Teach us something, please Mr. Crouch? A man has died here, Fudge. And he won't be the last. You must take action. I will not. In times like these, the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore! Then for once show them some! The Triwizard Tournament will not be canceled. I will not be seen as a coward! A true leader does what is right, no matter what others think. - What did you say to me? - Excuse me, gentlemen. It may interest you to know this conversation is no longer private. Oh, Harry! Harry, how good to see you again. I can come back later, professor. Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. There you are. Your hat. Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in a little Licorice Snap in my absence. But I have to warn you, they're a wee bit sharp. Professor? - Professor. - Yeah. Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request... ...to present evidence to this council. Should your testimony prove consequential... ...council may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time, you remain in the eyes of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater. Do you accept these terms? - I do, sir. - And what do you wish to present? I have names, sir. There was Rosier, Evan Rosier. - Rosier is dead. - He took a piece of me with him... ...though, didn't he? - I didn't know. - If that is all the witness has to offer... - No, no, no. There was Rookwood! He was a spy. Augustus Rookwood? Of the Department of Mysteries? Yeah, the same. He passed information to You-Know-Who from inside the Ministry itself. Very well. Council will deliberate. In the meantime, you will return to Azkaban. No! Wait, please! Please, I have more! What about Snape? Severus Snape? As the council is aware, I've given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall... ...turned spy for us at great personal risk. - It's a lie! - Today he's no more a Death Eater than I. - Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord! Silence! Unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence... ...this session is now concluded. Oh, no, no, no. I've heard about one more. - What's that? - The name. - Yes? - I know for a fact... ...this person took part in the capture... ...and, by means of the Cruciatus Curse... ...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom and his wife! The name. Give me the wretched name! Barty Crouch... ...Junior. Hold him down! Get your filthy hands off me, you pathetic little men! Hello, Father. You are no son of mine. Curiosity is not a sin, Harry. But you should exercise caution. It's a Pensieve. Very useful if, like me, you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see once more things I've already seen. You see, Harry, I have searched and searched for something... ...some small detail... ...something I might have overlooked... ...something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer, it slips away. It's maddening. Sir? Mr. Crouch's son. What exactly happened to him? He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice. The evidence was overwhelming. - Why do you ask? - It's just that I... I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream, I was in a house. And Voldemort was there, only he wasn 't quite human. And Wormtail was there too. And Mr. Crouch 's son. - Have there been others like this dream? - Yes. Always the same one. Sir, these dreams... ...what I see, you don't think it's actually happening, do you? I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams, Harry. I think it's best if you simply... ...cast them away. It's a sign, Severus. You know what it means as well as I. Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the Black Lake was inspiring. Gillyweed, am I correct? Yes, sir. Ingenious. A rather rare herb, gillyweed. Not something found in your everyday garden. Nor is this. Know what it is? Bubble juice, sir? Veritaserum. Three drops of this and You-Know-Who himself would spill his darkest secrets. The use of it on a student is, regrettably, forbidden. However... ...should you ever steal from my personal stores again... ...my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice. - I haven't stolen anything. - Don't lie to me. Gillyweed may be innocuous, but boomslang skin, lacewing flies? You and your little friends are brewing Polyjuice Potion, and believe me... ...I'm going to find out why! - Yeah! - Yeah! Sonorus! Earlier today, Professor Moody placed the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now, as Mr. Diggory... ...and Mr. Potter... ...are tied for first position... ...they will be the first to enter the maze, followed by Mr. Krum... ...and Miss Delacour. - Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum! The first person to touch the cup will be the winner! I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter. Should, at any point, a contestant wish to withdraw from the task... ...he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants! Gather around. Quickly! In the maze, you'll find no dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead, you'll face something even more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh, find the cup if you can. But be very wary, you could just lose yourselves along the way. Champions, prepare yourselves! Good luck. - My boy. - See you later, Dad. On the count of three. One... Fleur? Fleur. Periculum! Get down! Get down! Expelliarmus! No, don't! Stop! He's bewitched, Cedric! - Get off me! - He's bewitched! Yes. Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry! Reducto! - Thanks. - No problem. You know, for a moment there, I thought you were gonna let it get me. For a moment, so did I. Some game, huh? Some game. Go! Go on, take it. You saved me, take it! - Together. One, two... - Two... ...three! ...three! - You okay? - Yeah. You? Where are we? I've been here before. It's a Portkey. - Harry, the cup is a Portkey. - I've been here before, in a dream. Cedric! We have to get back to the cup. Now! What are you talking about? - Harry! What is it? - Get back to the cup! - Who are you? What do you want? - Kill the spare. - Avada Kedavra! - No! Cedric! Do it! Now! Bone of the father... ...unwillingly given. Flesh of the servant... ...willingly sacrificed. And blood of the enemy... ...forcibly taken. The Dark Lord shall rise... ...again. My wand, Wormtail. Hold out your arm. Master. Thank you, master. The other arm, Wormtail. Welcome, my friends. Thirteen years it's been, and yet... ...here you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself... ...disappointed. Not one of you tried to find me. Crabbe! Macnair! Goyle! Not even you... ...Lucius. My Lord, had I detected any sign, a whisper of your whereabouts... There were signs, my slippery friend. And more than whispers. I assure you, my Lord, I have never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence... ...that is my true mask. I returned. Out of fear, not loyalty. Still, you have proved yourself useful these past few months, Wormtail. Thank you, master. Thank you. - Such a handsome boy. - Don't touch him! Harry. I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. Yeah. I'd introduce you... ...but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend, Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night 13 years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? Yes, shall I? It was love. You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son... ...she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch him. It was old magic. Something I should have foreseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed. I can touch you... ...now. Yeah. Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry? Pick up your wand, Potter. I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up! You've been taught how to duel, I presume, yes? First, we bow to each other. Come on, now, Harry. The niceties must be observed. Dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your manners, would he? I said, bow. - That's better. And now... - No. Crucio! Crucio! Attaboy, Harry. Your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy Muggle mother. Expelliar... I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter. I'm going to destroy you. After tonight, no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight, if they speak of you... ...they'll speak only of how you... ...begged for death. And I, being a merciful Lord... ...obliged. Get up! Don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter! I want you to look at me when I kill you! I want to see the light leave your eyes! Have it your way. - Expelliarmus! - Avada Kedavra! Do nothing! He's mine to finish! He's mine! Harry, when the connection is broken, you must get to the Portkey. We can linger for a moment to give you some time... ...but only a moment. Do you understand? Harry, take my body back, will you? Take my body back to my father. Let go. Sweetheart, you're ready. Let go! Let go! Accio! No! He did it! Harry! Harry! No! No! No, don't! For God's sake, Dumbledore, what's happened? He's back. He's back. Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there. It's all right, Harry. It's all right. He's home. You both are. Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved, Dumbledore. There are too many people. Let me through. Let me through! Let me through! That's my son! That's my boy! It's my boy! - Come on. Get up. Easy, easy! - No. This is not where you want to be right now. Come on. No! It's all right, I got you. I got you. Come on. Easy, now. No! No! Are you all right, Potter? Does it hurt? That? Not so much now. Perhaps I'd better take a look at it. The cup was a Portkey. Someone had bewitched it. What was it like? - What was he like? - Who? The Dark Lord. What was it like to stand in his presence? I don't know. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams... ...into one of my nightmares. Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others? I... I don't think I said anything about a graveyard, professor. ""Marvelous creatures, dragons, aren't they?"" Did you think that miserable oaf would've led you into the woods... ...if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would've told you to open the egg underwater... ...if I hadn't told him first myself? Did you think Neville Longbottom, the witless wonder... ...could've provided you with gillyweed if I hadn't given him the book... ...that led him straight to it? It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the Goblet of Fire. - You bewitched Krum, but you... - ""But... But..."" You won because I made it so, Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the Dark Lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns... ...that I have once and for all... ...silenced the great Harry Potter. Expelliarmus! Severus. That's it, take it. - Do you know who I am? - Albus Dumbledore. - Are you Alastor Moody? Are you? - No. Is he in this room? Is he in this room? Harry, away from there! - You all right, Alastor? - I'm sorry, Albus. That's Moody. But then who's...? Polyjuice Potion. Now we know who's been stealing from your stores, Severus. We'll get you up in a minute. Harry! Barty Crouch Junior. I'll show you mine if you show me yours. Your arm, Harry. You know what this means, don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned. I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it. Send an owl to Azkaban. I think they'll find they're missing a prisoner. - I'll be welcomed back like a hero. - Perhaps. Personally, I've never had much time for heroes. Today, we acknowledge... ...a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was, as you all know... ...exceptionally hard-working... ...infinitely fair-minded... ...and, most importantly... ...a fierce, fierce friend. Now, I think, therefore, you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see... ...Cedric Diggory was murdered... ...by Lord Voldemort! The Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so, I think, would be an insult to his memory. Now, the pain... ...we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me... ...and reminds us... ...that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues... ...our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events... ...the bonds of friendship we've made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that, and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain. You remember that... ...and we'll celebrate a boy who was... ...kind and honest... ...and brave and true, right to the very end. I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year. By accident, of course. I put you in terrible danger this year, Harry. I'm sorry. Professor... ...when I was in the graveyard, there was a moment... ...when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected. Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night, didn't you? They reappeared. No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry. I trust you know that. Dark and difficult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy. But remember this: You have friends here. You're not alone. Hermione. This is for you. Write to me. Promise. Bye. Au revoir, Ron. Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts? - No. - No. No, I didn't think so. Oh, well. What's life without a few dragons? Everything's going to change now, isn't it? Yes. Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you. I won't. You know I won't. - Harry will, won't you? - Yeah. Every week. Subtitles by SDI Media Group , Come on, let's go! Let's go! Hey! Hey, guys! Faster! Hey, what you got under there? - Hey, you want to race? - Oh, please. - Come on! - Come on, let's go! Come on! - Please? - Come on! Let's go! Come on! Come on. Let's go. Go faster! Faster! Sorry, gentlemen. This whole area is closed for weapons testing for the next 24 hours. That includes all on-base personnel. Good afternoon, sir. I'm afraid that goes for you, too, Colonel, sir. The Pentagon sent out revised... Russians. This ain't gonna be easy. Not as easy as it used to be. - Well, we've been through worse. - Yeah? When? Flensburg. There was twice as many. - We were younger. - I still am young! We had guns. Put your hands down, will you? You're embarrassing us. Bet you 500 bucks we can get out of this. Let's call it 100. You recognize building, yes? Drop dead. I'm sorry. I meant drop dead, comrade. - Where was he found? - In Mexico. They were digging in the dirt, looking for this stuff. You're not from around here, are you? Where is it you would imagine I am from, Dr. Jones? Well, the way you're sinking your teeth into those wubble-u's, I should think maybe Eastern Ukraine. Highest marks. Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko. Three times I have received Order of Lenin. Also medal as Hero of Socialist Labor. And why? Because I know things. I know them before anyone else. And what I do not know, I find out. Now, what I need to know now is in here. - You are a hard man to read, Dr. Jones. - Ouch. So, we will do this, what is expression, old-fashioned way. You will tell us. You will help us find what we seek. This warehouse is where you and your government have hidden all of your secrets, yes? This is a military warehouse. I've never been here before in my life. Object we seek, rectangular storage container, dimensions 2 meters by 0.5 meter by 66 centimeters. Contents of box, mummified remains. This is no doubt familiar to you. What makes you think I've got any idea what box you're talking about? Because 10 years ago you were part of the team that examined it. Look... Even if I knew what you were talking about... You will help us find it. Compass. I need a compass. You know, north, south, east... West. No compass? I need your bullets. The contents of that box are highly magnetized. I need gunpowder. You want my help or not? Don't toy with me, Dr. Jones. What is the point of all this? If it's still magnetic, the metal in this gunpowder should point the way. Shells. Give me some shotgun shells. Pliers. Drop the guns, or Colonel Dr. Spalko is dead. Why, Mac? Well, what can I say, Jonesey? I'm a capitalist, and they pay. After all those years we spent spying on the Reds? I thought we were friends, Mac. I've had a run of bad luck with the cards lately, mate. Awful. Bloody awful. I can't go home empty-handed again. No defiant last words, Dr. Jones? I like Ike. Put down gun. You got it, pal. Damn, I thought that was closer. Come on. Come on. He's not to get out of here alive! Block the exits! Don't get clever, Boris. You don't know him. Know him. Know him. You don't know him! You don't know him! You don't know him! You don't know... You did well. Hello? Hello? Hello! Hey. I knocked. You guys got a... Wait a minute. Come on, gang! Oh, that can't be good. All personnel, it is now one minute to zero time. Put on goggles or turn away. Do not remove goggles or face burst until 10 seconds after first light. That can't be good at all. Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Wait! Sure! Great! Don't wait for me! Minus 15 seconds. Minus 10 seconds. Niner, eight, seven, six, fiver, four, three, two, one, zero. I had no reason to believe that Mac was a spy. He was Ml6 when I was in OSS. We did 20, 30 missions together in Europe and the Pacific. Don't wave your war record in our face, Colonel Jones. We all served. No kidding? What side were you on? I don't think you recognize the gravity of your situation. You aided and abetted KGB agents who broke into a top-secret military installation in the middle of the United States of America, my country. What was in the steel box they took? You tell us. You've seen it before. You mean that Air Force fiasco in '47. I was tossed into a bus with blacked-out windows and 20 people I wasn't allowed to speak to. Hauled out in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere on some urgent recovery project and shown what? Pieces of wreckage and an intensely magnetic shroud covering mutilated remains? None of us was ever given the full picture. And we were threatened with treason if we ever talked about it. So, you tell me, what was in the box? Indy, thank God. Don't you know it's dangerous to climb into a refrigerator? Those things can be deathtraps! Good to see you, too, Bob. Relax, boys. I can vouch for Dr. Jones. What the hell is going on? KGB on American soil? Who is that woman? Describe her. Tall, thin, mid-30s, carried a sword of some kind, a rapier, I think. Yeah, that's her. You sure she's here? Here and gone. Who is she? Irina Spalko, she was Stalin's fair-haired girl. His favorite scientist, if you can call psychic research science. General Ross... She's leading teams from the Kremlin all over the world. Scooping up artifacts she thinks might have paranormal military applications. - General Ross! - Back off, Paul. Not everyone in the Army's a Commie and certainly not Indy. What exactly am I being accused of, besides surviving a nuclear blast? Nothing yet. But frankly your association with George McHale makes all your activities suspicious, including those during the war. Are you nuts? Do you have any idea how many medals this son of a bitch won? A great many, I'm sure. But does he deserve them? Dr. Jones, let's just say for now that you are of interest to the Bureau. Of great interest. Grooved Ware in the beginning of modern drainage practices, which we also see in Skara Brae on the west coast of Scotland. Skara Brae dates from 3100 B.C. and was continuously occupied for 600 years until it was apparently abandoned in 2500 B.C. There's no clear evidence as to why its occupants decided to abandon a perfectly healthy environment. Yes? - May I have a moment, Professor? - Yes. Open up Michaelson. Review Chapter 4. When I come back we'll discuss the difference between migration and exodus. What? You have no idea the pressure coming from the Board of Regents. The FBI showed up this morning, ransacked your office, searched all your files! You're the dean of the college. Why didn't you stop them? They have no right. They had every right! They weren't vandals. They were federal agents with search warrants! The university isn't gonna get itself embroiled in that kind of controversy, not in this charged climate. So you're firing me. A leave of absence is all. An indefinite leave of absence. - You are firing me. - During which they've agreed to continue to pay your full salary for a period... I don't want their money! Please don't be foolish. You don't know what I had to go through to get that for you. You went through? What exactly did you have to go through, Charlie? Henry... I resigned. Where will you go? Train to New York, overnight to London, for starts. I might end up teaching in Leipzig. Heinrich owes me a favor. I'll wire you when I get settled. You can send on the rest of my things. I suppose there's nothing to keep you here. I barely recognize this country anymore. The government's got us seeing Communists in our soup. When the hysteria reaches academia, I guess it's time to call it a career. How did Deirdre take the news? How does any wife take such things? The look on her face was a combination of pride and panic. I never should've doubted you, my friend. No, you have reason to question your friends these days. Brutal couple of years, huh, Charlie? First Dad, then Marcus. We seem to have reached the age where life stops giving us things and starts taking them away. Just another half glass. Hey! Hey, old man! Professor, hello! Hey! Are you Dr. Jones? You're running out of platform, kid. Are you a friend of Dr. Oxley's? - Harold Oxley? The archeologist? - Yeah. What about him? They're going to kill him. I haven't talked to Harold Oxley in 20 years. He's a brilliant guy. He could put you to sleep just by talking. Yeah. Yeah. When I was a kid, that's how I did get to sleep. Oxley's voice was better than a glass of warm milk, you know. The name's Mutt, Mutt Williams. - Mutt? What kind of name is that? - Yeah. It's the one I picked. You got a problem with it? Take it easy. What was your relationship to Oxley? My dad died in the war. Ox kind of helped my mom raise me. You were saying somebody's going to kill him? Six months ago, my mom gets a letter from the Ox. He's down in Peru. Found some type of skull, a crystal skull. Like the one that guy Mitchell-Hodgkiss? Hedgkiss? - The one he found. - Nice jacket. The Ox and I were obsessed with the Mitchell-Hedges skull in college. How do you know about it? Are you kidding? It's all he talked about. He'd talk about that thing till the cows come home. What's it? It's like an idol? Deity carving. Mesoamerican. There are a number of crystal skulls in the world. I saw one in the British Museum. Interesting craftsmanship, but that's about it. All right, well, laugh if you want. Oxley said he found it this time. He said this was real and he was off to a place called Akator with it. - Akator? He said that? You're sure? - Yeah. That's what he said. He said Akator. What is it? It's a mythical lost city in the Amazon. Conquistadors called it El Dorado. Supposedly, the Ugha tribe were chosen by the gods 7,000 years ago to build a giant city out of solid gold. It had aqueducts and paved roads and technology that wouldn't be seen again for 5,000 years. Francisco de Orellana disappeared into the Amazon looking for it in 1546. I almost died of typhus looking for it myself. I don't think it exists. Why would Ox want to take the skull there? The legend says that a crystal skull was stolen from Akator in the 15th or 16th century, and that whoever returns the skull to the city temple will be given control over its power. Power. Right. So there's some kind of power. What's the power? I don't know, kid. It's just a story. No. From his letter, my mom thought the Ox was off his rocker. You know, smog in the noggin, so she goes down there to find him, only he'd already been kidnapped. Now they've got her, too. Now, Ox said he hid that skull someplace, and if my mom doesn't come up with it, they're gonna kill them both. Now, she said you'd help me. Me? What's your mom's name again? Mary. Mary Williams. You remember her? There were a lot of Marys, kid. Shut up! That's my mother you're talking about! All right? That's my mother. You don't have to get sore all the time just to prove how tough you are. Sit down. Please. Sit down. She said if anybody could find the skull, it's you. Like you're some type of... Like a grave robber or something. I'm a tenured professor of archeology. Oh, you're a teacher. Well, that's gonna be a big help. Anyway, she called me two weeks ago from South America. Said she'd escaped, but they were after her. She said she'd just gotten a letter from the Ox and mailed it to me so I could give it to you. Then the line went dead. I opened it. I mean, the thing's pointless, though. It's just gibberish. It's not even English lettering. See? See those two bricks over there, at the counter? I don't think they're here for the milkshakes. Who are they? Don't know. Maybe FBI. Come quietly, Dr. Jones. Make that KGB. - And bring letter with you. - Letter? What letter? Letter Mr. Williams just give you. Me? Do I look like a mailman? We don't ask again. Come now or we'll... Or what? Nice try, kid, but I think you just brought a knife to a gunfight. Outside now. - Hit this guy. - Who? Joe College. Hit him hard. - Here, hold this. - What? That's my boyfriend! Take it outside! Get that greaser! Your mom didn't escape. They let her go, so she could mail the letter and you could bring it to me and I could translate it! Get on, gramps! Go, go, go, go, go! Better dead than Red! Better dead than Red! Better dead than Red! Better dead than Red! Better dead than Red! Better dead than Red! This is crazy! Somebody's going to get hurt! Left! Go left! Left! Move, move! Move! Split, split! Split, split! - You're going too fast. - That's a matter of opinion! - Excuse me, Dr. Jones. - Yes? I just had a question on Hargrove's normative culture model. Forget Hargrove. Read Vere Gordon Childe on diffusionism. He spent most of his life in the field. If you want to be a good archeologist, you got to get out of the library! Who is that? Francisco de Orellana, the conquistador. Remember, the guy who got lost looking for the skull. And just as I thought. Koihoma. What's that? It's an extinct Latin American language. Pre-Columbian syllabic base. See. Diagonal stresses on the ideograms. Definitely Koihoma. - You speak it? - Nobody speaks it. It hasn't been heard aloud in 3,000 years. I might be able to read a bit though if I walk it through Mayan first. You know, for an old man, you ain't bad in a fight. Thanks a lot. What are you, like, 80? It's a riddle. Leave it to Ox to write a riddle in a dead language. ""Follow the lines in the earth only gods can read ""which lead to Orellana's cradle ""guarded by the living dead."" - He's talking about the Nazca Lines. - What are those? Hold on here. Geoglyphs. Giant ancient drawings carved into the desert floor in Peru. From the ground, they don't look like anything. But from the sky, only the gods can read them, because only gods live up there. Oxley's telling us the skull is in Nazca, Peru. Finally. They saw him. Ox wandered into town a couple of months ago, raving like a madman. Police locked him up in the sanitarium. It's this way. I took Spanish and I didn't understand a word of that. What was it? Quechua, local Incan dialect. - Where'd you learn that one? - Long story. I got time. I rode with Pancho Villa. A couple of his guys spoke it. Bullshit! - You asked. - Pancho Villa? - Technically, I was kidnapped. - By Pancho Villa? It was the fight against Victoriano Huerta. - How old were you? - About your age. Your parents must've had a cow, huh? It worked out. Things were a little tense at home. Yeah, me and my mom aren't on the best of terms, either. Treat her right, kid. You only get one and sometimes not for that long. It's not my fault. It's hers. She just got P.O.'ed because I quit school. She thinks I'm some kind of goof or something. - You quit school? - Oh, yeah. Sure. Tons of them. Fancy prep schools that teach you how to debate and chess and fencing. I'm great with the blade. I just think it's a waste of time. - You never finished. - No. Just a bunch of useless skills. Wrong books. 'Cause I love reading. Me and Ox used to read all the time. But now I can pick them myself. You get me? - What do you do for money? - Fix motorcycles. Gonna do that for the rest of your life? Maybe I will, Teach. You got a problem with that? No. Not if that's what you love doing. Don't let anybody tell you different. This is it. Sister. She says Ox isn't here. She doesn't know where he is. Some men came and took him away, men with guns. She says he was obsessed, deranged. Drew pictures all over the walls of his cell. This riddle in Oxley's letter doesn't make any sense. ""Follow the lines that only the gods can read that lead to Orellana's cradle."" Cradle, cradle, birth. Orellana wasn't born in Peru. He was born in Spain. He was a conquistador. He came here for the gold. What happened to him? He disappeared along with six others. Their bodies were never found. He must have lost his mind. Ox, man, what happened? What happened? This is not the Mitchell-Hedges skull. Look at the elongated cranium. And the same word in different languages, over and over again. Return. Return where? Or return what? You mean the skull? Seems to have been on his mind. Where was he supposed to return it to? - Sweep. - Yeah. Ox didn't mean Orellana's birthplace. Cradle has another meaning in Mayan. Literally, it means ""resting place,"" as in final resting place. Ox meant Orellana's grave. This drawing scratched into the floor is the cemetery where he's buried. You said Orellana vanished and nobody ever found his grave. Well, it looks like Harold Oxley did. ""Grave robbers will be shot."" Good thing we're not grave robbers. - What are we looking for? - I don't know yet. Maybe an antechamber off one of these barrows. I think I just saw something! Oh, you're jumping at shadows. This way down. - This way up. - Yeah. Those darts are poison! Stay there. You're a teacher? Part-time. Dead end. Maybe. What are you doing? Put that thing away. Give me some light over here. Bring it over here. It's just a thing. Dance on your own dime, will you? One of the scorpions just stung me! Am I gonna die? - How big? - Huge! - Good. - Good? When it comes to scorpions, the bigger the better. A small one bites you, don't keep it to yourself. Their skulls. Look at their skulls, man. Like the drawings in Oxley's cell. Means we're getting closer. That's crazy. Why is it like that? Nazca Indians used to bind their infants' heads with rope to elongate the skull like that. - Why? - Honor the gods. No, no. God's head is not like that, man. Depends on who your god is. You're going nowhere fast. Professor, this really is a dead end. Look. Hey! Come on, genius. Bring the backpack. - This is incredible. - Unreal. Don't touch anything. Footprints. Somebody's been here. Recently. Two sets of prints. Same size, could have been the same person twice. Not bad, kid. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Orellana and his men might've made it out of the jungle after all. Give me some light. You don't have a knife, do you? Looks like he just died yesterday. It's the wrappings. They preserved him. What just happened? He's been wrapped up for 500 years. Air doesn't agree with him. Thanks. I don't want to keep borrowing yours all the time. - That's fine. - I was going to put it back. Is this one open already? It's him. It's Orellana himself. They called him The Gilded Man. His lust for gold was legendary. It's odd. Somebody's been here and gone. But they left all this gold and all the artifacts. What were they looking for? - Hold this. - No. No. Unbelievable. No tool marks. A single piece of seamless quartz. Cut across the grain. It's not possible, even with today's technology, it would shatter. Crystal's not magnetic. Neither is gold. What is this thing? Maybe the Nazca Indians thought this was their god. - You think this is the one from... - From Akator. Maybe the Spaniards found this skull along with all this other loot. They were headed for their ships along the shore. Maybe the Indians caught up with them, or they got to squabbling amongst themselves over their prize, kill each other off. The Indians wrap them up and bury them. A couple of hundred years later, Oxley shows up here, finds the skull. Takes it away, maybe to Akator. But then he returns it here. Return. Return, like he wrote on the walls of his cell. He put it back where he found it. Why? - Hello, Jonesey. - Hello, Mac. You're lucky I turned up, Jonesey. Dovchenko there wanted to blow your brains out. That's the third time I've saved your life. Unshackle me. I'll give you a big hug. You had a Luger pointed at the base of your skull the first time we met. I had the situation under control. - You owe me. - What do you owe them? After the war, when you turned, how many names did you give the Reds? You're not looking at the big picture here. How many good men died because of you? Eventually, they're gonna let me out of this chair, comrade, and when they do, I'm going to break your nose. ""Comrade""? You think this is about flags? About uniforms? You think this is about lines on a map? It's just about money, isn't it? No. Not only money. A gigantic pile of money. Don't worry about what the Russians will pay. It's nothing compared to what's at Akator. An entire city of gold. It's what the conquistadors were after. For God's sake, Jonesey, we'd be rich! Richer than Howard Hughes! Blood money, every nickel. I need you to see the angle here, mate. Be smart. Do the right thing. Just like in... Like in Berlin. Got me? Just like in Berlin. You want me to trot off, or should we sing a song? How fortunate our failure to kill you, Dr. Jones. You survive to be of service to us once again. Well, you know me, always glad to help. ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" You recognize those words? It was your own Dr. Oppenheimer after he created the atomic bomb. He was quoting the Hindu bible. It was nuclear intimidation. But now this next level of weapon is ours to have, yours to fear. Weapon? What weapon? A mind weapon. A new frontier of psychic warfare. That was Stalin's dream. Now I know why Oxley put the skull back where he found it. He knew you were looking for it. That skull is no mere deity carving. Surely you knew that the moment you laid eyes on it. It was not made by human hands. Who made it, then? Come on. The body we found in New Mexico was not the first. We'd already dissected two others from similar crash sites in Soviet Union. Saucer men from Mars. The legends about Akator are all true. Early men could not have conceived it, much less built it. It was a city of supreme beings with technologies and paranormal abilities. You got to be kidding me. Why do you choose not to believe your own eyes? The New Mexico specimen gave us hope. Unlike the others we'd found, its skeleton was pure crystal. A distant cousin, perhaps. Maybe they, too, were sent to find Akator. Perhaps we're all searching for the same thing. - There is no other explanation. - There's always another explanation. The skull was stolen from Akator in the 15th century. Whoever returns it... Returns it to the city temple will gain control over its powers. I've heard that bedtime story before. It's a legend. Why do you think Akator even existed? You should ask your friend that question. We're certain he's been there. Oxley? Ox, it's me, Indy. Ox? Ox, you're faking it, right? ""Through eyes that last I saw in tears..."" Ox, listen to me, pal. Your name is Harold Oxley. You were born in Leeds, England. You and I went to school together at the University of Chicago. And you were never this interesting. My name is... My name is Henry Jones, Jr. What have you done to him? We ain't done a thing. It's the bloody skull. He is the divining rod that will lead us to Akator. But we need someone to interpret him for us. His mind, it seems, is quite weak. Let's hope yours is stronger. The skull's crystal stimulates an undeveloped part of the human brain, opening a psychic channel. Oxley lost control of his mind by staring too long into its eyes. We believe you can get through to him after you have done the same. I've got a better idea. You look at it. The skull does not speak to everyone, it seems. Surely you're not afraid, Dr. Jones. You've spent your entire life searching for answers. Think of the truth behind those eyes. There may be hundreds of skulls at Akator. Whoever finds them will control the greatest natural force the world has ever known. Power over the mind of man. Be careful, you might get exactly what you wish for. I usually do. Imagine. To peer across the world and know the enemy's secrets. To place our thoughts into the minds of your leaders. Make your teachers teach the true version of history, your soldiers attack on our command. We'll be everywhere at once, more powerful than a whisper, invading your dreams, thinking your thoughts for you while you sleep. We will change you, Dr. Jones, all of you, from the inside. We will turn you into us. And the best part? You won't even know it's happening. Return. Return? That's enough. That's enough. If he dies, we can't get there. Cover it. Henry. You all right, Jonesey? - You broke my nose! - I told you. Enough! You will speak to Oxley and lead us to Akator, yes? Take him outside. - You all right, kid? - They left my bike at the cemetery. - Yeah, but you're all right? - They left my bike. Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop. I'm ready. Don't give these pigs a thing. You heard him. Clearly I have chosen the wrong pressure point. Perhaps I can find a more sensitive one. Get your hands off me, you rotten Russki son of a bitch! Indiana Jones. About time you showed up. - Mom! - Sweetheart. ""Mom""? What are you doing here? Forget about me. Are you all right? - ""Mom""? - Young man, I specifically told you - not to come here. - Marion is your mother? You never wrote that. You never said that in any phone calls. Marion Ravenwood is your mother? For God's sake, Indy, it's not that hard. No, I mean, I just never thought... I would have a life after you left. - That's not what I meant. - A damn good life! - Well, that's fine. - A damn good, really good life! - Well, so have I! - Yeah? You still leaving a trail of human wreckage, or have you retired? Why? You looking for a date? With anybody but you. So, Dr. Jones, you will help us? A simple ""yes"" will do. Oh, Marion, you had to go and get yourself kidnapped. Not like you did any better. Same old, same old. Henry Jones, Jr. - Henry Jones, Jr... - That's right, Ox. Listen to me. ""To lay their just hands on that Golden Key - ""that ope's the Palace of Eternity."" - Palace of... It's from Milton. He's said it before. Why? Ox, you got to tell us how to get to Akator or they're gonna kill Marion. ""Through eyes that last I saw in tears, here in death's dream kingdom..."" Harold, they're gonna kill Abner's little girl. Harold, they're gonna kill Abner's little girl. You got to tell us how to get there. We need... Get me paper. Something to write with. Autowriting! I should have seen this. - Henry Jones, Jr. - Right. That's right, Ox. Three times it drops. The way down. - Three times... - Pictographs. Ideograms. Good, Ox. Good. Ox? It's me, Ox. It's Mutt, Ox. Hey, look at me. Look at me. It's me. It's me. The wavy lines mean water, of course. Closed eyes mean sleep. The sun with the arc over the sky stands for time, duration. The word ""now"" is ""until."" These two close together, the horizon and the snake, mean one thought. The horizon stood for the world, but it didn't mean the Earth. It meant big, great. ""The water sleeps until the great snake."" These aren't just drawings, they're directions. Get me a map! The great snake is the Amazon, of course, but ""sleep,"" what water sleeps? Here! Sono. The Portuguese word for ""sleep."" Yes, good. Exactly. He wants us to follow this curve of the Sono down to where it meets the Amazon to the southeast. After that, I'm not sure. Kingdom of dreams, tears and eyes... I have no idea what he means. This could be the route, though. It's a completely unexplored part of the canopy. Go, go, go, go, go! Come on! - Kid, what the hell are we doing, kid? - They were going to kill us! - Well, maybe. - Somebody had to do something! - Something else would have been good. - At least I got a plan. This is intolerable. Harold, for God's sake, keep up. Mom? - Stay back! - Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't move. Moving makes space, space will make you sink. No, I think I can get out if I can just... Stop it! You're pulling against a vacuum. It's like trying to lift a car. Just stay calm. Okay, I'm calm. - What is it? Quicksand? - I'm calm. - No, it's a dry sand pit. - I'm sinking, but I'm calm. Quicksand is a mix of sand, mud and water. And depending on the viscosity, it's not as dangerous - as people sometimes think. - For Pete's sake, Jones, we're not in school! Don't worry. There's nothing to worry about unless there's a... A void collapse. I'll go get something to pull you out. Ox, don't just sit there. For God's sake, man, go get help! - Help? - Help! Help? Help! Go! Mutt can be a little impetuous. It's not the worst quality in the world. Keep your arms above the surface. When the kid comes back, grab on. - Indy, he... - He's a good kid, Marion. You should get off his back about school. - Mutt, I mean... - Not everybody's cut out for it. His name is Henry! Henry. Good name. He's your son. My son? Henry Jones the Third. Why the hell didn't you make him finish school? - Mom, grab on! Grab it! - Yeah. I got it. Come on, Mom! Pull, pull, pull, pull! Pull! Grab on. - Grab it. - Just grab it, Indy. It's a rat snake! - Rat snakes aren't that big. - Well, this one is, all right? It's not even poisonous. Now grab on! - Go get something else. - Like what? Like a rope or something. There's no Sears and Roebuck here! Grab the snake! - Maybe I can touch the bottom. - There's no bottom. Now grab it. No, I think I can feel it with my feet. - Grab the snake! - Stop calling it that! It's a snake! What do you want me to call it? - Say ""rope."" - What? Say ""grab the rope."" - Grab the rope! - Grab the rope! Hold tight. It's slimy. Pull! Get rid of that thing, will you, Son? Afraid of snakes. You are one crazy old man. Why do you have to do everything the hard way, Jonesey? Good work, Ox. Thanks. Help. No. No, he was British. My dad was an RAF pilot. He was a war hero, not some schoolteacher! No, sweetheart. Colin was your stepfather. We started dating when you were three months old. He was a good man. Wait, wait, wait. Colin? As in Colin Williams? You... You married him? I introduced you! I think you gave up your vote on who I married when you decided to break it off a week before the wedding! I think we both knew, Marion, it wasn't going to work. You didn't know that. Why didn't you ever talk to me about it? Because we never had an argument I won! It's not my fault if you can't keep up! I didn't want to hurt you! For love of God, shut the hell up! Didn't you ever wonder years ago why Ox stopped talking to you? He hated that you ran away. Would you two just stop? Yeah, Marion, let's not let the kid see mom and dad fight. - You're not my dad, okay? - You bet I am. And I got news for you. You're gonna go back and finish school. Really? What happened to, ""There's not a damn thing wrong with it, kid, ""and don't let anybody else tell you any different""? You don't remember saying that? That was before I was your father! - You're not my father! - Oh, yes, he is your father. You should have told me about the kid, Marion. I had a right to know. You vanished after that. - I wrote. - A year later! By then, Mutt was born and I was married! Why are you bothering to tell me now? Because I thought we were gonna die! Not yet! Got it? Oh, shit. I'm sure I wasn't the only one to go on with my life. There must've been plenty of women for you over the years. Yeah. There were a few, but they all had the same problem. Yeah? What's that? They weren't you, honey. We got to get Oxley back, get our hands on that skull and get to Akator before they do. Grab the wheel. What's he gonna do now? - I don't think he plans that far ahead. - Yeah. - Scooch over, will you, Son? - Don't call me ""son."" Don't. I think I'd cover my ears if I were you. Duck! Duck! Move, move! Pull up next to that duck. Henry Jones, Jr. Jones! Come on! Come on! Get down! Ox has got the skull. Marion, take the wheel. That's not fair. She drove the truck. Don't be a child. Find something to fight with. Jonesey! - Jonesey! - Hi, Mac. - Indy. Indy! Indy! - Shut up! Shut up! - You stupid son of a bitch! I'm CIA. - CIA. I almost screamed it at you in the tent. I said, ""Just like Berlin."" What were we in Berlin, mate? - Double agents! - The skull! Throw me the skull! Throw me the skull! Riposte. Riposte. Get on your front foot. Riposte. It's not a match, Mom. You fight like a young man, eager to begin, quick to finish. Mutt, disengage! Hey! Hey, I got the skull! - Throw the bag! Throw it! - Throw the bag! - Gun! - Gun! What are you looking at, Daddy-o? She's getting away! This is very dangerous. Do svidanya, Dr. Jones. Jones! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! Turn! - Siafu. - What? Big damn ants! Go! Run to the river! Get to the river! Jump in! Come on! Come on! Mom, there's a cliff! - Jonesey, come on! - Get in, Jones! - Mom, stop. - Mom, slow down. - Honey, stop. - Slow down, Mom. - You're gonna go off the cliff. - That's the idea. - Bad idea. Give me the wheel. - Trust me! Slow down! - Don't ever do that again. - Yes, dear. Three times it drops. Reverse. Put it in reverse! Full reverse! - I'm trying! I'm trying! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mom! The way down. He means by land. He came by land. - Three times it drops? - Three times it drops. What is he talking about? He means one! Two! Three. You okay? Babe? Let go. ""Through eyes that last I saw in tears."" ""The golden vision reappears!"" Gold. I'm in. Through eyes... Through eyes in tears. We got to go through that waterfall! The skull has to be returned. I'll do it. Nobody else has to come. Who cares? It's brought us nothing but trouble. Look what it did to him. - I have to return it. - Why you? Because it told me to. - Ochre, iron oxide, charcoal. - Oxy, stay with us. How old is this? Four or five thousand years. Old as the pyramids. Look, sun worshippers, like the Egyptians. This is fresh. These were just used. More worshippers. Yeah, but that's not the sun they're worshipping. Someone came and taught the Ugha farming. Irrigation. Ox, what is it? I think I understand, Ox. Someone came? Are they the same? There were more. Look. Thirteen in a circle. Show us the way, Ox. - Let's go. Go, go, go! Run! Run, go! - Go! Indy! Jonesey! Oxley! You were here before. How did you get past them? Come on, Mac. Come on! Come on, Mac. Come on, come on, come on. ""To lay their just hands on that Golden Key - ""that ope's the Palace of Eternity."" - Come on, Ox. You did good, Ox. You did good. City of gold. So where's all the gold? Look at the state of this place. What a stupid legend. What a waste of my time. Ox was here before, but he couldn't get into the temple, so he took the skull back to the cemetery, where he found it. ""To lay their just hands on that Golden Key ""that ope's the Palace of Eternity."" Key that ope's the palace. The obelisk. The obelisk is the key? What are you looking for, Ox? What are you doing? You figured this out in your cell, didn't you, Professor? Excuse me, Professor. Well done. Go get your own. Listen. Hear that? Get up! Move! Ox, move! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! This is not good. Move, Ox! Move! Quick! Quick! Quick! I don't like this! I don't like it! - Mom, come on! - Jonesey! He dropped it. He dropped the skull! Okay? Hold this. Ox, you okay? Lovely. All right, let's go. This way? Now that's more like it. There are artifacts from every era of early history. Macedonian. - Sumerian. - This place is the mother lode. Etruscan. Babylonian. There isn't a museum in the world that wouldn't sell its soul for this lot. Early Egyptian. Dozens of museums. Hundreds of them, Jonesey! Collectors. They were archeologists. How do we open it? I'll give it back, Ox. I promise. No more forever waiting. Soon now. Sorry, Jonesey. So what are you, a triple agent? Nah, I just lied about being a double. Look at them! Still waiting for the return of the one who was lost. They are a hive mind. One being physically separate, but with a collective consciousness. More powerful together than they can ever be apart. Imagine what they could tell us. I can't imagine. Neither could the humans that built this temple, and neither can you. Belief, Dr. Jones, is a gift you have yet to receive. My sympathies. Oh, I believe, sister. That's why I'm down here. - Mayan. He's speaking Mayan. - What does he say? He says he's grateful and he wants... It. It wants to give us a gift. A big gift. Tell me everything you know. I want to know everything. I want to know. I've got a bad feeling about this. Indy? The eyes. What are they? Spacemen? Interdimensional beings, in point of fact. Welcome back, Ox. What the hell is that? A portal! A pathway to another dimension! I don't think we want to go that way. I want to know. I want to know. Tell me. I'm ready. I want to know. Mac! Mac! Come on! Mac! Mac, damn it, now! I can see. I can see! Grab it! Use your legs, Mac. I can't do it alone. Jonesey! I'm going to be all right. No more! Cover it. Cover it. Go! Enough! Enough! Go! Go! Like a broom to their footprints. Where did they go? Space? Not into space. Into the space between spaces. I don't understand. Why this legend of a city of gold? The Ugha word for gold translates as ""treasure."" But their treasure wasn't gold. It was knowledge. Knowledge was their treasure. What? We're just going to sit here? Night falls quick in the jungle, kid. You don't want to climb down the mountain in the dark. No? I can. Who's coming with me? Come on. Why don't you stick around, Junior? I don't know. Why didn't you, Dad? Dad! Dad? Somewhere your grandpa is laughing. Marvelous! Perfect! Make the letters bigger, much bigger. Henry Jones, Jr., and Marion Ravenwood, insomuch in that you two have agreed to live together in holy matrimony, have promised your love for each other by these vows the joining of your hands and the giving of these rings, I now declare you to be husband and wife. Whom God hath put together, let no one tear asunder. ""How much of human life is lost in waiting!"" Congratulations. You may kiss your bride. Well done, Henry! - Thanks, Ox. - Thanks, Ox. Subtitles by LeapinLar, You've reached Doug. Sorry I missed your call. Please leave a name and number and I'll get back to you. Hi, you've reached... ...Dr. Stuart Price with Divine Dentistry. Please leave a message after... Hey, this is Phil. Leave me a message or don 't. Do me a favor, don 't text me. It's gay. - Anything? - I tried them all. It keeps going straight to voicemail. Well, there has to be an explanation. Sweetie, it's Vegas. You lose track of time in casinos. There's no windows, there's no clocks. He's probably on a heater. And you never walk away from the table when you're on a heater. You do if you're getting married. - Hello? - Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil. Phil, where the hell are you guys? I'm freaking out. Yeah, listen. Uh... We fucked up. What are you talking about? The bachelor party, the whole night. It... Things got out of control, uh... ...and we lost Doug. - What? - We can't find Doug. What are you saying, Phil? We're getting married in five hours. Yeah. That's not gonna happen. To my left a little. Thank you. Okey-dokey. - Whoa, watch it, pervert! - Alan, he's just doing your inseam. - He's getting very close to my shaft. - All done. You can change now. Right. Thanks, Floyd. Thank you very much. All right, buddy, we should get a move on. You know, Doug, I was thinking... If you wanna go to Vegas without me, that is totally cool, you know? What are you talking about? You know, Phil and Stu, they're your buddies, and it's your bachelor party. Come on, Alan. Those two love you. And also, I don't want you to feel like you have to hold back... ...because your wife's brother's there. I just... It's not like that. It's not like that. I already told you, Alan. Okay? We're just spending the night in Vegas. It's no big deal. Besides, you're not just my wife's brother, you're my brother now. I want you to know, Doug, I'm a steel trap. Whatever happens tonight, I will never, ever, ever, speak a word of it. Okay. Yeah, I got it. Thank you. I don't think that... Seriously. I don't care what happens. - I don't care if we kill someone. - What? You heard me. It's Sin City. I won't tell a soul. Okay. I got it. Thank you. No, thank you. I love you so much. No. Sid. - Really? - Come on, we're family now. - You sure? I mean, you love this car. - Doug, it's just a car. Just make sure to put some Armor All on the tires so the sand doesn't seep in. Absolutely. That's easy. Oh, and, uh, don't let Alan drive... ...because there's something wrong with him. - Understood. - Oh, and Phil either. I don't like him. I will be the only one driving this car. I promise. Good. Remember, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Ah! Except for herpes. That shit'll come back with you. All right. Hold on. I still need some of your permission slips... ...and $90 for the field trip to the Griffith Observatory next weekend. Pay now, or forever regret missing out on the experience of a lifetime, guys. You're good, you got it. - Thanks, Mr. Wenneck. - Thank you, Russ. Thanks. Thanks, Bobbitt, way to go. Hold on, I got it. Ahem, do you have to park so close? - Yeah. What's wrong? - I shouldn't be here. Why is that, Alan? I'm not supposed to be within 200 feet of a school. - What? - Or a Chuck E. Cheese. - Mr. Wenneck, I was... - It's the weekend. I don't know you. You do not exist. - Shit. - Heh, heh, heh. - Nice car. - Yeah. I'm driving. Whoa, no chance, buddy... Don't step... God. Watch the leath... Shut up and drive before these nerds ask me another question. - Animal. - Who's this? - It's Alan. Tracy's brother. - I met you, like, four times. Oh, yeah. How you doing, man? Don't forget your Rogaine. Rogaine, check. And don't forget to use it. I can totally tell when you forget, your hair just looks thinner. Using of the Rogaine, check. Make sure to call me right when you get to the hotel... ...not like that conference in Phoenix. I had to wait two hours for you to call me. Yeah, I was the keynote speaker. I was late to the podium. - Still? - Yeah, you're totally right. I'm sorry. - What is the matter? - I don't know. I hope you're not gonna go to some strip club when you're up there. Melissa, we're going to Napa Valley. I don't even think they have strip clubs in wine country. Well, I'm sure if there is one, Phil will sniff it out. It's not gonna be like that. Besides, you know how I feel about that. I know, I know. It's just boys and their bachelor parties, it's gross. You're right, it is gross. - Not to mention it's pathetic. - Mm-hm. - Those places are filthy. - Yeah. And the worst part is... ...that little girl... ...grinding and dry humping the fucking stage up there... ...that's somebody's daughter up there. - I was just gonna say that. See? I just wish your friends were as mature as you. They are mature, actually. You just have to get to know them better. Paging Dr. Faggot. Dr. Faggot! - I should go. - That's a good idea, Dr. Faggot. Have a good weekend. I'm gonna miss you. Whoo! Road trip! Vegas! Vegas, baby! Vegas! You're nuts! Come on, just till Barstow. Everybody's passing us. Absolutely not. I promised Sid. I will be the only one driving this car. Besides, you're drinking. Oh, what are you, a cop now? You know I drive great when I'm drunk. True. Don't forget, Phil was always our designated drunk driver. Yeah. You wanna explain it to them, Alan? Guys, my dad loves this car more than he loves me, so, yeah. Aw, whatever. I left my wife and kid at home so I could go with you guys. - You know how difficult that was? - That's really sweet. - Yeah. - Dude, I was being sarcastic. I fucking hate my life. I may never go back. I might stay in Vegas. Here we go. Doug, enjoy yourself, because come Sunday... ...you're gonna start dying just a little bit every day. Yeah. That's why I've managed to stay single this whole time, you know? - Oh, really? That's why you're single? - Yeah. Cool. Good to know. - Am I all right over there, Alan? - Yeah, you're good. Aw, Jesus Christ! - Oh, my God! - That was awesome! That was not awesome. What's wrong with you? - That was insane. We almost just died. - You should have seen your face. - Classic. - That's funny. Ha-ha. It's not funny. - Boy, you've got a sweet ride there. - Don't touch it. Don't even look at it. Go on, get out. You heard me. Don't look at me, either. Yeah, you better walk on. - He's actually kind of funny. - Yeah, he means well. I'll hit an old man in public. Is he all there? Like, mentally? I think so. He's just an odd guy. You know, he's kind of weird. - I mean, should we be worried? - No. - All right. - No. Tracy did mention that we shouldn't let him gamble. Or drink too much. Jesus, he's like a gremlin. Comes with instructions and shit. And one water. - All good with Melissa? - Oh, yeah. Told her we're two hours outside of wine country, and she bought it. You think it's strange you've been in a relationship for years... ...and you have to lie about Vegas? Yeah, I do. But trust me, it's not worth the fight. Oh, so you can't go to Vegas... ...but she can fuck a bellhop on a Carnival Cruise Line? Hey. Okay, first of all, he was a bartender. And she was wasted. And, if you must know, he didn't even come inside her. And you believe that? Uh, yeah, I do believe that, because she's grossed out by semen. That'll be 32.50. It's 32.50, you gonna pay for it? It says here we should work in teams. Who wants to be my spotter? I don't think you should be doing too much gambling tonight, Alan. Gambling? Who said anything about gambling? It's not gambling when you know you're gonna win. Counting cards is a foolproof system. It's also illegal. It's not illegal, it's frowned upon, like masturbating on an airplane. I'm pretty sure that's illegal too. Yeah, maybe after 9/11, where everybody got so sensitive. Thanks a lot, Bin Laden. Either way, you gotta be super smart to count cards, buddy, okay? - Oh, really? - It's not easy. Well maybe we should tell that to Rain Man... ...because he practically bankrupted a casino, and he was a retard. What? He was a retard. Retard. Here we go. Hi, welcome to Caesars. - Hello. - Checking in? Yeah. We have a reservation under Dr. Price. Okay, let me look that up for you. Dr. Price? Stu, you're a dentist, okay? Don't try and get fancy. - It's not fancy if it's true. - He's a dentist. Don't get too excited. And if, uh, someone has a heart attack, you should still call 911. We'll be sure to do that. Can I ask you a question? Do you know if the hotel's pager-friendly? - What do you mean? - I'm not getting a sig on my beeper. - I'm not sure. - Is there a payphone bank? Bunch of payphones? Business. Um, there's a phone in your room. That'll work. So I have you in a two-bedroom suite on the 12th floor, is that okay? It sounds perfect. Actually, I was wondering if you had any villas. - We're not even gonna be in the room. - It's unnecessary. No big deal. We can share beds. It's one night. If we're share beds, I'm bunking with Phil. - You good with that? - No, I'm not. Guys, we are not sharing beds. What are we, 12 years old? Lisa, I apologize. How much is the villa? Well, we have one villa available, and it's 4200 for the night. - Is it awesome? - It's pretty awesome. - We'll take it. Give her your credit card. - I can't give her my credit card. - We'll split it. - Are you crazy? No, this is on us. You don't get it. Melissa checks my statements. We just need a credit card on file. We won't charge you until check out, so you can figure it out then. That's perfect. Thank you, Lisa. We'll deal with it tomorrow. Come on. Fine. - Can I ask you another question? - Sure. You probably get this a lot. This isn't the real Caesars Palace, is it? What do you mean? Did, uh... - Did Caesar live here? - Um, no. I didn't think so. Holy shit. Now, this is Vegas. Oh, my... This place is enormous. Now we're talking. Is this all one suite? Thank you, guys. Or should I say, ""Thank you, Stu""? You're welcome. It's only because I love you. Okay, ladies, pick a room, get dressed. Let's be ready in 30 minutes. I just wish you could see this place, because you, of all people, would love it. Yeah. No, it's so quaint. Yeah, no, there's no TVs, no phones. They just have these cute little antique radios in all the rooms. Yeah. What else? Um... We met the, uh, proprietor. - Oh, I bet you... - What's his name? Um, Caesar. Palac. Yeah, like the salad. Okay. Well, listen, I gotta go, because we're gonna hit this wine tasting. Wait, wait. I love you. Okay. Bye. I'm not even gonna say anything, it's so embarrassing. - Where's Alan? - He, uh, he went downstairs. He said he had to grab a few things. Good, because I have something to show you. Uh-Oh. - What the hell is that? - What do you think? If it's what I think it is, I think it's a big fucking mistake. I'm gonna propose to Melissa at your wedding. After the ceremony. - Stuey, congratulations! - Thank you, Doug. - That's a beautiful ring. - Yeah. It's my grandmother's. She made it all the way through the Holocaust with that thing. Wait, have you not listened to anything I have ever said? Phil, we've been dating for three years. It's time. This is how it works. A, that is bullshit. And B, she is a complete bitch. Hey, that's his fiance. What? It's true. It's true. You know it's true. She beats him. That was twice, and I was out of line. She's strong-willed. And I respect that. Wow. Wow. He's in denial. Not to mention, she fucked a sailor. Hey, he wasn't a sailor. He was a bartender on a cruise ship. You know that. Guys, I'm standing right here. So I can hear everything that you're saying. Hey, guys. You ready to let the dogs out? - What? - Do what? Let the dogs out. You know. Who brought this guy? Yes, Alan, we are ready to let the dogs out. - Hey, congrats. - Thank you. I love this fucking town. - You're not really wearing that, are you? - Wearing what? The man-purse. You're actually gonna wear that or are you guys fucking with me? It's where I keep all my things. I get a lot of compliments on this. Plus, it's not a man-purse. It's called a satchel. Indiana Jones wears one. So does Joy Behar. - We're going up, guys. - Yeah, that's perfect. Really? We're going up? I'm just saying, it's clearly marked, okay? We are definitely not supposed to be up here. Come on, we're paying for a villa. We can do whatever the fuck we want. - Yeah, but... - Just wedge the door open. - Guys, come on up here. - Fine. How the hell did you find this place? Don't worry about it. Oh! - You all right? - Yeah. - Look at the view up here. - You happy? - This is great. - Whoa! Are you kidding? - Alan, how we doing, buddy? - Good. What do you got over there, Alan? That's the Eiffel Tower. Uh-oh. - Right? - A little Jgermeister. - Good idea. - There it is. Good call. On the roof. Um, no, this is good. I'd like to make a toast. To Doug and Tracy. May tonight be... ...but a minor speed bump... ...in an otherwise very long and healthy marriage. - Cheers. - Cheers. Short and sweet. Oh, it's like college. - All right. I wanna talk about something. - All right. - I want to... - I'd like to... I'd like to say something... ...that I prepared... ...tonight. - All right, Alan. ""Hello. How about that ride in? I guess that's why they call it Sin City. You guys might not know this, but I consider myself a bit of a loner. I tend to think of myself as a one-man wolf pack. But when my sister brought Doug home, I knew he was one of my own. And my wolf pack, it grew by one. So were there two... So there were two of us in the wolf pack. I was alone first in the pack, and then Doug joined in later. And six months ago... ...when Doug introduced me to you guys, I thought: 'Wait a second. Could it be?' And now, I know for sure. I just added two more guys to my wolf pack."" - All right. - All right. ""Four of us wolves... ...running around the desert together in Las Vegas... ...Iooking for strippers and cocaine."" So tonight... ...I make a toast. - Whoa. - What...? - What do you got there? - Dude, what the fuck? - What the hell are you doing? - What is that? - Blood brothers. - Don't... Why did you...? - Damn it. - Here. - Alan... - No. - No, I'm not doing that. - Go ahead, Stuart. - Make him stop. Alan, we're not gonna cut ourselves. Give me the knife. Slowly. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. - You all right? Are you okay? - Mm-hm. - Do you need a doctor? - He's good. - You sure? - I'm good. - Perfect. Alan, come here, buddy. - Get in here, crazy. All right, to a night the four of us will never forget. - There it is. - Hear, hear. Hey, thanks, guys. Hm. Stupid tiger. What the fuck? Control yourself, man. Goddamn, will you put on some pants? - Phil, do not go in the bathroom. - AI, just calm down. It's me. Phil, there is a tiger in the bathroom. - What's going on? - There's a jungle cat in the bathroom! - Okay, okay, Al. Al, I'll check it out. - Don't go in. Don't go in, don't go in. Be careful. Don't, don't. - Oh! Holy fuck! He's not kidding. - See? See? - There's a tiger in there. - No, there isn't. Yeah! - It's big. Gigantic. - You okay, buddy? No. I am in so much pain right now. Goddamn. Look at this place. Whew. I know. Phil, they have my credit card downstairs. I am so screwed. How does a tiger get in the bathroom? It almost killed me. Hey, bro? You mind putting on some pants? I find it a little weird I have to ask twice. Pants at a time like this? I don't have any p... What the fuck happened last night? Hey, Phil, am I missing a tooth? I can't... Oh, shit. Oh, my God. My lateral incisor's... It's gone! It's okay. Okay, okay. Just calm down. We're fine. Everything's fine. Alan, go wake up Doug. Let's get some coffee and get the fuck out of Nevada... ...before housekeeping shows. What am I gonna tell Melissa? I lost a tooth. I have no idea how it happened. You're freaking me out, man. I got a massive headache, okay? Let's just calm down. How am I supposed to calm down? Look around you. - Hey, guys, he's not in there. - Did you check all the rooms? Yeah, I looked everywhere. Plus, his mattress is gone. He probably went to the pool to get something to eat. I'll just call his cell. I look like a nerdy hillbilly. - Hello? - Alan. Hey. - It's Phil. - Oh, hey, Phi... This is Doug's phone. This is Doug's phone. - No shit. - Yeah. What the fuck is that? Whose fucking baby is that? Alan, are you sure you didn't see anyone else in the suite? Yeah, I checked all the rooms. No one's here. Check its collar or something. Shh. Shh. - It's okay, baby. - Stu, we don't have time for this. Let's go hook up with Doug, we'll deal with the baby later. Phil, we're not gonna leave a baby in the room. - There's a fucking tiger in the bathroom. - It's not our baby. Yeah, I gotta side with Stu on this one. All right, fine. Okay, we'll take it with us. Could you at least just find some pants? Why can't we remember a goddamn thing from last night? Because we obviously had a great fucking time. Why don't you just stop worrying for one minute. Be proud of yourself. Oh, how cute. What's his name? - Ben. - Carlos. Carlos? Thank you. Hey, Phil, look. He's jacking his little weenis. - Pull yourself together, man. - Not at the table, Carlos. I looked everywhere. Gym, casino, front desk. Nobody's seen Doug. He's not here. He's fine. He's a grown man. Seriously, Stu, you gotta calm down. Here, have some juice. I can't have juice right now. Okay. All right. Let's just track this thing. What's the last thing we remember doing last night? Well, the first thing was we were on the roof... ...and were having those shots of Jger. And then we ate dinner at The Palm. Right? That's right. And then we played craps at the Hard Rock, and I think Doug was there. That sounds right. No, no. He definitely was. You know what, guys? I don't even remember going to dinner. What the fuck? I don't think I've ever been this hung-over. After the Hard Rock, I blacked out. It was like emptiness. Okay. We have up until 10 p. m... ...so that gives us a 12-hour window where we could have lost him. - What is this? - Oh, my God. That is my tooth. Why do you have that? What else is in your pockets? This is a good thing. No. Check your pockets. Check your pockets. Do you have anything? I have an ATM receipt from the Bellagio. Eleven-oh-five for $800! I am so fucked. I have a valet ticket from Caesars. - 15 a.m. Oh, shit. We drove last night? Driving drunk. Classic. What's on your arm? - What the fuck is that? - Jesus, Phil. - You were in the hospital last night. - I guess so, yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, Alan. I'm fine. What the hell is going on? Well, Stu, Stu, this is a good thing. We have a lead now. Hey, Stu, watch this. - You ever seen a baby do that? - Dude, Alan, not cool. So, uh, are you sure you're qualified to be taking care of that baby? What? I've found a baby before. - You found a baby before? - Yeah. - Where? - Coffee Bean. Wait, what? Hey, Phil? I don't think Doug would want us to take the Mercedes. Relax, we'll be careful. My dad is crazy about that car. He left Doug in charge... Alan. We got bigger problems here. Doug could be in the hospital, he could be hurt. - Let's worry about the car later. - Uh, guys? Check it out. All right, grab it from the other side. Is that the mattress from Doug's room? What the fuck? Hey, man, what's going on here? Some asshole threw his bed out the window last night. - No shit. - Yeah. Some guys just can't handle Vegas. Ha-ha. Oh, God. It's gonna be okay, Stu. How the hell did we manage that? - Here's your car, officers. - Oh, God. All right, everybody act cool. All right, don't say a word. Come on, let's just get in and go. Come on. - Stu, you got a five? - No. - I'll hit you on the way back. - Thank you, sir. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You just nailed the baby. Are my glasses okay? Your glasses are fine, dick. This is so illegal. Can't you see the fun part in anything? Yeah, we're stuck in traffic in a stolen police car... ...with a missing child in the back seat. Which part of this is fun? - I think the cop-car part's pretty cool. - Thank you, Alan. It is cool. Doug would love it. Come on. - Check this out. - Oh, no. No, Phil. No, Phil. Don't do this! - Take it easy. - Just try to call more attention to us. - Attention. - Sorry. Attention, please. Move out of the way. I repeat, please disperse. Phil, stop the car, I wanna get out. Stop the car, I wanna get out. Pull over. Ma'am, in the leopard dress, you have an amazing rack. Get off the sidewalk! Get off the sidewalk! I should have been a fucking cop. Look, I already told you. You came in with a mild concussion, some bruised ribs. No big deal. Although none of you could articulate how it happened. Do you remember how many of us were here? Ah... I don't know. I think it was just you guys. Definitely no baby. - And one other guy. - That's our guy. Was he okay? Yeah. He was fine. Just whacked out of his mind. You all were. All right, come forward. And turn. All right. There you go. And cough. Cough. Cough. Give me one more. All right. Thattaboy. Okay, Felix, you can put your robe on. And the nurse will be in here in a minute. I'll see you after the weekend. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Guys, I really gotta go. I'm sorry. I have a surgery up on the fourth floor. No, I know. But we just need a couple more minutes of your time. Yeah. Tuck it right in there. I don't want to re-sterilize. Walk with me. Okay, here we go. Patient name, Phil Wenneck, 2:45 a.m. arrival. Minor concussion, like I said. Some bruising. Pretty standard. Do you mind if I look? I'm actually a doctor. Yeah, you said that several times last night. But really, you're just a dentist. Okay, this is interesting. Your blood work came in this morning. Wow. They found a large amount of Ruphylin in your system. Ruphylin. Roofies. Commonly known as the date-rape drug. What, so, what are you saying, I was raped last night? Actually... I don't think so. But someone did slip you the drug. I'm not surprised you don't remember anything. Doc, none of us can remember anything from last night. Remember? Yeah. How could someone have drugged all of us? I wouldn't worry about it. The stuff's out of your system. You're gonna be fine. Wait, wait, wait. Please, doctor. Is there anything else? Like, something we may have been talking about... ...or some place we were going? Actually, there was something. You guys kept talking about some wedding last night. Yeah. No shit. Our buddy Doug's getting married tomorrow. - You know what? I want the 100 back. - No, no. Easy. You kept talking about some wedding you just came from. At the, uh, Best Little Chapel. You kept saying how sick the wedding was and getting all crazy about it. Okay, I hope this helps. I really have to leave. Best Little Chapel, do you know where that is? I do. It's at the corner of Get A Map and Fuck Off. I'm a doctor, not a tour guide. Figure it out yourself, okay? You're big boys. What about the baby? Leave him in the car. We're gonna be five minutes. Whoa, we're not leaving a baby in the car. He'll be fine. I cracked the window. - What if they don't remember us? - Well, let's just find out. I'm sor... Excuse me, sir? Hi. Look at these guys. What happened? You miss me? You miss Eddie? You want more from me? How are you, my friend? Look at this guy. You're fucking crazy. What's going on, man? Listen, I'm gonna tell you something. I know some sick people in my life. This guy is the craziest, wildest bastard I ever met in my life, man. - This guy? - This guy is out of his mind. What's going on, you fucking crazy motherfucker? I thought he was gonna eat my dick. What happened? No love for Eddie? You don't hug me? No, no. It's not that, Eddie. Uh, it's just that we're having a hard time remembering... ...what happened here last night. Yeah, was there a wedding here? Do you do weddings here? You are cracking my balls, man. Obviously we were here. We're looking for our friend Doug. - Do you remember? - Yeah, the small guy. Like a monkey. - Yeah. - You saw him? Of course. Is there anything you can tell us about what may have happened last night? You don't remember nothing? - Congratulations, Stu, you got married. - This... This can't be happening. - Oh, God. - Look at that. I'll tell you one thing, you look seriously happy here, man. That's it. My life is over. Stu, it's okay. Look, shit happens. Come on. Melissa's not gonna know anything about this. - This never happened. I'll take care of it. - Come on. Put it here. Hey, what's all that? The High Roller package. It's what you ordered. I have coffee mugs. - What? - You have baseball caps, huh? And fancy calendars, all with pictures of Stu and Jade. Her name's Jade? Yeah, and she's beautiful, man. Clean, very tight. Tits like that. - But that's because she had a baby. - That explains the baby. - Oh, Carlos. Carlos. - Great. All right. Uh, here's the deal. We made a mistake last night. We need this marriage annulled. You do annulments? Of course I do. It breaks my heart and gonna make me sad... ...but it's no problem. Good price for you. I can't do it with just him, though. I need the chick. I need both parties. Oh, not a problem. That's great. Isn't that great, Stu? Come on, buddy. She probably knows where Doug is. - Awesome. - All right, all right. Okay. Uh... We need her address. She filled out some paperwork, right? Of course. Hey. Excuse me. What is the matter with you? Go and get the paperwork, man. I spend my life waiting for you. Come on. Okay. I'm going. And get the baklava, please. - Hey, Phil, what about my dad's car? - I'm sure Doug has it. We'll get it back. Then I vote we torch the cop car and all this shit with it. - Torch it? Who are you? - I don't know, Phil. Apparently I'm a guy who marries complete strangers. This whole situation is completely fucked. - These mugs. This hat. This car. - Hey! It's all evidence of a night that never happened. That is why we're torching all of it. Whoa, I'm a schoolteacher, I got a family, okay? I'm all for secrecy, but I'm not gonna torch a cop car. - Fine. I'll do it. - Can I help? Yeah, thanks. - Is it Doug? - I don't have it. It's Doug, it's Doug. Uh, it's Melissa. - Don't answer. - I have to. She's called twice already! - Can I ride shotgun? - Don't touch me. Hey, sweetheart, how are you? There you are. This is the third time I'm trying you. I know. The reception up here's crazy. I think it's all the sequoia trees, block the signal. Ugh, I hate that. So how was it last night? Ah, it was really fun, actually. It was quiet, but it was a good time. That sounds nice. - I'm learning all kinds of vino factoids. - Hi. lt'd be so cool if I could breast-feed, you know? Well, listen... ...we're about to go for a tractor ride. - What the fuck? - I should get going. So pretty. - A tractor ride? - Go, out of the car! - What was that? They started up the tractor. I think it backfired. - Where the hell is he? - Hey, easy, easy. I think we're looking for the same guy, okay? Hey! What the hell, man? What the fuck, Stu? Is that a baby? Why would there be a baby? We're at a winery. That's a goat. Where is he? I don't know! What are you talking about? Sir, can you please start the tractor so we can get out of here? I'm trying to, but we're fucking blocked. Oh, my God! What the hell is happening, Stu? - Hey! There's a baby on board! - Someone just said ""baby."" - Get out of the car! - It's a baby goat. Why you making trouble for my business, man? - Go away from here. - Get out of the car! - Phil, he's got a gun! - No shit he's got a gun! - I gotta call you back. Bye. - Come on. - Fuck! Shit. - He shot me! - He shot Eddie! - Fuck this shit! Fuck! Fuck! Go, go, go! Fuck. Okay. Oh, that was some sick shit! Who were those guys? We're gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. What the fuck is going on?! I have no idea. Why don't you just let that go to voicemail? Ha-ha-ha. That's a fake laugh, by the way. It's got, uh, Ted Danson and Magnum P.I. and that Jewish actor. Shut up, Alan. - What room was it again? - It's 825. I know, I did. I already checked with her. I found him, I'll call you back. Thank God, he's with his father. I was freaking out. I missed you, sweetie. And I miss you. No. What the hell happened to you guys? Actually, we were hoping you could tell us. What do you mean? I got up this morning, I went to get coffee... ...and I came back and you were gone. - Why are you being so quiet? - I'm not being quiet. Ha, ha. You're so cute. Yeah, I gotta feed Tyler. Come inside, you guys. Did you hear that? Baby's name is Tyler. Yeah. I thought he looked more like a Carlos too, bud. Okay, what's up? You guys are acting weird. - Look, it's Jade, right? - Very funny, Phil. Right, Jade, uh, ahem, you remember our friend, Doug. Are you kidding? He was the best man. Exactly. Well, we can't find him, and we're getting worried. Oh, my God, that is so Doug. Ha, ha. Oh. Oh, sweetie, I'm... I'm gonna go clean him off. It's all right, Daddy didn't mean it. Oh, my God. What the fuck, man, you gotta hold it together. - Holy shit. - She is super hot. - You should be proud of yourself. - She's wearing my grandmother's ring! - What? - The ring I'm gonna give to Melissa. You remember, my grandmother's Holocaust ring? - Fuck. Okay. - She's wearing it. I didn't know they gave out rings at the Holocaust. - He's okay. - Oh, good. - He was just hungry, he's fine. - Oh, good. About last night, uh, ahem, do you remember the last time you saw Doug? Uh, I haven't seen him since the wedding. The wedding. Okay. Great. And, uh, we can't re... What time was that at? Well, it was, um... I guess it was around 1, because I had to go back to work and finish my shift. And then when I got out I headed over to the hotel with Tyler. And was Doug there then? I didn't see Doug because you guys were passed out. The room was a wreck. - So I just curled up next to Stu. - Uh-huh. - Rowr. - Oh. I got a question. Um, you said when your shift ended. Does that mean you're a nurse? Or a blackjack dealer? - You know this. I'm a stripper. - Mm-hm. Well, technically I'm an escort... ...but stripping's a great way to meet the clients. - Smart. - Savvy. But that's all in the past, now that I married a doctor. I'm just a dentist. - Las Vegas Police! Freeze! - Okay. Shut that baby up! Shut that baby up! - Oh, God! - Okay, okay, okay. After we take the mug shots, we bring them down here... ...where they wait to be interviewed by the arresting officers. Trust me, kids, you do not wanna be sitting on these benches. We call this place Loserville. Follow me. All right, let's do it. Come on. Hello. - Hey, Tracy! It's Phil. - Hey, Phil. - Where are you guys? - We are at the spa at the hotel. Cool. We're just getting some sun. Is Doug around? Of course. Why wouldn't he be? I'm just wondering why you're calling me. Um... We made a deal, no talking to girlfriends or wives. So we're all calling each other's. Okay. What's up? Uh, you are not gonna believe this. We got comped an extra night at the hotel. You did? Yeah. The suite is... It's ridiculous. It's out of control. There's, like, room service and a butler. I mean, just the works. We're thinking of spending the night... ...and we're gonna come back in the morning. You wanna stay an extra night? But the wedding's tomorrow. That's why we're gonna get up early, and we'll be back in plenty of time. Okay. Are you sure that's a good idea? Wenneck, Price, Garner. Room 3. Okay, Trace, I gotta go. We'll talk to you later. Uh... - Come on, chop-chop. - Okay, spin around. - That's it. - Goddamn it. - Wait a second. - I'll go over. I'll go over. - Stop pulling. - Can you just...? Hold on. We got it. Alan, just relax. And then just... There we go. Good. Gentlemen. We've got some good news, and we've got some bad news. The good news is we found your Mercedes. - That's great news. - That's great. See? Yeah, it's over at impound right now. We picked it up at 5 a.m. this morning... ...parked in the middle of Las Vegas Boulevard. - In the middle. That's weird. - Yeah, that is weird. There was also a note. It says, uh, ""Couldn't find a meter, but here's 4 bucks."" The bad news is... ...we can't get you in front of a judge until Monday morning. Oh, no, uh, officer, that's just impossible. No, we need to be in L.A. tomorrow for a wedding. You stole a police car. We didn't steal anything. Um, we found it. Yeah, if anything, we deserve a reward or something, like a trophy. - I see assholes like you every day. - Every fucking day. ""Let's go to Vegas, we'll all get drunk and laid! - Yeah. Whoo! Woo-hoo. - Woo-hoo. Let's steal a cop car, because it'd be really fucking funny."" Think you gonna get away with it? Not up in here. - Not up in here! - Oh. Uh... Sir... ...if I may, um... ...I'm assuming that that squad car belongs to one of you. - Yeah. - Yeah. Look, I'm not a cop. I'm no hero. I'm a schoolteacher. But if one of my kids went missing on a field trip... ...that would look really bad on me. - What are you getting at? - Yeah, Phil, what are you getting at? No one wants to look bad. We gotta get to a wedding... ...and you guys don't need people talking about... ...how some obnoxious tourists borrowed your squad car last night. But look, the point is, I think we can work out a deal. Discreetly of course, ma'am. What do you say? Let me ask you a question: Do, uh, any of you gentlemen have a heart condition or anything like that? Uh, no. Okay, kids, you're in for a real treat today. These gentlemen have kindly volunteered to demonstrate... ...how a stun gun is used to subdue a suspect. Ooh! - That's right. - Wait a sec. What? Now, there's two ways to use a stun gun. Up close and personal. - What the fuck? - Or you can shoot it from a distance. Do I have any volunteers? You wanna come up here and do some shooting? Huh? All right, how about you, young lady? Come on up here. All right. Let's go, handsome, come on. Not you, fat Jesus, slide it on back. You, pretty boy. Fat Jesus. All right, now, it's real simple. All you gotta do is point, aim and shoot. All right? Okay, look. You don't really wanna do this. You can do this. Just focus. Don't listen to this maniac. Let's think this through. Finish him! - Oh, fuck. - Yeah! Right in the nuts! That was beautiful. - Well done. Give her a hand, everybody. - Good job. Good job. Good job. Well done. Good job. That was great. Good. Hey, we got one more charge left. Anybody wanna do some shooting up here? How about you, big man? Come on up here. Okay, same instructions. Just point, aim and shoot. There you go. That's the stuff. I like the intensity. Eye of the tiger. Good. You're holding 50,000 volts, little man. Don't be afraid to ride the lightning. In the face! In the face! Oh, he's still up. He's still up. - Aah! - No. All right, everybody relax, take it easy. We've seen it before. He just needs a little extra charge. There we go. Some of these big boys, you gotta give them two shots. All right, kids, who wants to get their fingerprints done, huh? Come on, let's go. Fuck those guys, you hear me? That was bullshit. I'm telling everybody we stole a cop car. - They let us go, who cares? - I care! You can't just do that. You can't just tase people because you think it's funny. That's police brutality. I'm getting a soda. Do you guys want anything? No. My man doesn't shut up. Jesus Christ. Alan, you okay? I'm just worried. What if something happened to Doug? Something bad. Come on, you can't think like that. I mean, what if he's dead? I can't afford to lose anybody close to me again. It hurts too much. - I was so upset when my grandpa died. - Oh, I'm s... How'd he die? - World War II. - Died in battle? No, he was skiing in Vermont. It was just during World War II. Alan... ...Doug is fine. - Well, why hasn't he called? I don't know, but we're gonna figure it out. I'll tell you another thing, 6-1 odds our car is beat to shit. Stu, not now. No, how much do you wanna bet it's fucked beyond recognition? That's enough. Alan's seriously worried, okay? Let's not freak him out any more. Sorry, Alan. You know what? We'll search the car for clues and everything's gonna be okay. Oh, shit. I can't watch. Just tell me what it looks like. Not looking. Not looking. - Wow. All right. - Oh, thank God. You see? It's gonna be all right. - Anything? - Hmm, I got a cigar. Oh, I found, uh... These are some black shoes. - They women's shoes? - I don't know. - Whose are those? - I don't know. It's a men's size 6. - That's weird. - What is this, a snakeskin? Oh, come on! Ew! - That's a used condom, Alan. - Oh, God. Blech! - Get it out of the car. - Gross, it's wet. - I don't want the thing. - Hey! Come on. I got jizz on me. Jesus Christ, guys! - Get it out. - Fuck! Oh, my God. All right, what the fuck, man? We gotta get this shit together, guys! What was that? It's in the trunk. - Doug's in the trunk. - Oh, fuck! Holy shit! Holy shit! - Open it! Open it! Open it! - Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Oh God! Please! Please! Please stop! Whoa. I'm with you, I'm with you! - You gonna fuck on me? - Nobody's gonna fuck on you! We're on your side. I hate Godzilla! I hate him too. I hate him! He destroys cities! Please! This isn't your fault. I'll get you some pants. What the fuck was that? I have internal bleeding. Somebody call 911. That was some fucked up shit. Who was that guy? He was so mean. Guys, there's something I need to tell you. Last night on the roof, before we went out... ...I slipped something in our Jgermeister. - What? - I'm sorry, I fudged up, guys. - You drugged us? - No, I didn't drug you. I was told it was ecstasy. Well, who told you it was ecstasy? The guy I bought it from at the liquor store. Why would you give us ecstasy? I wanted everybody to have a good time and I knew you guys wouldn't take it. It was just one hit each. I used to do three hits a night. But it wasn't ecstasy, Alan, it was roofies! You think I knew that, Stu? The guy I bought it from seemed like a real straight shooter. You mean the drug dealer at the liquor store wasn't a good guy? Let's just calm down. You fucking calm down! He drugged us. I lost a tooth. I married a whore. - How dare you! She's a nice lady. - You are such a fucking moron. - Your language is offensive. - Fuck you! All right, let's just take a deep breath, okay? Seriously, this is a good thing. At least it's not some stranger who drugged us for God knows what reason. Yeah, you're right, Phil, it's totally a good thing. We're so much better off now. Here's something I would like to remind you two of: Our best friend Doug is probably facedown in a ditch right now... ...with a meth-head butt-fucking his corpse. - That's highly unlikely. - It's true. Does not help. All right, let's get our shit together, guys. Let's go back to the hotel, and I'm gonna make a couple calls. Maybe Doug's back there. Maybe he's asleep. Come on. Let's go. - Stu? Little help? - Shut up. - Ow. - Oh, God. Oh, God, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Alan, I'm sorry. Wait, guys. Guys. What about the tiger? What if he got out? Oh, fuck. I keep forgetting about the goddamn tiger. How the fuck did he get in there? I don't know, because I don't remember. Shh. Stu. Stu, keep it down. Because one of the, uh, side effects of, uh, roofies is memory loss. You are literally too stupid to insult. - Thank you. - Hey. Hey, come on. Did we leave the music on? Hey. Shh. Don't make any sudden movements. - Unh. Whoa! - Aah! - Who the hell are you? - No, who are you? Quiet, quiet. Mike Tyson? Shh. This is my favorite part coming up right now. Need a chorus line, guys. One more time, guys. Oh, Jesus! Oh, fuck! Why did you do that? Mr. Tyson would like to know why is his tiger in your bathroom. Hold on, that was completely unnecessary. I'm a huge fan. When you knocked out Holmes, that was... Explain. All right, look, we were drugged last night. We have no memory of what happened. It's true. We got in all kinds of trouble last night and now we can't find our friend. If you wanna kill us, go ahead because I don't care anymore. - What are you talking about? - I don't care. Why the fuck would you wanna steal his tiger? We tend to do dumb shit when we're fucked up. - I don't believe these guys, man. - Wait, how did you guys find us? One of you dropped your jacket. Found it in the tigers' cage this morning. That's Doug's. Yeah, Doug. His wallet and his room key is in there. - No, that's our missing friend. - I don't give a fuck. - Did you guys see him? - I was fast asleep. Because if he was up, this wouldn't have gone down so smoothly. Maybe one of the tigers ate his ass like Omar. Respect. Wha...? What happened to Omar? Oh, don't worry about Omar, he's not with us no more. Okay, I know this is asking a lot... ...but do you think we could go to your house and look around... ...see if there's any clues? Absolutely. How else you think we're gonna get the tiger back anyway? - Come on, champ. - I'm sorry? We're not gonna put it in the Bentley. You brought it here, you bring it back. What you think, about 40 minutes? Don't make me come back for him. - That was Mike Tyson. - Yeah, no shit that was Mike Tyson. I'm just saying, he's still got it. Alan. Bud, are you okay? - Oh, my God. - Shit! Fuck, where'd he get him? Hey. This does not seem fair. It's Rock, Paper, Scissors. There's nothing more fair. - Alan should do it. - Alan took a punch from Mike Tyson. Come on. For Doug. Why are you peppering the steak? You don't know if tigers like pepper. Tigers love pepper. They hate cinnamon. Phil, just do it. You should do it. I would, but you lost. It wouldn't be right. Okay, I jammed five roofies in there. Just go in there and throw it in to him. Fine. Make sure he eats the whole thing. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Hey, kitty. Hey, sweetie, it's okay. I got a little snack for you. Real important that you eat this, okay? Yeah, just have a little... Shit! What do we do now? We wait. What do tigers dream of When they take a little tiger snooze? Do they dream of mauling zebras Or Halle Berry in her Catwoman suit? Don 't you worry your pretty striped head We're gonna get you back to Tyson And your cozy tiger bed And then we're gonna find Our best friend Doug And then we're gonna give him A best-friend hug Doug Doug Doug, Dougie, Dougie, Doug, Doug But if he's been murdered By crystal-meth tweakers Well, then we're shit out of luck By the way, we're all gonna die. Wait. - Oh, God. - Watch it! His nose. That's his nose. Hey, guys, when's the next Halley's comet? - Who cares, man? - Do you know, Stu? I don't think it's for, like, another 60 years or something. - But it's not tonight, right? - No, I don't think so. But you don't know for sure? No. I got this cousin who saw one. He said it blew his mind. I wanna make sure I never, ever miss out on a Halley's Comet. So if you guys know if there's gonna be one... Oh, fuck! - Oh, my God! - Fuck it! Stu! Stu, it got me! Stu! You got clawed! You're bleeding! - Oh. - I'm panicking. - Aah! - Oh, my God. Okay. Okay, okay. Wait, hold on. I can't do it. Get your fucking hand back in there... ...and steer the car. - I'm too nervous. Alan. We need you, buddy. This is your time to shine, okay? Okay, yeah. Whew. Daddy's gonna kill me. - That's it. - That's good. Keep it straight. - You're late. - Whatever, man. We had to push it the last mile. Come on in. Mike's got something he wants to show you. That thing's out of control, man. Seriously, you gotta put it down. When we got back, we took a look at the security cameras. Great. This is how you walk. This is how you walk. - Oh, it's Doug. - Oh, thank God he's alive. That's our buddy. That's who we've been missing. We're all best friends. Why don't you just pay attention? I don't have all night. Yeah, of course. Of course. What are you doing? Hey, guys. Check it out. Watch this. That's me, I'm on TV. I've never been on TV before. What are you doing, man? Really? Really, Alan? You got a fire hose, man? Yeah, I was, uh... You're gonna overflow the pool, man. - Maybe... Should I wait outside? - I think that's a good idea, Alan. Yeah. Don't touch anything out there, either. You know what? He's not our good fr... We don't know him that well. Come on. Come on, come on. By the way, where you get that cop car from? We, uh, stole it from these dumb-ass cops. Nice. High five that one. Yeah, that's nice. You know, I just have to say... ...I have never seen a more beautiful, elegant, just regal creature. Check it out. Stu. Stu. Fuck this tiger. - Oh, my God. That's awful. - Oh, man. - Oh, shit. - Who does shit like that, man? Someone who has a lot of issues, obviously. I'm a sick man. Oh, my God. That's all we got. This was hugely helpful. Really. Because now we know that our buddy Doug... ...was with us at 3:30, totally alive. Thanks again, champ. And, uh, again, we are so sorry we stole your tiger. Don't worry about it, man. Like you said, we all do dumb shit when we're fucked up. - I told you he'd get it. - I did say that. You know, everyone says Mike Tyson is such a badass... ...but I think he's kind of a sweetheart. I think he's mean. All right. I think it's officially time we call Tracy. Hallelujah. Finally, Phil says something that makes sense. We don't have much of a choice. And maybe she's heard from Doug. That's what I been saying this whole time. We just need to be completely honest. We need to tell her everything. We don't have to tell her everything. We can leave out the stuff... ...about me marrying a hooker. Just stay focused on Doug. - What am I gonna tell my dad? - Alan, relax. It's just the inside. Come on. I got a guy in L.A. who's great with interiors. - Oh, Jesus! - Oh, my God. - Are you guys okay? - What the fuck? I know that guy. That's the guy from the trunk. Get out of the car. Please. W... W... Wait. Those are the guys that shot Eddie. - Listen... - Let's go! - Okay. - Oh, no. - Easy, easy. - Come on. Okay. All right. - All right, all right. - Let's go. Hey, relax. Ow. Ow. Ow! - I have whiplash. - Get this other fat boy. Get the fat boy. Hey, hey, hey. - All right, all right. - Hey, take it easy, take it easy! I want my purse back, assholes. - What? Your purse? - That's not a purse, it's a satchel. It's a purse. Okay? And you steal from wrong guy. Wait a second, wait a second. We stole from you? Okay, you know what? We don't remember anything that happened last night... ...so help us out a little here. Well, apparently you guys met at a craps table late last night. You were on a heater, and he played your hot streak. He ended up winning just under 80 grand. No shit? Eighty grand is nice. Okay, that's good. He put the chips in his purse, and then you guys took off with it. That doesn't sound like us. Mine had $80,000 inside. And this one? Nothing. Hey, there are Skittles in there. Ow! Oh, not again. Don't let the beard fool you. He's a child. It's funny because he's fat. Now, look, this was obviously a very simple misunderstanding. Alan picked up the wrong purse, it's no big deal. Okay, if it's, ""No big deal,"" why, when I come after you guys... ...he starts screaming like crazy and throw me in trunk? What, I did that? Yeah, you said he was your lucky charm... ...and you want to take him home with you. - Lucky charm. - Oh, it's just funny. Fuck you. If you want to see your friend again, you get me my 80 grand. - What? - Our friend? - You have Doug? - You know about our friend? - Doug! - Doug! - Doug's in the car! Doug's in the car! - Doug, it's okay! You chill out, goatee! - Okay, okay. All right, fine, fine. - What do you want? Not so good now. Quid pro quo, douche bag. What? Look, we're very sorry. But this is an easy fix. - Alan, where's his purse? - I don't know. - It's in the hotel room, right? - Yeah, we can get it. We can get you the... We can even write you a check right now. No chance. Cash only. - There's a person in there. - Boring. Take nap. Come on. Wait. I'm sorry we're boring you! - Doug, it's okay. - You kidnapped our friend! Kidnapper! Wait. Oh, no. You're not going anywhere. Stop. Stop. Run me over. - Okay. Whoa. Whoa. - Stu, Stu, Stu. Bring money to Big Rock in Mojave Desert at dawn. - What? - Toodle-oo, motherfucker. Well, at least take the bag off his head! Fuck! Oh! Come on, get out of here. Guys, I'm telling you, I looked for it this morning before we left. It's not anywhere. Fuck. Stu, how much you got in the bank? About 10 grand. I was gonna use it for the wedding. You're already married, so we're good there. Besides, enough with Melissa, she's the worst. Yeah, Doug told me she had sex with a pilot or something. It was a bartender on a cruise. What is wrong with you people? - Ew. Alan, did you just eat sofa pizza? - Yes. What are we gonna do? We are so fucked. Hey, guys? - Did you find it? - Nope. But check this out. Change only, 10,000. - Hey, uh, these seats taken? - No, feel free. All right, let's play some blackjack! That's it. Shut up, bitches. Hmm. - I'll stick. - Oh, fuck you! Fuck you! Splitting fives. - Too many. - Yes! I don't even know you, but I'm gonna tell you that's dumb. - Yes! - Oh! Okay, come on. He can't lose. He can't lose. I think the pit boss is watching him. - Oh, my God. - Are you okay? I'm such a klutz. I get so nervous when I gamble. I'm so silly. - It happens. - Whoa. Hold on a beat, okay? - Let's just take it easy. This is my wife. - It's hurting. Make sure... Does it hurt? Does this hurt? - Oh, ow. - You all right? - I don't know. - I don't know either. I don't... I think you're fine. Let's go. - Really? Okay. - Upsy-daisy, there. I'm sorry, she's had a little too much to drink. Thanks, buddy. That's for you. And 100, 200, 300, 400. With all this, that's $82,400. Oh, goddamn it. I don't fucking believe it. Whoo! - Alan, you're the man. - You are too, Phil. We should come back next week, take the whole city down. Oh, I'm free next week. Or we could just focus on getting Doug back, right now. Uh, you know what? Next week's no good, the Jonas Brothers are in town. But any week after that is totally fine. I think it's safe to say that our luck has officially turned around, guys. We are back, baby. We are fucking back. We're back. Classic. We are back, we are back - That's right. We are getting Doug back And we're the three best friends That anybody could have We're the three best friends That anyone could have We're the three best friends That anyone can have And we'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever Leave each other We're the best three friends That anybody could have I mean, the three best friends That anybody could have That's right, the three best friends That anybody can have - Now what? - Give him the signal. - What signal? - Flash your lights. Let him know it's on. - What's on? - The deal. Of course it's on. We just drove 30 miles into the desert. He knows it's on. Phil, just do something. Fine. - Oh, shit. - See? All right, let's go. Funny fat guy fall on face. You okay? All right, we got the money. Eighty grand, cash. Throw it over. Then I give you Doug. Um, I'm sorry. First of all, good morning. And we didn't catch your name last night. Mr. Chow. Leslie Chow. Mr. Chow, it is a pleasure. My name is Stu. And we would very much appreciate an opportunity to see Doug... ...before we give you the money, just to verify that he's okay. - lf that's cool. - Of course, Stu. That is cool. - Oh, thank God. - Okay. See, he fine. Now give me money... ...or I shoot him, and I shoot all you motherfuckers. And then we take it. Your choice, bitches. - Give him the money, Stu. - Okay. - It's all there. - Let him go. All right, take it easy. Take it easy. Ta-da. Is this some kind of joke? Who the hell is this? That is not Doug. What you talking about, Willis? That him. No, I'm sorry, Mr. Chow. That's not our friend. - He... That's... - The Doug we're looking for is a white. Ah! I told you you had the wrong guy, little boy. Damn, Alan, what the fuck you got me into? - You know him? - This is the guy... ...that sold me the bad drugs. - How you doing? - I didn't sell you no fucking bad drugs. - Wait. He sold you the Ruphylin? - Ruphylin? I sold you that Ru...? Wha...? - Who gives a shit? Where is Doug? - I am Doug. - Your name's Doug? - Yes, I'm Doug. His name's Doug too. Ha. Classic mix-up. Come on. Hey, Chow. You gave us the wrong Doug. Not my problem. No, fuck that shit. Now, you give us our 80 grand back and take him with you! - No. Come on. I'll be your Doug. - Oh, yeah, okay. Oh, I take him back. Right after you suck on these little Chinese nuts. - Ah. That's nasty. - Mmm. How that sound? Unh, pshh. - So long, gay boys. - Wait a second. He's a nasty little motherfucker. Did you ever get any ecstasy? No, I ain't got no fucking ecstasy. - Goddamn it! - Gosh darn it! - Shit! - Shoot! - Hello? - Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil. Phil, where the hell are you guys? I'm freaking out. Yeah, listen. We fucked up. Thanks for the lift back to town. - I got a question for you. - What's up? How did you wind up in Chow's car? That crazy asshole kidnapped me yesterday. Okay, but why? I mean, why you? He thought I was with you guys because we were hanging over at the Bellagio. - What? - We were at the Bellagio? We were shooting craps. You don't remember? No. No, we don't remember. Because some dick drug dealer sold him Ruphylin and told him it was ecstasy. Ruphylin. There you go with that word. Ruphylin. What the hell is a Ruphylin? Wow, you are the world's shittiest drug dealer. Ruphylin, for your information, is the date rape drug. You sold Alan roofies. Oh, shit. I must have mixed up the bags. My fault, Alan. Damn, Marshall gonna be pissed off at me on that one. - Whatever. - It's funny, because just the other day... ...me and my boy, we was wondering why they even call them roofies. - You know what I'm talking about? - No. Don't know. Why not floories, right? Because when you take them... ...you're more likely to end up on the floor than the roof. What about groundies? That's a good new name for them. Or, how about rapies? - Wait, what did you just say? - Rapies. Not you. Doug, what did you say before? I said groundies. No, before that. You said, ""You're more likely to wind up on the floor than..."" - Phil. - Listen, Trace, I'm really sorry. l... - Phil? Hello? - Tracy, it's Stu. Stu. Talk to me. What's going on? Uh, nothing. Don't listen to Phil. He's completely out of his mind. He's probably still drunk from last night. Where's Doug? He is paying the bill. We just had a delicious brunch. We're in a hurry to get back, so we gotta get going. - Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye. - Stu. Stu. Fuck. - What the fuck, man? - I know where Doug is. I don't know, man. It just hit me. You remember when we saw Doug's mattress impaled on that statue? - Yeah, we threw it out the window. - No, impossible. You can't open windows in Vegas hotels. Well, then how did it get...? - Oh, my God! - Ha, ha, ha. - Whoa, wait. What's going on? - Doug was trying to signal someone. - Holy shit. - Yes. - Wait. How did you figure that out? - Doug made me realize it. - Doug? - Uh, not our Doug. Black Doug. - Hey, hey, easy with that shit. Come on. - Sorry. Can someone tell me where white Doug is? - He's on the roof, Alan. - Yes. He's on the roof. We must have taken him up there as a prank... ...so he'd wake up on the roof. - Like that time in summer camp. We moved his sleeping bag out in the jetty at the lake? Ha, ha, ha. Which was hilarious. It's not so funny now, though, because we forgot where we put him. You guys are retarded, you know that? - Holy shit. You think he's still up there? - There's only one way to find out. Doug! Doug! - Doug! - Doug, you up here, buddy? Where you at, Doug? Doug! Hey, guys! He's over here! - Hey, I found him! He's over here! - Oh, shit. He's okay. You're okay. Ha, ha, ha! Oh, God. We gotta go, buddy. Come on. Oh, we have been looking everywhere for you. - He's alive. - What the fuck is going on? We can explain everything, but right now we gotta go. - Hey, bud. You okay? - No. Not okay. You look good, you got some color. I'm jealous. - I'm getting married today. - Yes, you are. That's why you need to focus and do everything we say. Because, frankly, you're wasting a little bit of time right now. You fucking asshole! Oh, my skin burns. My skin burns. Oh, ow! God. - It's okay. It's not your fault, Doug. - Don't touch me. Shut up. All of you, shut up. Just get me home. Mm-hm. Just get me home. What about the one after that? You cannot be serious. Oh, goddamn it. - What? - Every flight to L.A. is booked. - What about Burbank? - Sold out. Oh, fuck! We can't drive there, the wedding starts in three and a half hours. - Alan, where's the car? - It's on its way. You know what? We can drive there. We can make it. Okay? Hi. - Just give me one second. - We will leave without you. - Is he missing a tooth? - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. Hey, thanks for helping out last night. That was so awesome. Sure. Listen, Jade, l... Look, you don't have to say it. I totally understand. - This whole thing was stupid. - Huh. It was stupid, wasn't it? - This is yours. - Oh, thank you. I can't believe I gave my grandmother's Holocaust ring to someone I just met. - What was I thinking? - You were really fucked up. Clearly. - You did pull out your own tooth. - l...? I pulled out my tooth? Why did I pull out my own tooth? Alan bet you that you weren't a good enough dentist... ...to pull out your own tooth. Okay. Heh. - Of course he did. - You won. Yeah. Clearly. Yeah. That's victory, right there. It needs to go down. - It's good. Get in. - No. Safety first. - Alan, it's fine. It's down. - No, I gotta get it down first. - Jesus Christ. Look out. - Don't mess the car up. You're gonna mess the car up. - Hey, what are you doing next weekend? - I don't know. Working. Why? I was thinking maybe I'd come back and take you out to dinner. Really? Like a date? Yeah. Like a date. Only, one that hopefully I'll remember. Sounds good. - Stu. Come on. - Stu. Come on. I gotta go. Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. All right, here we go. - All right, let's go. - Yeah. Careful. At least the trip wasn't a total disaster. - What makes you say that? - When I woke up on the roof... ...I happened to find $80,000 worth of Bellagio chips in my pocket. - Oh! - Oh, my God! Looks like we're going home with some money, boys. Here he comes. That's him. - Hey, Neeco! - Hey. What's up, Alan? Whoo! - Whoa, look out. - Oh, shit. Whoa! Whoa! - Thanks, Neeco. - You got it, man. - Page me! - Adis. - Who the hell was that guy? - That's my buddy. Hey. Sorry, MapQuest took us on a really crazy route. - How's my hair? - It looks good. - Is it cool like Phil's? - It's classic Phil. She looks beautiful, man. Sorry I'm late. Vegas. Where were you? And why are you so red? Honey, it's a long story. We are gathered here today... ...because of the strength of love and of promises kept. All I know is I am so sorry. And I promise for as long as we're married... ...to never, ever put you through anything like this again. Can you forgive me? - Daddy. - Hey, my man. Excuse me, but I'm expecting my husband any minute. Oh, that's very funny. Come here. How was your soccer game? - Stu? You avoiding me? - Hey. Melissa. Oh, my God. What happened to your tooth? Have you met Alan? Tracy's brother. Brother of the... Okay. Ow. That is disgusting. Why haven't you returned my calls? Well, there was a snafu when we stopped... I called that bed and breakfast in Napa. They said they had no record of you even checking in. That's because we didn't go to Napa. - Stu. What the fuck is going on? - We went to Las Vegas. Oh, really? Las Vegas? Why would you go to Las Vegas? My friend was getting married. That's what guys do. - Okay, that's not what you do. - Really? Well, then why did I do it, huh? Because I did it. Riddle me that. Why'd I do it? All you want me to do is what you want me to do. I'm sick of doing what you want. In a healthy relationship, a guy should be able to do what he wants. - That is not how this works! - Oh, good. Because whatever this is ain't working for me! - Oh, really? - Yeah. Since when? Since you fucked that waiter on your cruise last June. Boom! - You told me it was a bartender. - Oh, you're right. I stand corrected. It was a bartender. You fucked a bartender. You're an idiot. You're... You... You're such a bad person. Like, all the way through to your core. Alan, shall we dance? Let's do this. - It was a real pleasure meeting you. - Fuck off. - I'm getting my bartender's license. - Suck my dick. No, thank you. You guys are awesome. Dougie... ...I gotta tell you, man, this was a gorgeous wedding. - I give it six months. - You're a dick. I don't know what to say. Thanks for the bachelor party, I guess? Yeah. I just wish we could actually remember some of it. - Hey, guys? Look what I found. - Whoa, that's my camera. - It was in the back seat of the car. - Oh, Go... Are there photos on it? Yeah. Some of it's even worse than we thought. - No fucking way. Give me that. - Wa... Wa... Wait. Wait, wait, wait. We look at these pictures together, okay? One time. - And then we delete the evidence. - I say we delete it right now. Are you nuts? I wanna find out how I wound up in the hospital. - Yeah, it's in there. - Guys, one time. - Deal? - Deal. - Deal. - Okay. Oh, dear Lord! That's classic!, # Show me a man # Who's gentle and kind # And I'll show you # A loser # Now show me a man # Who takes what he wants # Oh, how exciting # So the poets sing # When you're a fool in love # And nothing goes the way you plan # And no one cares # And no one understands # That you're a fool # And you're in love # Never another spring for you # Never a robin to sing for you # You're out there on your own # When you're a fool in love # When you're a fool in love # Seems like the skies # Are always grey # You turn around, there's someone in your way # And it's you # And you're in love # Sometimes you think that your luck has changed # And a rainbow explodes 'cross the sky # But when you're a fool in love # You'll be a fool till the day you die # I know we haven't been together that long, but these last 10 months have been the happiest of my life. You're not only the person I love, you're also my best friend... and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me? Yes. Seriously, do you think that sounds good? - No! - Really? Cos I think that... No! Oh! Oh! Sorry. Sorry. Sometimes these catheters can pinch a little bit. Well, thanks. I appreciate it. You got a real gentle touch there, Doctor. She won't be able to say no. Actually, I'm a nurse. Doctor'll be right in. - Good luck, Greg. - Thanks, Cameron. OK, it's time for our problem of the week. I want you to pick out your problem, a problem that's been bothering you all week. With your eyes still closed... I want you to picture that problem in your mind. Pretend it's right there in front of you. ...not only my best friend, but you're also the person that I... want to spend the rest of my life with. I love you. Will you... marry me? Now I want you to scare your problems away. - I want you to say ""boo""! - Boo! - BOO! - BOO! All right, you guys are great. Very good. I will see you guys after lunch. Pam, isn't that your special friend? Yeah, I think so. - Why don't you talk to him? - You think I should? Yeah! Come here! - Hi, sweetie. - How're you doing? I was in the area, got off early, thought you'd want to go eat. That's very sweet. What a nice surprise. Oh, shoot! I forgot to change my shoes. That's OK. You know I can't resist a man in nurse's shoes. I got my sneakers here. Let me change. It'll take a second. Huh! OK. Honey? - Pam. - Yeah? - I love you. - I love you, too. Come on, sweetie. I got a half-hour before I have to be back. So you wanna go have lunch? What are you doing? Um, nothing. I just love you so much. These last 10 months... have been the happiest of my life. Yeah, they've been amazing, but... What's going on? Nothing. I just... I just feel like, you know, we're so close. You're my best friend, and you're also the woman that I love, and... You OK, sweetie? You're acting weird. I just got a crick in my neck. I did CPR on a 300-pound crack head today. - Want me to massage your neck? - No, no. Honey, your kids are trying to tell you something! Oh, hold on. Oh, it's my sister. Hello. Hi. You're engaged? Congratulations! You're getting married in two weeks? That's... a little soon. Mom and Dad... really don't know Bob very well. Dad was OK with this? Wow. That was very thoughtful of him. I can't believe he knew to ask Dad's permission. Yeah. I'm just here with Greg. He's taking me to lunch. He's OK. I know you've got to go. All right. I love you. Bye. So, what's going on? Debbie's marrying that guy? Yeah. In two weeks. Dr Bob of Denver. Isn't that great? Yeah, that's... Didn't they just meet a few months ago? Yeah, but he asked her and she said yes. Well, he asked my dad first. Yeah, I overheard that. So he had to ask his permission? No, he didn't have to. Bob just understood that Dad appreciates that. - Mm-hm. - Deb said that Dad loves him. Bob bought him the perfect gift that just won him over. Really. Huh, a gift. Is it OK to X-ray this? Yeah. It won't mutate. - Sir, that's not gonna fit. - Wait a second. It's too big. You got to check it. Raise your arms, sir. Look, I got an engagement ring in the bag, so I can't open it here, can't I just carry it on? If it don't fit through the frame, you ain't carrying it on the plane. 531, New York, La Guardia. Check it. Wait, wait, excuse me... Don't worry, it'll be waiting for you there. 'Welcome to La Guardia Airport. Please follow the signs... ' Excuse me. Hi. You lost my bag and there's a diamond ring inside it. I didn't lose your anything, sir. Put your address here and we'll ship it when it surfaces. And if it doesn't? Am I supposed to go the whole weekend with just these clothes? It's great. I just thought you were getting champagne. Trust me, your dad's gonna love this gift. Well, don't forget he's retired. He was in the rare flower business, he'll be interested. Sounds like they're hard to please. No, not at all. He's the sweetest man in the world. - He's gonna love you. I promise. - As much as he loves Dr Bob? Easy on the sarcasm. Humour is wasted on my parents. What, are they Amish? OK, no jokes. - What are you doing? - What? My dad sees smoking as a sign of weakness. - OK, I'll leave them in the car. - No! He'll check there. - Oh, gosh... - What...?! Yeah, the roof is probably a better idea. Oh, and... we're not living together. - I thought you said you told them. - Well... Hi, Daddy! Hi! - Oh, I missed you so much, Pamcake. - I missed you too, Popjack. Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Shortstack, shortstack, coming up! Where's my widdle girl? Mommy! My mom! Oh, you look so beautiful! So do you! Look at you! Oh, I'm sorry. Mom, Dad, this is Greg. - Hi, I'm Pam's father, Jack Byrnes. - It's great to meet you. - I'm Dina. Welcome to Oyster Bay. - Thanks. What you driving, a Ford? Uh, yeah. It's a Taurus. We were gonna get a mid-size, but I figure, hey, pulling down decent bucks, might as well go all out and pop for the full-size. True. Interesting colour. You pick it? Oh, no, the guy at the counter. Why? Well, they say geniuses pick green. - But you didn't pick it. - Jack! Oh, yucky! What smells of old sour milk? Oh, poor Greg got spit up on by a baby. He didn't! He did, Ma, at Lost Luggage. The airline lost his bag. Oh! They didn't! Yeah, they did. - What about you, honey? - No, I carried on. That's my girl! It'll turn up, I'm sure. And Greg, meanwhile, anything you need, just ask, huh? That's right. Mi casa es su casa. Oh, thanks, Jack. You, too. Yeah, ha ha! Hey, Momma, looks great! Really? We spruced up for the wedding. This is so nice! We like it. Beautiful. Oh, now, Greg, you have a very unique last name. And we were curious, er, how do you pronounce it? Oh. Just like it's spelled. F-O-C-K-E-R. Focker. Hmm... Focker. - I'll get it, honey. - Oh, thanks, Mom. Oh, there he is! Jinxy! Come here, baby! Come to Daddy, Jinxy! Come on, Jinxy! Come here. Come to Daddy. Come on. Oh! Taught him that in one week. This is Pam's cat, Jinxy. - Say hello. Wave to Greg. - Hello, Jinx. Attaboy! That took me another week. - My gosh! - I didn't know you had a cat. I left him here when I moved to Chicago. Your daddy's best friend! You won't believe it, he even taught him to use the potty. Dad, that's kinda weird. Why? Now we don't have to smell kitty litter. That's right. How did you teach the cat to use the toilet? Easy. I designed a litter box to put inside the toilet. Once he got used to it, I took it away. Oh! That's... Yeah, makes sense. But he doesn't like it. Every chance he gets he tries to squat and bury. I had to move all my plants. Plus you got another guy in the house to leave the seat up. He can't lift the seat. He lacks the strength and opposable thumbs. Ah, right. Opposable... Didn't think about that. Jinx is a house cat. He can't go out. He lacks survival skills. It's just one of those things. I don't think Greg will be playing with Jinxy. He hates cats. Pam, I don't hate cats. I don't... I just happen to be more of a dog lover. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's OK if you hate cats, Greg. I don't. I don't hate cats... at all. That's OK. Just be honest about it. There's some things I hate. I'm being honest, really. Like what? Why don't we let the kids freshen up? Greg, we'll get you something to wear from Jack's closet. OK. - Oh, honey. - Yeah? I'm so happy you're home, sweetheart. Me, too, Daddy. Hey, listen, be nice to this one, OK? I kinda like him. OK, I'll try. Thank you. Shirt fit OK, Greg? Fantastic. Thanks, Jack. Good. Tom Collins coming up. I wish you hadn't said that I hate cats. You do hate cats. But you didn't have to say right when we met. I'm sorry. It just slipped out. Get your red hot pu-pus! My goodness! What is that? Oh, that's just... a little something from me. Go ahead, open it up. Oh, look, honey. Greg brought us a present! Oh, isn't that nice? Look at this. It's a flower pot... with the dirt in it. Actually, the real gift is what's planted in the soil. The bulb of a Jerusalem Tulip. Which, I was told, is one of the rarest and most beautiful flowers in existence. Oh, right, right. Uh, the Jerusalem. From the Jerusalis tulipizius genus, yes, yes. Anyway, the guy said with regular watering it should bloom in six months. Well, we'll look forward to that. So, uh, Greg, how's your job? Um, good, Pam. Thanks for asking. I recently got transferred to triage. Is that better than a nurse? No, Mom, triage is a unit of the ER. That's where all the top nurses work. - Well... - No. They do. Not many men in your profession. No, Jack. Not traditionally. Pam, did you know that your father started his own business? Really? Dad, that's great! Yes, I thought with my experience, why let retirement stop me? I really admire that. So what is it? What's...? What's the new venture? Oh, let me ask you a question, Greg. Let's say you have kids and you wanna get out of the house, you know? So you hire a baby-sitter, someone you think you can trust. References, experience - all check out fine. But, how do you know for certain that your loved ones are safe with this stranger? I mean, can you ever really trust another human being, Greg? Sure. I think so. No. The answer is you cannot. Let me show you something. Take a look at this, Greg. What's this look like to you? It looks like a teddy bear. Smile. You're on nanny camera! I've seen these advertised on TV. Not like this you haven't. Take a look. Oh, my gosh. Hi. Where's the other camera? Right here in this decorative artefact. - That's great. - Our cameras are motion activated. They tape as soon as they sense any movement. We can hide them in mirrors, lamps, you name it. So no matter where you go... we'll be watching you. Couldn't this be construed as illegal? Invasion of privacy? Greg, when you have little Fockers running around, you'll see the need for protection. Yeah. - Impressive, isn't it? - Quite. - I'll get that. - I'll get it. OK. Any problem with the documents? Good. I'll meet you at the Oyster Bay drugstore in about 20 minutes. You gotta be careful if you call here. If I don't answer, use a southern accent and ask for the vegetarian special. And the wedding's on Sunday? Oh, that wasn't the airline, was it? No, wrong number. We're out of Collins, so I'll go to the store. I thought I just bought some. You know how that stuff just goes. Back in a jif. Well, why doesn't Greg go with you? You'll need something in case your suitcase doesn't show up. - I'm sure it'll show up. - Yeah. Don't take a chance. You don't even have a toothbrush. Go on. Yeah. OK, unless you want some privacy. Why would I need privacy? No, I didn't... think you would. OK, let's head out. - Bye. - Have fun, you guys. Pam, he seems wonderful! He is. We have the best time together. Good. - Now, have you two been mm-mm-mm? - Mother! No! Thinking about anything permanent? I don't know. We haven't discussed it, but, I definitely have the feeling this is it. Dad seems to like him, don't you think? Absolutely. It's a big day Saturday. Yes. This car's... You got... What do you use, unleaded, regular unleaded? - Premium. - Uh-huh. Hey, Jack, now that... Now that we have a second to talk, I just want you to know how much Pam means to me. I know we haven't been together that long, but the time that we have spent together has been incredible. Greg, how come you don't like cats? I don't not like cats. I just... I just prefer dogs. I mean, I'm just more of a dog kind of... You know. You come home, they're... wagging their little tails, happy to see you. You need that assurance, do you? You prefer an emotionally shallow animal? I... When you yell at a dog, his tail goes between his legs and covers his genitals, his ears go down. A dog is easy to break. But cats make you work for their affection. They don't sell out like dogs. You like Peter, Paul, and Mary? Yes, I do. I'm a big fan. # Puff, the magic dragon # Lived by the sea... # Great song. Yeah. One of my favourites. Who would've thought it wasn't really about a dragon, huh? What do you mean? You know, the whole drug thing. No, I don't know. Why don't you tell me? Some people, uh... think that... To ""puff the magic dragon"" means... they're really... Erm... To smoke a... smoke... ...a marijuana cigarette. Well, Puff's just the name of the boy's magical dragon. Right. - Are you a pot head, Focker? - No! No. What? No, no, no, Jack. No, I'm... I'm not. I... I pass on grass... all the time. I mean not all the time... - Yes or no? - No. Yes. No. Greg, I'll meet you out front in about... 12 to 15 minutes. OK. Hey. Hi. - Hey. - Hi. Do you have any nicotine patches? No. We have the gum. All right. You chew it. Thank you. And what's your most expensive bottle of champagne? Mumm's. It's on sale for $13.95. That's it? You don't have a nice $80 or $100 bottle or something? You can get a whole bunch of Mumm's. - Focker? - Jack. Ready to go? Rough and ready, yeah. They ran out of Collins mix. You been waiting long? No! I was just reading up about... ...pumps. Pumps? Yes. Breast pumps. I grew up on a farm. Get your hot buns. Hot patooties. Wow, Dina, everything looks fabulous. It's such a treat to have a home-cooked meal like this. Dinner at my house meant fighting over containers of Chinese food. Oh, you poor thing! There wasn't enough food to go around? No, there was. We just never really sat down like a family like this. Greg, would you like to say grace? Uh, well, Greg's Jewish, Dad. You know that. You're telling me the Jews don't pray, honey? Unless you have some objection? No, no, no. I'd love to. Pam, it's not like I'm a rabbi or something. I've said grace at many... a dinner table. OK. Oh... dear God... Thank you. You are such a good God to us. A kind and gentle and... accommodating... God. And we thank you, O, sweet, sweet Lord of Hosts, for the... ...smorgasbord you have so aptly lain at our table this day... and each day... by day... Day by day... by day. O... dear Lord, three things we pray. To love thee more dearly, to see thee more clearly, to... follow thee more nearly, day by day... by day. Amen. Amen. Oh, Greg, that was lovely. Thank you, Greg. That was interesting too. Oh. That's a... that's a lovely vase. It looks great. Let me guess, is that one of your secret cameras too, huh? Greg... That urn holds the remains of Jack's mother. Oh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That... That's all right. You didn't know. I'm... That's our Gran-Gran. We like to think of her as watching over us as we eat. Love you, Ma. Miss you. Miss you every day. Oh, honey, why don't you read Greg your poem? Oh, no. He doesn't want to hear that. What? No, what poem? You see, when Jack had to retire for health reasons... That's a bunch of malarkey. ...the doctor thought it would be therapeutic if he expressed his emotions in an artistic way. You wrote a beautiful poem about your mother. Please, we really want to hear it. - Poem! Poem! - Please? All right. It's a work in progress. I'm still not happy with it. As soon as it's ready, I'm going to glaze it onto a plate and put it next to the urn. Nice. It's very special. My Mother... by Jack Byrnes. You gave me life, you gave me milk, you gave me courage. Your name was Angela, the angel from heaven. But you were also an angel of God, and He needed you, too. Selfishly, I tried to keep you here, while the cancer ate away your organs, like an unstoppable rebel force, but I couldn't save you, and I shall see your face... nevermore, nevermore, nevermore. Until we meet... in Heaven. Daddy, that's beautiful. It just gets me... Amazing. So-so-so much love, yet also so much... information. It takes a lot out of him. Greg, would you like some yams? Thank you. Oh, yeah. You must have had vegetables fresher than that growing up on a farm. Dad, Greg grew up in Detroit. He told me he grew up on a farm. Do they have many farms in Detroit? No, Dina. Not a lot. In fact, Jack, I should clarify this. I didn't actually grow up... on a farm per se. The house that we grew up in was originally erected in the early Dutch farm... colonial style. So, that plus we had a lot of pets... Which one did you milk then? Dad! Honey, he said he'd pumped milk. What have you ever milked? Cat. A cat? I milked a cat once. You wanna hear a story? Sure. My sister had a cat and the cat birthed a litter of kittens. There must have been 30 of them. There was this runt, this sweet little, Little-Engine-That-Could runt who could... Wanted to get up there but couldn't really get access to the... To the... uh... teat. Teat? Dad. What have you. I went in and just simply... You know, just... Into a little saucer. And then took the saucer and fed it to Geppetto. That was his name. Geppetto. I had... I had no idea you could milk a cat. You can milk anything with nipples. I have nipples. Could you milk me? OK, can we change the subject, perhaps? Oh, champagne! I thought we could celebrate with some bubbly. That'd be great. Good idea. ""I have nipples. Can you milk me?"" Well, in a funny way you've already seen Deb's ring. Mm-hm. That's true. Would anybody care for some of Oyster Bay's finest champagne? That is so sweet of you. Isn't that a nice gesture? Yeah, very nice. How could I have seen Debbie's ring? When I gave Bob the OK, I put him in touch with my diamond guy and he picked the exact same design that Kevin gave you. - Kevin your old boyfriend? - Thanks, Dad. Kevin was Pam's fianc. - Oh! - Oh, my God! Jinxy, no! Psst! - Ohh... - Jinxy, no! Shit! Greg, sweetie, how are you doing? Fine, considering I desecrated your grandma's remains, found out you were engaged and had your father ask me to milk him. At least then he was talking to me, so... You didn't say you were that close. - Who, Daddy and me? - No, Kevin and you. Do we have to know everything about each other? I never knew about your cat-milking. That was a long time ago, Pam. OK, well, so was this. Kevin's and my... connection was more... physical than anything else. Physical? Like what, like, you worked out together? No, no, it was nothing. It was... just a stupid sexual thing. I'm gonna go throw up now. Oh, Greg. Kevin and I were only engaged for a month before I realised it was a mistake. L- I gave back the ring, I moved to Chicago and I met and fell in love with you, so can we please drop this? - OK. - Good. I just feel this isn't going well. Your dad hates me. He doesn't hate you, sweetie. Just give him a chance, all right? Maybe he's nervous too, huh? I thought he would love my gift, being this big flower guy, but it's like... he didn't show the slightest bit of interest. Listen to me, forget the gift. You're the most adorable, loving, sweetest man in the world and I love you. And very soon my parents are gonna see that and grow to love you too, OK? OK? Speaking of growing to love you... - It's late. - I know it's late. But Mr Winkie is still on Chicago time and we both know there's only one way to make Mr Winkie go away, right? And there it is. What's with the robe? It's Pam's. My pyjamas are in the suitcase. Hey, I'll lend you a pair of Jack's. - OK, honey? - Sure. You don't have to do that. - No, no. - No, we have to. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I just want to say don't worry about what happened. Oh. Well, thanks, Jack. I still... I feel horrible, I mean... Well, it was a horrible thing. But let's put all that behind us and enjoy our weekend together. OK. Thank you, Daddy. Chug-chug-chug... Thank you. These'll do just fine. Good night. Night. Why'd you give him my favourite pair? Night, see you in the morning, right? - Have a good sleep. - You too. Oh, no, no, Greg, we made up the pullout for you down in the den. Oh. OK, cos Pam said I should sleep in Debbie's room, but... Debbie's sleeping here tomorrow so you'll have more privacy, your own bathroom. Just try not to flush the toilet. It's a little quirky. OK. Oh, one more thing. Look, I understand you've probably had premarital relations with my Pam, but under our roof, it's my way or the Long Island Expressway, is that understood? Of course. Yeah. Good. Keep your snake in its cage for 72 hours. OK. 'Welcome to Atlantic American Airways. 'Customer satisfaction always comes first. 'We have heavy call logging. 'As your call is important to us it will be answered in 27 minutes. 'Press 1 to talk to a representative. ' 'We are closed. Please call back. ' Sorry. There's just something about him that's a little off. Yeah, yeah. Jack. We've been through this with every boyfriend since, what, middle school? I think Greg is a lovely young man. And honey, Pam thinks he might be the one. She said that? She said those exact words? Well, I didn't tape record her, Jack, but that's the impression I got. I feel sorry that boy never had... What kind of a family doesn't sit down for dinner? Fugitives. Try to enjoy the weekend, honey. - Both our daughters are in love. - That's what I'm worried about. Oh... Oh, jeez. I just realised something. - What? - Pam's middle name. Martha... Oh, no. Pamela Martha Focker. ""Operation Ko Samui""? Looking for something, Greg? Oh. Jesus, Jack, you scared me. Well, I heard a noise so I came to see if everything was OK. I just... I'm sorry, I saw a light on in here and I kinda stumbled in... That's OK. See anything interesting? No. Not at all. I mean... I mean, this is great, though. I love this... What you... It's a cosy little nook. I noticed you were looking at that. Yeah. It's an antique polygraph machine. Is that what that is? I've seen these before but never up close. You know what? Why don't you try that on? Oh... that's OK. We'll have some fun! I'll show you how it works. - I shouldn't. - Why? You've nothing to hide. - No. I know. - So there's no problem. - No, there's no problem. - So try it on. - OK. - I'll help you. Don't worry, you'll enjoy this. All right. Looks complicated. Now, these aren't 100% accurate, right? You'd be surprised how accurate they are. They can tell if someone's lying. Now I'm gonna ask you some questions. All you have to do is answer yes or no. OK. All right, let's give it a whirl. - Did you fly on an aeroplane today? - Yes, I did. No peeking. Did we eat pot roast for dinner tonight? Yes. Was it undercooked? N- n-no, it was rare. It was a little rare for my taste, but I... I wouldn't... I'm just kidding. I'm just... OK. Relax, relax. The needles are jumping. Have you ever watched pornographic videos? No. - I mean, well, I don't... - Yes or no? Hey. Hey. What's the matter, you can't sleep? No, I'm just going over my answers from the polygraph test your dad gave me. - Oh, no, he didn't? - Yeah, he did. Well, did you lie to him? No! I mean... Well, he asked me if we were living together, I... What did you tell him? Nothing. Your mother walked in and I yanked the thingies off. Would you react like this if he shoved bamboo shoots up my nails? Or does he hook all your boyfriends up to his little machine? He doesn't need a machine. He's a human lie detector. What? My father was never in the rare flower business. That was just his cover. He was in the CIA for 34 years. How could you not tell me this? I wanted to, honey, but it was strictly on a ""need-to-know"" basis. So, what, he's in the CIA? He was a spy? He is a spy...? No, he was a psychological profiler. He interrogated double agents in the company. Oh, that's great. I was scared of your dad when he was a florist. It's wonderful to know I've got a CIA spy hunter on my ass. Would you stop? You're doing great, OK? This is a lot to take in, honey. I'm sorry. It's just weird. I know, but you're doing fine. I promise. - No! - What's wrong, sweetie? I forgot. I'm not supposed to let the snake out. You what? I told your dad I wouldn't touch you. Well, I'm not in junior high any more, OK? No, seriously. I wanna try to respect his rules, OK? OK. Fine. You go ahead and get some sleep and I'll see you in the morning. OK. Morning, Greg. Morning. Pam told me she let you in on a little secret of mine last night. Yes, she did. As long as you keep your mouth shut for the rest of your life, you're in no immediate danger. I won't tell. I'm just being humorous. Ha. That's funny. The fact is, Greg, with the knowledge you've been given you are now on the inside of what I like to call the Byrnes Family Circle of Trust. I keep nothing from you, you keep nothing from me and round and round we go. OK. Understood. OK, good. Come on, let's go inside and have breakfast. # Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat, where are you? # I love you # Jinxy. Not at the table, honey, please. Attaboy! Hey, hey, look who's up! You must be Greg. Hello. Somebody had a little visit from the hair fairy. Oh, yes. Nice do. Nice do. I'll do the intros. This is my sister Debbie. - The bride to be. Congratulations. - Hi. - And her fianc Dr Bob. - Oh, call me Bob... MD. And his parents, Linda Banks. Hi, how are you? And the world famous plastic surgeon Dr Larry. Oh, now, cut that out! - Greg's in medicine too, Larry. - Oh, really? What field? Uh, nursing. - That's good. - No, really, what field? Nursing. Why don't I get you a chair, Greg? Thank you. Thanks. So, you didn't want to go for the MD? No, I thought about it but I decided it wasn't for me. Just as well, Board's a killer. Actually Greg aced his MCATs. - You serious? - No, I did OK. Oh, he did more than OK, trust me. Why did you take the test? I wanted to keep my options open. Nursing was just better for me. You can work in several different areas. I can focus 100% on patient care. Doctors have bureaucracy... Uh-oh! Wasn't your friend Andy supposed to be here by now? Oh, I thought Deb told you, Dr Andy can't make the wedding. Damn! Now I have to reconfigure the whole procession. Um... Bob, why doesn't Greg stand in for Andy, be the usher? Oh... No, Pam. No. That'll be fine. Bob, Greg will be your second usher. Uh... Yeah, yeah. OK, sure. Good. Well, let's all finish up and get ready to go. We have a pre-activity briefing in about 32 minutes. Really! In that case, I'd better get upstairs and pay a visit to the shower fairy. Dina, thank you so... Hey, you OK? Why didn't you wake me up? - I thought you'd like to sleep late. - Not when I'm a guest. It's OK. No, it's not OK. Tell that to Dr Torquemada and his Inquisition. Go take a shower, get dressed and come down. - In what? - Borrow some of Dad's clothes. - No, I don't... Come on! - Why not? I don't feel comfortable wearing your dad's underwear. OK, go wake up Denny and borrow some of his. Wake up your brother, who I never met, to borrow his clothes? OK. All right. Where's Denny's room? Top of the stairs, turn right. Denny? Denny? Denny? Hello? Hey, hey! What the hell are you doing here? I'm... I'm Greg, Pam's friend. Were you sniffing my boxers, dude? No! Dude, no. She said I could come up and borrow some clothes from you. - No, no. Close the door... quick. - OK. - You tell anybody I wasn't here? - No. They think you're asleep, so, it's all good. You scared me. Your dad keeps you guys under a close watch, huh? No, it's not that bad. Your little Pamcake's got it a lot worse than I do. Oh! You need some clothes. Yes, that would be great, thanks. Hey, glad to hook you up. All right. Like what you've done with the crib. Oh, Lil' Kim. She's phat. P-H phat. These ought to do it. Here you go, chief. - All right! - Enjoy. - Thanks a lot. - No problem. Oh, don't worry about the little covert op, all right? - Keep it on the low down. - Down low. No doubt. Come get your revised itineraries! - Larry and Linda. - Got it. Bob. Honey. I'm gonna activate the alarm. It'll go off in T minus 16 seconds. - I don't need a jacket. - It's cold out. Hold on. Here, take Denny's jacket. Denny, I'm lending Greg your jacket. - Whatever. - Let's go. Fuck! - Denny! How's the tux fit? - Dad. What's that? Oh, it's a sculpture I found in Greg's jacket. This isn't a sculpture. It's a device for smoking marijuana. Really? Not mine. It's not. Jack. How are you doing? Like the top hat. It compliments you. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sit down. Did I not clearly explain the Circle of Trust to you, Greg? Mm, yeah. I think I got it. Then, is there something you want to tell me? Mm, I... I don't think so. Didn't we discuss this in the car? Oh! Yes! You mean me and Pam. I'd love to talk to you about that. Not about Pam, we're talking about you. If I can't trust you, Greg, then I have no choice but to put you outside the Circle. And once you're out, there's no coming back. I would definitely like to stay inside the circle. Well, then tell me the truth. OK. Jack, I don't know what we're talking about. All right, Focker, I'm a patient man. That's what 19 months in a Vietnamese prison camp'll do to you. But I will be watching you, studying your every move, and if I find that you are trying to corrupt my firstborn child, I will bring you down, baby. I will bring you down to Chinatown. # What am I gonna do? # Hard to tell # No, I'm not gonna kill myself, but I might as well I thought we were going to Kevin's house. We are, sweetie. This is Kevin's new house. Amazing house! Not bad, huh? Maybe he uses marijuana for medicinal purposes. People do. Look, he's been lying from the start. Hey. Getting some quality time with the boys? Yeah. It was fun. Listen, I hope this lunch isn't too weird for you. Why would ""BBQ at Best Man's"" be weird? Oh, my God, Greg! I was sure I told you. Kevin is Bob's best man. This is his place. Kevin, your ex-fianc? How does he know Bob? Well, they... went to Lacrosse Camp together, and Kevin was the one who introduced Bob to Debbie. Lacrosse Camp? I was able to salvage this wood from an old chapel in Nantucket. The house is amazing. Thank you. OK, the sun is out, the grill is hot and the pool is luke, so if I can interest you in a swim and a BBQ, just follow me. All right, Kevo. Right on schedule. - Bring it on! - Must've cost a fortune. - You OK, sweetie? - Yeah. I'm really sorry. I thought you knew. It's not a big deal. If I can handle a weekend without sex and cigarettes, I can handle your ex-fianc. OK, thank you. For the floor you're walking on, I chose Bolivian wormwood. It works well in here. I have the Viking range and the twin Sub-Zs. They open up right there. Oh, I get it. Like, hidden. - Yeah, kinda blend in. - Great. Are you a homeowner, Greg? No, no. I rent. So, things are going real well for you, aren't they, Kevo? Things have been going so great lately. I got in early on some wireless IPOs and the stuff just skyrocketed. Greg, what line of work are you in? I'm in healthcare. So you know what I mean. There's lots to be made with the biotech stuff. I don't have to tell you that. How's your portfolio? I'd say strong... to quite strong. Yeah, strike while the iron's hot. Now's the time. Greg's a male nurse. That's right. Thank you, Jack. Wow. That's great, to give something back like that. I'd love to do some volunteer work. The other day, I saw this dog, he had, like, a gimp, he couldn't... It made me feel terrible. I wished I could do something. Well, I get paid, but also it feels, you know, good, so it's kind of, everybody wins. What do you...? You're a Wall Street trader, an investment guy? I don't like to be painted with that brush. Yes, that's my job... Do we have time? OK, I wanna show you what I'm really interested in. Come on, let's go. Wow! Looks like somebody got an ""A"" in wood shop. Yeah, it's always been kind of a hobby. I whittled that out of beechwood. It's beautiful. So, what got you into carpentering? Carpentry? I guess I'd have to say Jesus. He was a carpenter and I figured if you're gonna follow in someone's footsteps, who better than Christ? Greg's Jewish. - Are you? - Yeah. Well, so was JC! Wow. You're in good company. Ha! Right. I'm gonna head to the pool, but why don't you show Greg and Pam the gift? You made a gift? Greg. I just put a fresh coat of lacquer on this, so bear with me with the fumes. Wow! Kev! - Isn't that something? - That's incredible! Roses. Deb's favourite! - Yes, right. - The little holes are for candles? Yes. Later, they'll collect rainfall and make a tiny birdbath. That's great. It's beautiful. What is it? It's an altar. Or you might call it a chuppah? Isn't that sweet? Wow. I'll take it to the Byrnes' and tomorrow Robert and Deborah will meet beneath it to become man and wife. And later, when they purchase a home, maybe it'll grace their garden. Well, that's my... sappy, romantic idea. It must have taken forever to build. Not too bad. About 70 hours, which isn't bad, considering I carved it by hand from one piece of wood. 'Hey, Kevo! 12:15. Time to start the barbecue. ' OK, Mr B. I better get back to playing host. You guys grab your suits and I'll meet you at the pool. I'm gonna pass on the swimming. You can't! I don't even have a suit. 'Pamcake, Pop's got your suit out here. ' - Coming, Dad. - You gotta get going. Gosh, she's great. Congratulations. Thank you. And by the way, she had the nicest things to say about you. Really? Yeah. Gosh, yeah, we had some good times together. Whoo, she is a tomcat! Whew! So, let me hook you up with some trunks, Gregor. - I'm not gonna swim... - I'm not taking no for an answer. Cold buffet's on the left, wine and champagne on the right. Yeah, that'd be grea... Hey, there he is! Get out here. G- man, we got salmon, we got swordfish. What'll it be? Uh... how about a little of both... K-dog... I'm pretty hungry. I think they call that the munchies. Let's go. Come on, Kev. Serve it up! Damn! Come on, team. He's got nothing! Service! - Nice serve, pal. - All right! Whoa, yes! Get it! Come on! - Nice shot, Maverick! - Sweet setup, Iceman! Nice one, Nurse! - Glen, don't be afraid of the ball. - It's Greg. Huddle up, team. Not Glen. Greg is afraid of the ball. This is unacceptable! Here's what we gotta do. - Let's go! - We're getting creamed. If Florence Nightingale played some defence... - Larry, I missed one shot. - It was a big shot! Larry, keep floating. Denny, go deep. Greg, nobody's expecting much from you so if I set you up can you spike it? Yeah, I'd have to be pretty high. I bet you would, Panama Red. - All right, look sharp. - Let's play ball! Come on! Let's go! Come on! You got to spike those, Focker! You got to spike. Look how Bob did it. Thanks. Fire it up, Focker! - Let's do it! Good shot! - Way to go, Deb! Greg! - What's the matter with you? - It's only a game! My eye! Oh, my eye! - Pam, help your sister. - I'm sorry, Deb. You can see ""Voight"" backwards on your forehead. Denny! You the bandleader? Go over song selection with Bob. Bob! - Are you a Mr Focker? - Yes. - OK, sign here, please. - Thank you. Hey, your suitcase. You made sure it's all there? Yeah, it's fine. What's up? Just want to make sure you're OK since hitting that spike. - I'm really sorry about that. - That's OK. I don't know what got into me, Iceman. - Iceman? - Sorry, is it special for you two? - No, Greg. Stop it. - Stop what, Iceman? Top Gun was a very popular movie when we dated. That's it. Hey, Iceman, I have no problem with that. Do you wanna be Maverick? Is that what this is about? I can't be, Kevin's Maverick. No, he used to be, but we can change that. Can he be Goose? No, because Goose dies in the end. It's very sad. - Honey, I don't... - Greg, shut up. OK. Dad! You ever think of knocking? Not in my own den. What are you two doing? I'd say rounding second base. This is Greg's room, Dad. Not now - it's storage. Greg's in Deb's room and she'll bunk with you. - Fine. Come on, Greg. - I'll be right up. - Oh, good. They found your suitcase. - Yeah. I don't know what happened at the tux shop but if I gave you the wrong impression regarding Pam in any way, I'm sorry, OK? I have the best intentions with Pam. Actually, there's something in my suitcase that I plan to give her that I think, um, symbolises... ...the level of my commitment to her. And I wouldn't feel right asking her to wear it without her father's permission... Jack? Did you flush this toilet? Maybe... You know what? Maybe Jinx flushed it. I saw Jinxy come in last night and squat and relieve himself. Jinx knows not to use that toilet. If he did, he'd never flush it. What does it matter? The matter, Greg RN, is when this toilet is flushed, it runs. With a near-full septic tank and toilet running all night, you could have a problem. Mr Byrnes? This is not part of my job description. Nice stench. Really on a roll there, bud. Bite me, Denny. In 20 hours there's a wedding here, so I need my cesspool pumped now. Not tomorrow, now! Dad, what's going on? Oh, my God. What's that smell? That smell, Bob, is our shit. Focker made the septic tank overflow. Jack, I told you it wasn't me. It was Jinx. Focker, I'm not gonna tell you again! Jinx cannot flush the toilet! He's a cat, for Christ's sakes! He doesn't have thumbs, Focker! - Hey, look at this! - Kevo! Over by the tree, right? No, no, not on the lawn. Stay where you are! - Not on the lawn! - Kevin! No, no! What the heck? # I got my mojo working # Just won't work on you # I got my mojo working # Just won't work on you... # Oh, no! That's what I said I wanted cos it is a black Samsonite suitcase. But, you think that it's possible that Samsonite, in some crazy scheme to turn a profit, made more than one? - 'I don't think so, sir. ' - Really, you don't? Hey! Jinxy, stop. I know I signed for it... Don't tell me... What? Do me a favour. Can I talk to your supervisor? - Hmm? What's your name? - 'Joy. ' - Get me your supervisor. - 'He's on a break. ' When he gets back, have him give me a call, OK? It's a very important bag. Jinx! Don't ask me what for, I just need you to do this thing. I'm in a time situation so just do it. - 'OK. Greg Focker? ' - Greg or Gregory. Run both names. Psst! Jinx! Psst, psst! Come on! No! Jinx, come here! Jinxy! Mew, mew, mew. No! No! Jinx! Shit! Greg didn't ace his med school Boards. He never even took the MCATs. Oh, Jack, that's what you had your sources check out? What this poor boy did on some test scores? I bet he doesn't have a real nursing degree. A lot of these hospital workers are pill poppers looking for 'ludes. We know he's been puffing the magic dragon. I knew the little cracker was lying. Jinxy! Come here. Come here, little Jinxy. # Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat # I won't hurt you # The fact is, Greg lied to you. He did not lie to me, Dad! You should know the truth. I love you too much to see you get hurt. I don't care what your information says, Greg took the MCATs, OK? Shit! Oh, my God! All right, all right, stand back! Stay back. Call 911. Jinxy. Jinxy! We checked every yard, nobody's seen him. He's not up in the trees. - Jinx isn't up here. - The neighbours haven't seen him. You tried to milk him, you son of a bitch! Dad, stop it! That's enough! Please calm down. How? 15 minutes to go and the ring bearer's missing. - The ring bearer? - Your daddy didn't tell you? He taught Jinx to walk down the aisle with this little pillow. Oh, no, no, you didn't, Dad. Yeah, you put this around the neck and the ribbons are for the rings. Oh, for Christ's sakes! - Oh, Dad. - Now we can't have the rehearsal. Bob, you ride with me. Larry, come with your car. If we're not back in an hour, we'll reschedule for the morning. No! We cannot cancel the rehearsal for some stupid cat. How could you say that? That cat's been like a brother to you! We just let him wander the streets without food, water or toilet? - Dad, Greg'll find him. - What? Yeah, what? That's wonderful. Fine. Fine. OK. Denny? Denny? Denny! Dad, I'm here. Oh, OK. You'll be the ring bearer for now. I'm not wearing that stupid pillow on my head. Oh, yes, you damn well will! Jinx! Jinx! Come on, Jinx. ""Let him wander the streets without food, water or toilet... ""Focker""! Actually, you may be in luck. They brought in a Himalayan a little while ago. There he is. Holy shit! That's Jinx! - Jinxy... - Uh, let me see that photo again. Picture him without the stupid cap. Jinxy! Jinxy! Uh, no. You see, in the picture your cat has an all black tail, and this one has a white tip. No, I'm sorry about that, chief. Looks just like him. Almost. Except for that tail. Dearly beloved... Dearly beloved! We are gathered here today to join Dr Robert Banks... Dearly beloved! We are gathered here on this beautiful day to join... ...in holy matrimony. This is a special day... He found him! It's him! Oh, Daddy, it's Jinx! My little baby! We found you! We found you! This is great! - Way to go, Greg! - Gave us a little scare, huh? Jinxy! # Oh, for once in my life # I got someone who needs me... # To Greg! To Greg! - Where is Greg? - In the rest room. Yes, I've tried every shelter in the north shore. He's a brown and black Himalayan with an all black tail. Mr Jinx. Yeah, you check. I'll call back. Hey, it's the man of the hour. Sorry, folks. Had to pay a visit to the urinal fairy. Greg, nice work with the cat today. Thanks, Jack. Glad I could help. Hey, we never did finish that little convo in the den. So there is still something I'd like to talk about. We'll get right to it as soon as we get back. I'm gonna hold you to that. Circle of Trust. Guess who's back in the Circle of Trust? Oh, poor Kevin looks lonely. I should ask him to dance. What do you think? Sure. He could, uh, whittle a private dance floor for you two. I'm serious. I saw some beechwood outside. He's very handy. He's an extremely handy... and crafty craftsman. I shouldn't say that, but... Come on, seriously. Part of you wishes you ended up with him. Yes, he's very talented. But it would have never worked out. Why not? I was never in love with Kevin. I'm in love with you. - That's a good explanation. - Think so? - Thought you'd like that. - I do. I'm glad. No, Jinx. Mr Jinx. I called you half an hour ago. OK, I already... I already described it. Airline. Uh, it's... It's... brown... With a little bit of black... trim. Yes. 'Please enter your four-digit code. ' 'Jack, it's Hank from next door. 'Guess who wandered over here today? 'Mr Jinx. He's not wearing his collar, but it's Jinxy. 'So just give me a jingle when you guys get home, 'and I'll bring the rascal over. ' OK, just, uh, keep checking, please, and I'll call back. Thanks. - Any luck? - No, they're still looking. Jack, this is a great party. Sometimes things just come together in their own... kookie sort of way. Yeah. Like the way you found Jinxy at that animal shelter, huh? Yeah-huh. Right. - Well, he's home now. - Yes. You know, something about that ball of fur just puts a big smile on my face. - Mm. - Yeah. You haven't seen his new tricks? No. - Well, I'll show you. - We don't have to do it tonight. - He's probably tired. - No, he'd like to show you tonight. Honey, I'll drive. - Hey, Larry, why don't I drive? - Good idea! I've always wanted to test-drive a Benz. Be my guest, Focker. - Sweetie, what are you doing? - Larry said I could drive. - Let's go. Hurry, hurry. - Bye, guys. Thanks for driving, Greg. - Drives better than a Taurus, huh? - Yeah. - Get in the car, honey. Hurry up. - OK, OK. Whoa, Nelly! Everybody comfortable? You're a little wild man at that wheel! That's a ride, man! Got your seat belts on back there? Oh, Jesus, Focker! - Jeez, take it easy! - Benz drives like a dream. Don't make it a nightmare. Oh, there's Jack. Hey, Jackie. You wanna play, pops? Let's play. OK, now, Greg... Greg? Is everything OK, honey? Yeah, just trying to make good time. What is the matter with you? All right, we're gonna get home, very soon. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's not the autobahn! Come on, Greg! Maybe you should drive, honey. Oh, no. Oh, no, please. - Yes! - Jack just turned. You were supposed to make that left at the light... Focker. I'm gonna be sick. Where is he going? Home, home, home. What a ride. Who gave him the keys? OK, we're out. Does he have a licence? Yeah, a licence to kill. Hey, nice driving, Mario! Lunatic. You're a lunatic! Aw, leave him alone. - It's everything! - The cat! God damn you, Jinx! I'll get you...! Dad! Hey, hey! Dad! Calm down! Where's the cat?! - Cat got out! Cat got out! - All right... You spray-painted his tail to make him look like Jinxy, didn't you? What's he talking about? Hank Macatee called me and told me he found Jinxy. He put his collar on an impostor, then spray-painted his tail, then he tried to beat us back to get rid of the evidence! Oh, no, he... Please tell me that's not true, Greg. It was just a temporary solution until I could find the real Jinx. How could you do something like that? I'm sorry. What are you gonna say next - that you set Kevin's altar on fire? Oh, my God! Well, it wasn't intentional. I was... chasing Jinx... I had a smoke, and I think I lit something... I don't know. He put so much... goddam lacquer on that thing. It was an accident waiting to happen! This is very disappointing, Greg. Get out of my house, Focker, and take your friend with you. So you lied about everything? The cat, the fire... - The MCATs... - I didn't lie about the MCATs. Pam, don't you see? Your dad has turned you against me! I didn't turn her against you. You did that. Jack, you didn't like me from the second I walked in here! I'm a very accepting person, Focker. All I ask for is honesty. You want honesty? You wanna talk about truth and honesty? OK, let's talk a little operation... Ko Samui... - Jack. - What's he talking about, Dad? I thought there weren't any secrets inside the Circle of Trust. - I don't know what you mean. - You don't, huh? Cat got your tongue? Pam, Daddy's planning a covert operation in Thailand for the day after the wedding. You are? Round and round we go, Jack. They'd love to hear about your rendezvous in the parking lot, where the guy gave you the passports and documents? Or your little phone call in Thai? Jack can't talk Thai. Oh, no, Dina, Jack can talk Thai. Jack talks Thai very well. I'm sorry, Pam, but your dad is not retired. He's still very much in the CIA. Daddy? He... he's right. He's right. I... I... My... my cover's blown. I... I am planning a secret operation the day after the wedding. What? A surprise honeymoon for Deb and Bob. You stupid son of a bitch! You just blew it! What? Ko Samui's an island off the coast of Thailand! That guy in the parking lot is my travel agent! He was giving me their visas! Wow, Thailand. Thanks a lot, JB. That's some... Don't mention it. I just... You know, if nursing doesn't work out, you have a career in espionage. Thanks, Greg. Well, I guess I'm gonna go to the airport now. I guess you're gonna stay here? Pam, I... It's OK. It's OK. Gaylord M. Focker? ""Gaylord""? Yeah, that's me. - I thought your name was Greg? - It is. - That's not on the form. - It's my legal name, since I was in third grade. Whatever. Wait, wait, wait. Your name's Gay Focker? - Denny. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's not a normal name, you know? You're in luck. There is room... And without a Saturday stay-over that fare difference will be $1,137 and 11 cents. - Did you want me to book this seat? - OK. All right. Did you want to check any bags? We should be all right with only one usher. I'm not so sure, Jack. Thought you might like to see this. - How did you get this? - I have my sources too. I called Gaylord - AKA Greg's parents in Detroit. They saved his SATs, too, in case you're interested. Oh, honey, it doesn't matter if he did well in some test. Look at this! He almost destroyed the wedding because he lied! I love you, Daddy... but you can be a real jerk sometimes. So what if he took the MCATs? He's still not good enough for Pam. Who is, Jack? Nobody has ever been good enough for your Pam. I mean, do you realise that you never even warmed up to Kevin until she broke up with him? Maybe it's time to think about what Pam wants. Greg, it's me. I'm sure you're in the air by now, so, um, I guess you'll get this when you get home. Listen, I am so sorry. I acted like a complete idiot, and... And I hope that you can forgive me. I mean, I... I don't care about... the fire or the cat or... I mean, I can't believe you actually... spray-painted a cat... It's actually really gross. But the point is that... that I understand why you did it, and... and I love you. I want you to know that I really, I really, really love you and... So when you get this, will you please call me? OK, bye. I need a commercial flight ID scan. New York, La Guardia to Chicago. Four-hour sweeps, last name Foxtrot-Oscar- Charlie-Kilo-Echo-Romeo, first name Golf-Alpha-Yankee... 'Gaylord Focker, Atlantic American flight 27. Departs 2:35.' - 'Affirmative. ' 23 minutes. Thanks. Enjoy your flight. Hello. Sorry, we're only boarding rows nine and above. You'll have to wait. I'm in row eight. Please step aside, sir. It's one row. Is it OK if I...? We'll call your row momentarily. Step aside, sir. Thank you for waiting. We're now boarding all rows, please. All remaining rows. Oh. Hello. Mm-hm. Enjoy your flight. Excuse me. OK, where's the fire, huh? - Sir, you'll have to check that. - I got it. - No, sorry, that bag won't fit. - I'm not checking my bag. Don't raise your voice, sir. I'm not raising my voice. This would be raising my voice! I don't wanna check my bag. And your airline, you suck at checking bags. I did that once and you lost it, and everything screwed up for me. I assure you your bag will be placed safely below with the other luggage. Oh, yeah? How do you know my bag is safe below? Are you gonna take my bag and put it there? Are you gonna go with the guys with the earmuffs and put it there? - No. - OK, then shut your pie hole and listen to me when I say that I am finished with the checking-of-the-bags conversation! Sir, if a bag is this large... OK, you know what? Get your grubby little paws off of my bag! It's not like I have a bomb to blow up the plane. I just want to stow my bag according to regulations! Sir! Sir! If you would take the sticks out of your head you would see that all I have to do is do what I wanna do, and all I wanna do is hold on to my bag and not listen to you. The only way I would let go would be if you tried to pry it from my dead, lifeless fingers, OK? If you can get it from my kung-fu grip, then you can have it. Otherwise, step off, bitch! Get off of me! Get off of me! Keep your... Hey! You can't leave your vehicle unattended! So tow it. You threatened that stewardess. I was just trying to get my bag into the overhead storage thing! - You threatened her with a bomb! - I said I didn't have a bomb! - You said bomb. - I said I didn't have a bomb. - You said bomb on an aeroplane - What's wrong with that? You can't say ""bomb"" on aeroplanes. Bomb, bomb, bomb. Bomb, bomb, bomb-bomb. - Arrest me! - Assaulting an... What if I was a bombardier? Norm. Take five. We got a specialist. Bye, Norm. Oh, shit. How'd you get here? I'm everywhere, Focker. - I didn't do anything, Jack. - Yeah, I know. Then tell these guys that I'm not a terrorist. I'm not telling anyone anything until you answer some questions. Unless you wanna go to prison, you better tell me the truth. No more lies, understand? No more lies. - Did you do this? - Answer the question. - Did you get me taken off the plane? - Put your hands over there. You're sick, you know that? Is your name Gaylord Focker? Yes or no. Yes. - Are you a male nurse? - Yes. - Are you a pot head? - No. - Have you ever smoked pot? - Yes. Did you spray-paint the tail of a cat to pass him off as Mr Jinx? Yes. Because you were seeking my approval? Yes. - Because you love Pam? - Yes. Do you want to marry her? Do you want to marry her? I did. Till I met you. What does that mean? I love your daughter. I love her more than anything. But frankly, sir, I'm terrified of being your son-in-law. This weekend has made me doubt that I could even survive in your family. I think you've got some serious issues. If I lighten up, would you consider marrying my daughter? Would you lighten up a lot? - Y... - Yes or no? - Yes. - Would you let us live our lives? I promise not to interfere in your lives. Stop making fun of me for being a nurse? Could you at least try to consider another profession? - Jack, yes or no? - Ever? - No. - OK, yes. - Let me and Pam sleep together? - Don't push it, Focker. You're in a real mess. Would you support my daughter the way she deserves to be? Yes. Would you be honest and faithful? Yes. Will you devote yourself entirely to her for the rest of your life? Of course. Gaylord Focker... Will you be my son-in-law? Greg? I thought you were going back to Chicago. We had a little plane trouble. Plus, your dad caught up with me at the airport. Don't... don't worry, it's OK. We worked out a lot of our issues. You and my dad worked out a lot of your issues? He gave me his human lie detector thing, but I passed. - Good. - Yeah. And... then he proposed. Are you feeling all right? Listen... This weekend was a nightmare. Oh. I had this elaborate plan, but somewhere... between giving your sister a black eye and... setting the house on fire, it kind of went off track. I just... I love you. I love you so much. I don't know, it makes no sense... I think he's about to do it. Come on, honey. Give 'em some privacy. And if we can get through... what we got through in the last 48 hours, we could get through anything. I think so, too. - And I don't... - Wait, hang on a sec. Mr Jinx. Mew mew mew mew. Mew mew mew mew. Hi, Jinx... It's a ring. I like to think of it as a little circle of trust. Pam... Will you marry me? Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Attaboy, Greg. That ""circle of trust"" thing, that's mine. Well, looks like we've got another wedding to plan. Yup. Just got to do one more thing. - What's that? - Meet his parents. - Jack... - Honey, relax. I'm sure they're wonderful, fascinating people. Good night, Jack. I mean, they'd have to be, right? To name their son Gaylord Focker? Do you, Deborah Byrnes, take Robert Banks to be your wedded husband? Yes! I mean, I do! I now pronounce you man and wife. Let's just see if you really can flush the toilet, Jinxy. I knew it. 'Oh! Shit! ' I knew it. 'Damn! ' That's my future son-in-law. What do you think? 'Hello, Jack. 'Aw, look at that. Nice, Jack. Hi. 'What's that, Jack? What? 'You're a big, fat, CIA man, huh? 'Did they teach you THAT...? They teach you THAT? 'Oh, yeah, what's that, Jack? 'You thought ""Puff"" was just the name of the boy's magic dragon? 'Not too quick on the uptake, huh? 'Why don't you ask Denny? Not onto that one, huh? 'Surprising for a big CIA pulse detector. 'Ooh, hey, check my pulse on this question. 'Do I think you're a psycho? Yes. 'What? Oh, you like my little... gift? 'What? The Jerusalem what? 'I can't hear you. Jerusalem tulipoosy-posly-lit...? 'What? Oh, you don't know shit about flowers. You want me to what? 'A question? Sure... 'Can you deal with THAT?! ' # When you're a fool in love # Seems like the skies are always grey # You turn around, there's someone in your way # And it's you # And you're in love # Never another spring for you # Never a robin to sing for you # You're out there on your own # When you're a fool # In love # Quand tu es fou d'amour # Le ciel parat toujours plus bleu # Tu te retournes y'a quelqu'un qui te gne # Mais c'est toi, tu es amoureux # Jamais un autre printemps pour toi # Jamais les oiseaux chanteront pour toi # Tu es tout perdu tout seul # Quand tu es fou d'amour # Des fois tu crois voir ta chance tourner # Devant toi surgit un arc-en-ciel # Mais quand tu es fou d'amour # Tu restes fou jusqu'au dernier jour # Never another spring for you # Jamais les oiseaux chanteront pour toi # You're out there on your own # When you're a fool in love #, I killed Sirius Black! He's back. The police are continuing with the investigation... ... into the cause of the Millennium Bridge disaster. Traffic has been halted as police search for survivors. The surrounding area remains closed. The mayor has urged Londoners to remain calm... ""Harry Potter."" Who's Harry Potter? Oh, no one. Bit of a tosser, really. Funny, that paper of yours. Couple nights ago, I could've sworn I saw a picture move. - Really? - Thought I was going around the twist. - Hey, I was wondering... - Eleven. That's when I get off. You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter. You've been reckless this summer, Harry. I like riding around on trains. Takes my mind off things. Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it? The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself. But now is not the time to tell it. Take my arm. Do as I say. I just Apparated, didn't I? Indeed. Quite successfully too, I might add. Most people vomit the first time. I can't imagine why. Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton. Harry, I assume, right about now, you're wondering why I brought you here. Am I right? Actually, sir, after all these years, I just sort of go with it. Wands out, Harry. Horace? Horace? Merlin's beard! No need to disfigure me, Albus. Well, I must say you make a very convincing armchair, Horace. It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away? Dragon's blood. - Oh. - Oh, yes, introductions. Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine... ...Horace Slughorn. Horace... ...well, you know who this is. Harry Potter. What's with all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't, by any chance, waiting for someone else? Someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean. All right, the Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year. Do you know what that's like? You can only say no so many times, so I never stay anywhere more than a week. Muggles who own this are in the Canary Islands. Well, I think we should put it back in order for them, don't you? Mind. That was fun. - Do you mind if I use the loo? - No, of course. Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus. The answer's still no. Absolutely and unequivocally, no. You're very like your father. - Except for the eyes. You have your... - My mother's eyes. Yeah. Lily. Lovely Lily. She was exceedingly bright, your mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born. One of my best friends is Muggle-born. Best in our year. Please don't think I'm prejudiced. No, no. Your mother was one of my absolute favorites. Look, there she is. Right at the front. All mine. Each and every one. Ex-students, I mean. You recognize Barnabas Cuffe, editor of The Daily Prophet. Always takes my owl, should I wish to register an opinion... ...on the news of the day. Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies. Free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time. Ah, yes. Regulus Black. You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius. Died a few weeks ago. I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius. It's a shame. Talented boy. I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set. Horace? Do you mind if I take this? - I do love knitting patterns. - Yes, of course. But you're not leaving? I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable. I would have considered it a personal triumph... ...had you consented to return to Hogwarts. Oh, well. You're like my friend Mr. Potter here, one of a kind. Well, bye-bye, Horace. Bye. All right. I'll do it. But I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water closet I had before. And I expect a raise. These are mad times we live in. Mad! They are indeed. Sir, exactly what was all that about? You are talented, famous and powerful. Everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn is gonna try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning jewel. That's why he's returning to Hogwarts. And it's crucial he should return. I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl. It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse. Oh, you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry. But, sir, what about Hedwig? And my trunk? Both are waiting for you. Hedwig. Mum? Ginny, what is it? I was only wondering when Harry got here. - What? Harry? Harry who? - Harry Potter, of course. I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I? - His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl. - No, dear, I seriously doubt that. Harry? Did someone say ""Harry""? Me, nosy. Is he up there with you? Of course not. I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I? - Is that an owl? - You haven't seen him, have you? He's wandering about the house. - Really? - Really. Harry! Harry! Hello. What a lovely surprise. Why didn't you let us know you were coming? - I didn't know. Dumbledore. - Oh, that man. But then, what would we do without him? Got a bit of toothpaste. So when did you get here? A few days ago. Though for a while, I wasn't sure I was coming. Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts. That it's too dangerous. - Oh, come on. - She's not alone. Even my parents, and they're Muggles, know something bad's happening. Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy... ...and it took a few days, but she came around. But this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer? There's been a lot of talk recently that... ...Dumbledore's got a bit old. Rubbish! Well, he's only... What is he? Hundred and fifty? Give or take a few years. Cissy! You can't do this! He can't be trusted! The Dark Lord trusts him. - The Dark Lord's mistaken. - Pfft. Run along, Wormtail. I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself forbade me to speak of this. If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak. Put it down, Bella. We mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it so happens, I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa. You? The Dark Lord told you? Your sister doubts me. Understandable. Over the years I've played my part well. So well, I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time. Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it. I don't doubt you, Severus. You should be honored, Cissy. As should Draco. He's just a boy. I can't change the Dark Lord's mind. But it might be possible for me to help Draco. - Severus. - Swear to it. Make the Unbreakable Vow. It's just empty words. He'll give it his best effort. But when it matters most... ...he'll just slither back into his hole. Coward. Take out your wand. Will you... ...Severus Snape... ...watch over Draco Malfoy... ...as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes? I will. And will you, to the best of your ability... ...protect him from harm? I will. And if Draco should fail... ...will you yourself carry out the deed... ...the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform? I will. Step up! Step up! We've got Fainting Fancies! Nosebleed Nougats! - And just in time for school... - Puking Pastilles! - Into the cauldron, handsome. - Into the cauldron, handsome. I will have order! I really hate children. I will have order! I really hate children. I will have order! - Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. - A real money spinner, that. Handy if you need to make a quick getaway. - Hello, ladies. - Hello, ladies. - Love potions, eh? - Yeah, they really do work. Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own. Meaning? Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas? It's none of your business. How much for this? - Five Galleons. - Five Galleons. - How much for me? - Five Galleons. I'm your brother. - Ten Galleons. - Ten Galleons. Come on, let's go. Hi, Ron. Hi. How are Fred and George doing it? Half the Alley's closed down. Fred reckons people need a laugh these days. I reckon he's right. Oh, no. Everyone got their wands from Ollivander's. Harry? Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy look like two people... ...who don't want to be followed? Quibbler. Quibbler. He's lovely. They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. - Quibbler? - Oh, please. - What's a Wrackspurt? - They're invisible creatures. They float in your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler. So, what was Draco doing with that weird-looking cabinet? And who were all those people? Don't you see? It was a ceremony, an initiation. Stop it, Harry. I know where you're going. It's happened. He's one of them. One of what? Harry is under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater. You're barking. What would You-Know-Who want with Malfoy? Well, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture? It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke. Look, his father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense. Hermione saw it with her own eyes. I told you, I don't know what I saw. I need some air. Don't worry. When we get to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out. - What was that? Blaise? - Don't know. Relax, boys. It's probably just a first-year messing around. Come on, Draco. Sit down. We'll be at Hogwarts soon. Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school. I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower... ...if I had to continue for another two years. What's that supposed to mean? Let's just say you won't see me wasting my time in Charms class next year. Amused, Blaise? We'll see just who's laughing in the end. You two go on. I wanna check something. Where's Harry? He's probably already on the platform. Come on. Didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus. Oh, yeah... ...she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin. That's for my father. Enjoy your ride back to London. Finite. - Hello, Harry. - Luna! - How'd you know where I was? - Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them. Sorry I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna. That's all right. It was like being with a friend. Oh, I am your friend, Luna. That's nice. About time. I've been looking all over for you two. Right. Names? Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years. No exceptions, Potter. Who are those people? Aurors. For security. What's this cane here, then? It's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick. And what exactly would you be wanting with a...? Could be construed as an offensive weapon. It's all right, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy. Nice face, Potter. Would you like me to fix it for you? Personally, I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way... ...but it's up to you. Well, have you ever fixed a nose before? No, but I've done several toes, and how different are they, really? Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go. - Episkey. - Ah! - How do I look? - Exceptionally ordinary. Brilliant. Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute. Will you stop eating? Your best friend is missing! Oi. Turn around, you lunatic. He's covered in blood again. - Why is it he's always covered in blood? - Looks like it's his own this time. Where have you been? - What happened to your face? - Later. What've I missed? Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times. Easy for it to say, huh? It's a hat, isn't it? Very best of evenings to you all. Thanks. First off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff... ...Horace Slughorn. Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say... ...has agreed to resume his old post as Potions Master. Meanwhile, the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts... ...will be taken by Professor Snape. Snape? Now, as you know... ...each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival here tonight. And you have the right to know why. Once there was a young man, who, like you... ...sat in this very hall... ...walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roof. He seemed to all the world a student like any other. His name? Tom Riddle. Today, of course... ...he's known all over the world by another name. Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight... ...I'm reminded of a sobering fact. Every day, every hour... ...this very minute, perhaps... ...dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls. But in the end, their greatest weapon is you. Just something to think about. Now, off to bed. Pip-pip. That was cheerful. History of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down. Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies! That is the girls' lavatory. Potter. Oh, this can't be good. Enjoying ourselves, are we? - I had a free period this morning. - So I noticed. I would think you would want to fill it with Potions. Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror? It was, but I was told I had to get an ""Outstanding"" in my O.W.L. So you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. s students... ...with ""Exceeds Expectations."" Brilliant. Um... - Well, I'll head there straightaway. - Oh, good, good. Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there. I don't wanna take Potions. This is Quidditch trials coming up. I need to practice. Attention to detail in the preparation... ...is the prerequisite of all planning. Ah. Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry. We've brought someone with us, I see. Ron Weasley, sir. But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace, actually. - I'm gonna... - Nonsense, we'll sort you out. Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out. I haven't actually got my book yet, and nor has Ron. Get what you want from the cupboard. Now, as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning. Any ideas what these might be? - Yes, Miss...? - Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. It's a truth-telling serum. And that would be Polyjuice Potion. It's terribly tricky to make. And this is Amortentia... ...the most powerful love potion in the world. It's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them. For example, I smell... ...freshly mown grass, and new parchment, and... ...spearmint toothpaste. Amortentia doesn't create actual love. That would be impossible. But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. And for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room. Sir? You haven't told us what's in that one. Oh, yes. What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen... ...is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as... - Liquid luck. - Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck. Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong. One sip and you will find that all of your endeavors succeed. At least until the effects wear off. So this is what I offer each of you today. One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who, in the hour that remains... ...manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death... ...the recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books. I should point out, however, only once did a student manage to brew a potion... ...of sufficient quality to claim this prize. Nevertheless, good luck to you all. Let the brewing commence. How did you do that? You crush it. Don't cut it. No. The instructions specifically say to cut. No, really. Merlin's beard! It is perfect. So perfect I daresay one drop would kill us all. So here we are, then, as promised. One vial of Felix Felicis. Congratulations. Use it well. Harry, you got my message. Come in. How are you? I'm fine, sir. Enjoying your classes? I know Professor Slughorn is most impressed with you. I think he overestimates my abilities, sir. Do you? Definitely. What about your activities outside the classroom? - Sir? - Well, I notice you spend... ...a great deal of time with Miss Granger. I can't help wondering... Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant, and we're friends, but, no. Forgive me. I was merely being curious. But enough chitchat. You must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight. The answer lies here. What you are looking at are memories. In this case, pertaining to one individual, Voldemort... ...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle. This vial contains the most particular memory... ...of the day I first met him. I'd like you to see it, if you would. I admit some confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore. In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. There have been incidents with the other children. Nasty things. Tom, you have a visitor. How do you do, Tom? Don't. - You're the doctor, aren't you? - No. I am a professor. I don't believe you. She wants me looked at. They think I'm different. Well, perhaps they're right. I'm not mad. Hogwarts is not a place for mad people. Hogwarts is a school. A school of magic. You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things other children can't. I can make things move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me. I can make them hurt... ...if I want. Who are you? Well, I'm like you, Tom. I'm different. Prove it. I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom. Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom. At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it. You understand me? I can speak to snakes too. They find me. Whisper things. Is that normal for someone like me? Did you know, sir? Then? Did I know I'd just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No. If I had, I... Over time, while here at Hogwarts... ...Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher. Can you guess who that teacher might be? You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you? No, I did not. You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not give it up easily. You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me. I did. Do you want me to let him? Yes. All right. Um... This morning, I'm gonna be putting you all through a few drills... ...just to assess your strengths. Quiet! Please! Shut it! Thanks. All right. Um... Just because you made the team last year... ...does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear? Good. No hard feelings, Weasley, all right? Hard feelings? Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well. It's nothing personal. Really? Strapping guy like you? You've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think? Keepers need to be quick, agile. Oh, I like my chances. Say, think you could introduce me to your friend Granger? Wouldn't mind getting on a first-name basis, know what I mean? Come on, Weasley! - Come on, Ron! - Go on, Weasley! - Go on, Weasley! - Yeah, Ron! Go on, Cormac! Come on, Ron! Come on, Ron. Come on, Ron. Confundus. Isn't he brilliant? I have to admit, I thought I was gonna miss that last one. I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard. He's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac. He's vile. Have you ever heard of this spell? Sectumsempra? No, I haven't. And if you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in. Not bloody likely. He's top of the class. He's even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he's a genius. What? I'd like to know whose that book was. Let's have a look. No. Why not? The binding is fragile. - The binding is fragile? - Yeah. - Who's the Half-Blood Prince? - Who? That's what it says right here: ""This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince."" For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... ... yet you have no desire to find out who he is? I didn't say I wasn't curious, and I don't sleep with it. Well, it's true. I like a nice chat before I go to bed. Now all you do is read that bloody book. It's just like being with Hermione. Well, I was curious, so I went to... - The library. - The library. And? And nothing. I couldn't find a reference anywhere to a Half-Blood Prince. - There we go. That settles it, then. - Filius! I was hoping to find you in the Three Broomsticks! No, emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace. Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer? A chum of mine was sledging down Claxby Hill. We had a very long, homemade, Norwegian-style sledge... No, not there. Over here. No, sit beside me. Okay. Something to drink? Three Butterbeers, and some ginger in mine, please. Oh, bloody hell. Slick git. Honestly, Ronald, they're only holding hands. And snogging. - I'd like to leave. - What? You can't be serious. - That happens to be my sister. - So? What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? You expect her to leave? - Hey, my boy! - Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you. And you, and you. So, what brings you here? The Three Broomsticks and I go way back, further than I care to admit. I can remember when it was One Broomstick. All hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my boy, in the old days... ...I used to throw together the occasional supper party... ...for the select student or two. - Would you be game? - I'd consider it an honor, sir. You would be welcome too, Granger. - I'd be delighted, sir. - Splendid. Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby. What are you playing at? Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him. - Get to know him? - I don't know. It must be important. If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask. Got a little bit... Katie, you don't know what it could be. - Harry. - What? Did you hear what she said back at the pub about me and her snogging? As if. I warned her. I warned her not to touch it. Don't get any closer. Get back, all of you. Do not touch that, except by the wrappings. Do you understand? You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession... ...when she entered the Three Broomsticks? It's like I said. She left to go to the loo, and when she came back she had the package. She said it was important that she deliver it. - Did she say to whom? - To Professor Dumbledore. Very well. Thank you, Leanne. You may go. Why is it when something happens it is always you three? Believe me, professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years. McGONAGALL: Oh, Severus. What do you think? I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive. She was cursed, wasn't she? I know Katie. Off the pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly. If she was delivering that to Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly. Yes, she was cursed. It was Malfoy. That is a very serious accusation, Potter. Indeed. - Your evidence? - I just know. You just... ...know. You astonish with your gifts, Potter. Gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing. How grand it must be to be the Chosen One. I suggest you go back to your dormitories. All of you. What do you suppose Dean sees in her? Ginny? Well, what does she see in him? Dean? He's brilliant. You called him a slick git not five hours ago. Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he? Something snaps, and you've gotta hate him, you know? On principle. I suppose. - So, what is it he sees in her? - I don't know. She's smart, funny. - Attractive. - Attractive? - You know, she's got nice skin. - Skin? Dean dates my sister because of her skin? Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor. Hermione's got nice skin. Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean. I've never really thought about it. But, I suppose, yeah. Very nice. - I think I'll be going to sleep now. - Right. Yeah. So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your Uncle Tiberius these days? Yes, sir. In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him... ...and the Minister for Magic over the holidays. Well, be sure to give them both my best. What about your uncle, Belby? For those who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion. - Is he working on anything new? - Don't know. Him and Dad don't get on. Probably because me dad says potions are rubbish. Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day. What about you, Miss Granger? What does your family do in the Muggle world? My parents are dentists. They tend to people's teeth. Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession? No. Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick, did bite my father once. He needed 10 stitches. Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in. Look at her eyes. They've been fighting again, her and Dean. Sorry. I'm not usually late. No matter. You're just in time for dessert, that is, if Belby's left you any. What? Nothing. Goodbye. Bye-bye. - Potter. - I'm sorry, sir. I was just admiring your hourglass. Oh, yes. A most intriguing object. The sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation. If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly. - If it is not... - I think I'll be going. Nonsense. You have nothing to fear, dear boy. As to some of your classmates... ...well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf. The shelf, sir? Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here. But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry? Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? You knew him, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle? You were his teacher. Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst here at Hogwarts. What was he like? I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents. Of course. It's only natural you should want to know more. But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet... ...albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard. Not unlike others I've known. Not unlike yourself, in fact. If the monster existed... ...it was buried deep within. Good luck, eh, Ron. - Nice hat! - Ron, you're a loser. I'm counting on you, Ron. I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah? - Looking good, Ron. - Loser! What's he wearing? So how was it, then? - How was what? - Your dinner party? Pretty boring, actually. Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert. Slughorn's having a Christmas do, you know. And we're meant to bring someone. I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. He's in the Slug Club, isn't he? - Actually, I was going to ask you. - Really? Good luck today, Ron. I know you'll be brilliant. I'm resigning. After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot. Have it your way. - Juice? - Sure. Hello, everyone. You look dreadful, Ron. Is that why you put something in his cup? Is it a tonic? Liquid luck. Don't drink it, Ron. - You could be expelled for that. - I don't know what you're talking about. Come on, Harry. We've got a game to win. Yes! Go on, Ron! Do it! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Yes! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Whoo! Yes. Whoo! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! You really shouldn't have done it. I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm. That was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game. You didn't put it in. Ron only thought you did. Charms spell. I'm just practicing. Well, they're really good. How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny? I know. I see the way you look at her. You're my best friend. Oops. I think this room's taken. What's with the birds? Oppugno. It feels like this. Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist. What Lav and I have, well, let's just say, there's no stopping it. It's chemical. Will it last? Who knows? Point is, I'm a free agent. He's at perfect liberty to kiss whoever he likes. I really couldn't care less. Was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party? Yes. Now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements. Have you? Yes. Why? I just thought, seeing as neither of us can go with who we'd really like to... ...we should go together, as friends. Why didn't I think of that? Who are you going with? Um, it's a surprise. Anyway, it's you we've got to worry about. You can't just take anyone. See that girl over there? That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's trying to smuggle you a love potion. Really? Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One. But I am the Chosen One. Okay, sorry. Um, kidding. I'll ask someone I like. Someone cool. I've never been to this part of the castle. At least not while awake. I sleepwalk, you see. That's why I wear shoes to bed. Harmonia Nectere Passus. Harmonia Nectere Passus. Harmonia Nectere Passus. Drink? Neville. I didn't get into the Slug Club. It's okay, though. He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo. - Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks. - Okay. Hermione. What are you doing? And what happened to you? I've just escaped. I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe. Cormac? That's who you invited? I thought it would annoy Ron the most. Thank you. I'll catch up with you later. He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant. - Dragon tartare? - No, I'm fine. Thank you. Just as well. They give one horribly bad breath. On second thoughts... Might keep Cormac at bay. Oh, God, here he comes. I think she just went to powder her nose. Slippery little minx, your friend. Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she? What is this I'm eating, by the way? Dragon balls. You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen. Not so quick, Potter. Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date... Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two. Besides, I only wish to convey a message. - A message? - From Professor Dumbledore. He asked me to give you his best, and he hopes you enjoy your holiday. You see... ...he's traveling, and he won't return until term resumes. Traveling where? Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib! Professor Slughorn, sir. I just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party. Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy? I'll escort him out. Certainly, professor. All right, everyone, carry on, carry on. Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't. What's it to you? I swore to protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow. I don't need protection. I was chosen for this. Out of all others. Me. - And I won't fail him. - You're afraid, Draco. You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you. No! I was chosen. This is my moment. ""Unbreakable Vow."" You're sure that's what Snape said? Positive. Why? Well, it's just you can't break an Unbreakable Vow. I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. You don't understand. Oh, bloody hell. I miss you. Lovely. All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look. I'll take your word for it. So, what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow? You die. Wait, the pudding's still here. Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission? I know it sounds mad. Has it occurred to you Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help... ...so he could find out what he was up to? - That's not what it sounded like. - Perhaps Harry's right. To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's... It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgment. - Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do. - Dumbledore can make mistakes. You're blinded by hatred. - I'm not. - Yes, you are. People are disappearing, Harry, daily. We place our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed. Open up, you. Don't you trust me? It's good. Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah. - Pie? - Not for me, no. You'll have to forgive Remus. It takes its toll, his condition. Are you all right, Mr. Weasley? We're being followed, all of us. Most days, Molly doesn't leave the house. It's not been easy. Did you get my owl? Yes, I did. If Dumbledore's traveling, then that's news to the Ministry... ...but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it. As for Draco Malfoy... ...I know a bit more. - Go on. - I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes. I think, from what you described... ...what you and Ron saw in summer... ...the object that Draco is so interested in... ...is a vanishing cabinet. A vanishing cabinet? They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can see the appeal. Should Death Eaters come knocking... ...one simply had to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two. They can transport you anywhere. Tricky contraptions though, very temperamental. What happened to it? The one at Borgin and Burkes? Nothing. It's still there. It was delicious, Molly, really. Are you sure you won't stay? No, we should go. The first night of the cycle's always the worst. Remus? Sweetheart. Has Ron gone to bed? Um... Not yet. No. Shoelace. Merry Christmas, Harry. Merry Christmas. - Harry, no! - Remus! Ginny! I killed Sirius Black! I killed Sirius Black! You coming to get me? Harry, can you get me? You coming to get me? Harry? Stupefy! Harry! Ginny! Molly. It's easy for them to get to you. You're bloody lucky you weren't killed. You have to realize who you are, Harry. I know who I am, Hermione, all right? Sorry. Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it. That's my Won-Won. Excuse me, I have to go and vomit. I'd like to know where you get your information. More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. Sir... ...is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring? Now, Tom. I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I? By the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite. But how did you know? Intuition. Gracious. Is it that time already? Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention. Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours. - Is something on your mind, Tom? - Yes, sir. You see, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to. The other professors, well, they're not like you. They might misunderstand. Go on. I was in the library the other night... ...in the Restricted Section... ...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic. And I thought perhaps you could illuminate me. It's called, as I understand it... I beg your pardon? I don't know anything about such things, and if I did, I wouldn't tell you! Now, get out of here at once, and don't let me ever catch you mentioning it again! Confused? I'd be surprised if you weren't. Well, I don't understand. What happened? This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected. It is also a lie. This memory has been tampered with... ...by the same person whose memory it is, our old friend, Professor Slughorn. But why would he tamper with his own memory? - I suspect he's ashamed of it. - Why? Why, indeed? I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn, and you have done so. Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory... ...any way you can. I don't know him that well, sir. This memory is everything. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance. You have no choice. You must not fail. So I'd highly recommend you reacquaint yourself... ...with the chapter on antidotes. I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. Right, off you go. Alys, don't forget your rat tail. Aha. If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself. To what do I owe this pleasure? Sir, I wondered if I might ask you something. Ask away, dear boy, ask away. The other day I was in the library, in the Restricted Section... ...and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic. Yes. And what was this rare piece of magic? Well, I don't know. I can't remember the name exactly. It got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us? I'm Potions Master, Harry. I think your question'd better be posed to Professor Snape. Yes. Um... He and I don't exactly see eye to eye, sir. What I mean to say is... ...well, he's not like you. He might misunderstand. Yes. There can be no light without the dark. And so it is with magic. Myself, I always strive to live within the light. I suggest you do the same. Is that what you told Tom Riddle, when he came asking questions? Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he? Didn't he? Yes? Oh, it's you, Potter. I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment. It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon. Divine. Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we? It was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one. - Or 20. - I can't stop thinking about her, Harry. Honestly, I reckoned she was annoying you. She could never annoy me. I think I love her. Well, brilliant. Do you think she knows I exist? I hope so. She's been snogging you for three months. Snogging? Who are you talking about? Who are you talking about? Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane. Okay, very funny. - What was that for? - It's no joke! I'm in love with her! Fine, you're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her? No. Can you introduce me? Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you to Romilda Vane. I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential. Where's Romilda? What's the matter with Wenby? Very powerful love potion. Very well. Better bring him in. I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry. Well, I thought this called for a more practiced hand, sir. Hello, darling. Fancy a drink? Perhaps you're right. I'm sorry, by the way, professor, about earlier today, our misunderstanding. Oh, not at all. All water under the bridge, you know? Correct? I expect you're tired of it after all these years. All the questions about Voldemort. Don't use that name. There you are, old boy. Bottoms up. - What's this? - Tonic for the nerves. - What happened to me? - Love potion. A bloody strong one at that. - I feel really bad. - You need a pick-me-up. Got Butterbeer, wine, dazzling oak-matured mead. I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances... Here we are, Potter. To life! Ron. Ron. Professor, do something. I don't understand. Come on, Ron, breathe. These girls, they're gonna kill me. Quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar. You must be very proud of your student, Horace. Hm? Oh, yes, very proud. I think we agree, Potter's actions were heroic. The question is, why were they necessary? Why, indeed? This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't remember who gave you this bottle? Which, by the way, possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry... ...when not polluted with poison. Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself. To whom, I might ask? To you, Headmaster. Where is he? Where's my Won-Won? Has he been asking for me? What's she doing here? I might ask you the same question. I happen to be his girlfriend. I happen to be his friend. Don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks. I suppose you want to make up now that he's all interesting. He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting. Ah. See? He senses my presence. Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here. I'm here. Uh... Hermione... Hermione. Hermione. Oh, to be young, and to feel love's keen sting. Well, come away, everybody. Mr. Weasley is well tended. About time, don't you think? Thank you. Oh, shut up. Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow. Tell me how I broke up with Lavender again. Um, well... ...she came to visit you in the hospital. And you talked. I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation. Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her. It's just she seems a bit put out. Yes, she does, doesn't she? You say you don't remember anything from that night? Anything at all? There is something. But it can't be. I was completely boggled, wasn't I? Right. Boggled. Harry. That's Katie. Katie Bell. Katie. How are you? I know you're going to ask, Harry, but I don't know who cursed me. I've been trying to remember, honestly. But I just can't. Katie? I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her, didn't you? Sectumsempra! Vulnera Sanentur. Vulnera Sanentur. Vulnera Sanentur. You have to get rid of it. Today. Take my hand. The Room of Requirement. We need to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book... ...where no one will ever find it, including you. - What was that? - What was that? See? You never know what you'll find up here. All right, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted. Close your eyes. That can stay hidden up here too, if you like. So did you and Ginny do it, then? What? You know, hide the book? Oh, yeah. Ah. Dear, yes. Still no luck with Slughorn, then, I take it? Luck. That's it. All I need's a bit of luck. Well, how do you feel? Excellent. Really excellent. Remember... ...Slughorn usually eats early... ...takes a walk, and then returns to his office. Right. - I'm going down to Hagrid's. - What? No, Harry, you've got to go and speak to Slughorn. - We have a plan. - I know... ...but I've got a good feeling about Hagrid's. I feel it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean? - No. - Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing. Or Felix does. Hi! Merlin's beard, Harry! Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat, coughed. You probably feared I was Professor Sprout. Yes, I did, actually. What makes you think that? Well, just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around, the jumping when you saw me. Are those Tentacula leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they? Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer. Not that I'm familiar with any such transactions, but one does hear rumors. My own interests are purely academic, of course. Personally, these plants always kind of freaked me out. How did you get out of the castle, Harry? Through the front door, sir. I'm off to Hagrid's. He's a very dear friend... ...and I fancied paying him a visit. So if you don't mind, I will be going now. Harry! - Sir? - It's nearly nightfall. Surely you realize I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself. Well, then, by all means, come along, sir. Harry, I must insist you accompany me... ...back to the castle immediately! That would be counterproductive, sir. And what makes you say that? No idea. Horace. Merlin's beard. Is that an actual Acromantula? A dead one, I think, sir. Good God. Dear fellow, however did you manage to kill it? Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was. - I'm so sorry, I didn't... - Don't worry yourself, you're not alone. Seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are. It's the eyes, I reckon. They unnerve some folk. Not to mention the pincers. Yeah, I reckon that too. Hagrid, the last thing I wish to be is indelicate... ...but Acromantular venom is uncommonly rare. Would you allow me to extract a vial or two? Purely for academic purposes, you understand. Well, I don't suppose it's going to do him much good now, is it? My thoughts exactly. Always have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occasions as this. Old Potions Master's habit, you know. I wish you could've seen him in his prime. Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent. Oh, dear. - Would you like me to say a few words? - Yes. He had a family, I trust? Oh, yeah. Farewell... Aragog. Farewell, Aragog... ...king of the arachnids. Your body will decay... ...but your spirit lingers on. And your human friends find solace in the loss they have sustained. I had him from an egg, you know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. No bigger than a Pekinese. A Pekinese, mind you. How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. He was very dear to me. One afternoon I came downstairs, and he'd vanished. Poof. - That's very odd, isn't it? - It is, isn't it? But that's life, I suppose. You go along and then suddenly, poof! - Poof. - Poof. It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl on my desk... ...with just a few inches of clear water in it. And floating on the surface was a flower petal. As I watched, it sank. Just before it reached the bottom... ...it transformed... ...into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic. Wondrous to behold. The flower petal had come from a lily. Your mother. The day I came downstairs... ...the day the bowl was empty... ...was the day your mother... I know why you're here. But I can't help you. It would ruin me. Do you know why I survived, professor? The night I got this? Because of her. Because she sacrificed herself. Because she refused to step aside. Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort. - Don't say his name. - I'm not afraid of the name, professor. I'm going to tell you something. Something others have only guessed at. It's true. I am the Chosen One. Only I can destroy him, but in order to do so... ...I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you years ago in your office... ...and I need to know what you told him. Be brave, professor. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise, you disgrace her. Otherwise, she died for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl will remain empty forever. Please, don't think badly of me when you see it. You've no idea what he was like, even then. I was in the library the other night... ...in the Restricted Section... ...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic. It's called, as I understand it... ...a Horcrux. - I beg your pardon? - Horcrux. I came across the term while reading... ...and I didn't fully understand it. I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom... ...but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed. Which is... ...why I came to you. A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul. But I don't understand how that works, sir. One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you're protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed. Protected? That part of your soul that is hidden lives on. In other words, you cannot die. And how does one split his soul, sir? I think you already know the answer to that, Tom. Murder. Yes. Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature. Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven...? Seven? Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person? To rip the soul into seven pieces... This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic? Of course, sir. It'll be our little secret. Sir. This is beyond anything I imagined. You mean to say he succeeded, sir, in making a Horcrux? Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right. And not just once. What are they exactly? Could be anything. Most commonplace of objects. A ring, for example. Or a book. - Tom Riddle's diary. - It's a Horcrux, yes. Four years ago, when you saved Ginny's life... ...in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this. I knew this was a different kind of magic. Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight I had no idea just how powerful. - The ring? - Belonged to Voldemort's mother. Difficult to find. Even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux... One destroys Voldemort. But how would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere. True. But magic, especially dark magic... ...leaves traces. It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir? - When you leave the school? - Yes. And I think perhaps I may have found another. But this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone. Once again, I must ask too much of you, Harry. Have you ever considered that you ask too much... ...that you take too much for granted? Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore? Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant. I will not negotiate with you, Severus. You agreed. Nothing more to discuss. Oh, Harry. You need a shave, my friend. You know, at times, I forget how much you've grown. At times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I'm an old man. You still look the same to me, sir. Just like your mother, you're unfailingly kind. A trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid. The place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous. I promised you could accompany me, and I stand by that promise. But there is one condition: You must obey every command I give you, without question. Yes, sir. You do understand what I'm saying? Should I tell you to hide, you hide. Should I tell you to run, you run. Should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so. Your word, Harry. My word. Take my arm. Sir, I thought you couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts. Well, being me has its privileges. This is the place. Oh, yes. This place has known magic. - Sir! - In order to gain passage... ...payment must be made. Payment intended to weaken any intruder. - You should've let me, sir. - No, Harry. Your blood's much more precious than mine. Voldemort will not have made it easy to discover his hiding place. He will have put certain defenses in position. Careful. There it is. The only question is, how do we get there? If you would, Harry. Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir? Oh, yes. It has to be drunk. All of it has to be drunk. You remember the conditions on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me. Might make me forget why I'm here. Might cause me so much pain that I beg for relief. You are not to indulge these requests. It's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion. Even if you have to force it down my throat. - Understood? - Why can't I drink it, sir? Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry. Professor. Professor! Harry. Professor, can you hear me? Professor. No. Don't. You have to keep drinking, like you said. Remember? - Stop. - It will stop. It will stop... ...but only if you keep drinking. - Please, don't make me. - I'm sorry, sir. - Please. - Kill me. Kill me! - No! It's my fault. It's all my fault. It's my fault. Just one more, sir. One more, and then I promise... ...I promise I'll do what you say. - I promise. - No. Please. Harry. Water. Water. Water. You did it, sir. Look. Harry. Water. Aguamenti. Water. Lumos. Lumos Maxima! Harry. Sectumsempra! Harry. - Stupefy! - Harry. Harry. Partis Temporus! Go to your houses. No dawdling. We need to get you to the hospital wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey. No. Severus. Severus is who I need. Wake him. Tell him what happened. Speak to no one else. Severus, Harry. Hide yourself below, Harry. Don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission. Whatever happens, it's imperative you stay below. Harry, do as I say. Trust me. Trust me. Good evening, Draco. What brings you here on this fine spring evening? Who else is here? I heard you talking. I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful. Have you been whispering to yourself, Draco? Draco... ...you are no assassin. - How do you know what I am? I've done things that would shock you. Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me? Replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison? Forgive me, Draco. I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak... ...your heart can't really have been in them. He trusts me. I was chosen. Then I shall make it easy for you. Expelliarmus! Very good. Very good. You're not alone. There are others. How? The vanishing cabinet in the Room of Requirement. - I've been mending it. - Let me guess. It has a sister. A twin. In Borgin and Burkes. They form a passage. Ingenious. Draco... ...years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. - Please let me help you. - I don't want your help! Don't you understand? I have to do this. I have to kill you. Or he's gonna kill me. Well, look what we have here. Well done, Draco. Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order, don't you? Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're all on a bit of a tight schedule. Do it. He doesn't have the stomach, just like his father. Let me finish him in my own way. No! The Dark Lord was clear, the boy is to do it. This is your moment. Do it. Go on, Draco. Now! No. Severus. Please. Avada Kedavra. Yeah! Hagrid! Hello? Snape! He trusted you! Go on. Incarcerous. Fight back! You coward, fight back! No! He belongs to the Dark Lord. Sectumsempra! You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? Yes. I'm the Half-Blood Prince. McGONAGALL: Potter... ...in light of what has happened... ...if you should have the need to talk to someone... You should know, Professor Dumbledore... ...you meant a great deal to him. Do you think he would've done it? Draco? No. No, he was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always Snape. And I did nothing. It's fake. Open it. ""To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this... ...but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match... ...you will be mortal once more. R.A.B."" R.A.B. Don't know. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. Which means it was all a waste. All of it. Ron's okay with it, you know. You and Ginny. But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum. I'm not coming back, Hermione. I've got to finish whatever Dumbledore started. And I don't know where that'll lead me... ...but I'll let you and Ron know where I am when I can. I've always admired your courage, Harry. But sometimes, you can be really thick. You don't really think you're going to be able... ...to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry. I never realized how beautiful this place was., I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. - Besides, if Uncle Vernon... - Harry Potter! Now you've done it. He's in there. Vernon? I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go. But she's bored. If I could only let her out for an hour or two. So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir. But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends. Not one... ...all summer. Who would want to be friends with you? I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table... ...even let you have Dudley's second bedroom... ...purely out of the goodness of our hearts. Not now. It's for when the Masons arrive. Which should be any minute. Now, let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia, when the Masons arrive, you will be...? In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home. - Good. And, Dudley, you will be...? - I'll be waiting to open the door. Excellent. And you? I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist. Too right, you will. With any luck, this could be the day I make the biggest deal of my career... ...and you will not mess it up. Harry Potter, such an honor it is. - Who are you? - Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf. Not to be rude or anything... ...but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom. Yes, sir. Dobby understands. It's just that Dobby has come to tell you... It is difficult, sir. Dobby wonders where to begin. - Why don't you sit down? - Sit down? Sit down? Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything. Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir... ...but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal. You can't have met many decent wizards then. No, I haven't. That was an awful thing to say. - Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby! - Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush. Dobby, please, stop. Don't mind that. It's just the cat. - Bad Dobby. - Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet. Are you all right? Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. - Your family? - The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here... But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him. Harry Potter must not go back... ...to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year. There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen. What terrible things? Who's plotting them? Can't say. - Okay, I understand. You can't say. - Don't make me talk. I... - Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down. - Bad Dobby. So when they arrive at the ninth hole... Give me the lamp. Dobby, stop! - Let me go. - Get in there and keep quiet. - What the devil are you doing up here? - I was just... You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. Sorry. One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy. - And fix that door. - Yes, sir. See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. - It's the only place I've got friends. - Friends who don't write to Harry Potter? Well, I expect they've been... Hang on. How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me? Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him... ...Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir. - Give me those. Now. - No! Dobby, get back here. Dobby, please, no. Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school. I can't. Hogwarts is my home. Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good. It spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this building. One plumber said, ""Look at all that water."" The second plumber said, ""Yes, and that's just the top of it."" I'm so sorry. It's my nephew. He's very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs. You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never! Hiya, Harry. Ron. Fred. George. What are you all doing here? Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on, get your trunk. You better stand back. Let's go. - What was that? - What was it? Potter! Dad, what's going on? Go. Go. Go. Dad, hurry up. - Come on. - Come on, Harry, hurry up. Petunia, he's escaping! - I've got you, Harry. - Come here! - Let go of me! - No, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere. - Get off! - Drive! - Right. - Right! No! No! No! No! Dad! Damn. By the way, Harry, happy birthday. Come on. Okay, come on. Okay, come on. - Think it'd be all right if we had some? - Yeah, Mum will never know. It's not much, but it's home. I think it's brilliant. Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you, dear. Beds empty. No note. Car gone. You could have died. You could have been seen. Of course, I don't blame you, Harry, dear. They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window. Well, you best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley. Come on, Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in. That's it. There we go. - Mummy, have you seen my jumper? - Yes, dear, it was on the cat. Hello. What did I do? Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying, really. - Morning, Weasleys. - Morning, Dad. - What a night. Nine raids. Nine! - Raids? Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating. Well, now. And who are you? Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir. Harry Potter. Good Lord. Are you really? Well, Ron has told us all about you, of course. When did he get here? This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night. Did you really? How did it go? I mean... That was very wrong indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck? Well, that'll be Errol with the post. Fetch it, will you, Percy, please? - Errol. - He's always doing that. Look, it's our Hogwarts letters. They've sent us Harry's as well. Dumbledore must know you're here. Doesn't miss a trick, that man. - No. - This lot won't come cheap. - The spell books alone are expensive. - We'll manage. There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley. Right. Here we are, Harry. You go first, dear. But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum. Floo powder? You go first, Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go. That's it. Diagon Alley. You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it. Mind your head. That's right. Now, take your Floo powder. That's it, very good. Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly. Diagonally. - What did he say, dear? - Diagonally. I thought he did. - Not lost, are you, my dear? - I'm fine, thank you. I was just going... Come with us. We'll help you find your way back. - No. Please... - Harry? Hagrid! What do you think you're doing down here? Come on. You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place. Don't want no one to see you there. People will think you're up to no good. I was lost, I... Hang on. What were you doing down there then? Me? I was... I was looking for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent. They're ruining all the school cabbages. Harry. Hagrid. Hello, Hermione. - It's so good to see you. - It's great to see you too. What did you do to your glasses? Oculus Reparo. I definitely need to remember that one. You'll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it. - Okay, bye. - Thank you. Bye. Come on, everyone's been so worried. Harry. Thank goodness. We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart. Here he is. Mum fancies him. Make way there, please. Let me by, madam. Thank you. Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet. It can't be. Harry Potter? Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam. Nice big smile, Harry. Together, you and I rate the front page. Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning... ...to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me... ...which, incidentally, is currently celebrating... ...its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list... ...he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving... ...with my entire collected works... ...free of charge. Now, ladies? Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it. I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a bookshop without making the front page. Leave him alone. Look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend. Now, now, Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter. Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me. Your scar is legend. As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you. Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer. You must be very brave to mention his name. Or very foolish. Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. And you must be Miss Granger. Yes, Draco has told me all about you. And your parents. Muggles, aren't they? Let me see. Red hair, vacant expressions... ...tatty, secondhand book. You must be the Weasleys. It's mad in here. Let's go outside. - Well, well, well. Weasley senior. - Lucius. Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime... ...but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard... ...if they don't even pay you well for it? We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy. Clearly. Associating with Muggles. And I thought your family could sink no lower. I'll see you at work. See you at school. - 10:58, come on. - The train will be leaving any moment. Fred, George, Percy, you first. Okay. After you, dear. Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry. Let's go. - What do you two think you're doing? - Sorry. Lost control of the trolley. - Why can't we get through? - I don't know. The gateway has sealed itself for some reason. The train leaves at exactly 11:00. We've missed it. Harry, if we can't get through... ...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back. Maybe we should just go and wait by the car. The car. Ron, I should tell you... ...most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car. Right. Okay. Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty. Come on, then. Let's go lower. We need to find the train. Okay. All we need to do is catch up with the train. We can't be far behind. - Do you hear that? - We must be getting close. Hold on. Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on! I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty. - I think we found the train. - Yeah. Welcome home. Up! Up! It's not working! Up! Ron, mind that tree! Stop! Stop! Stop! - My wand. Look at my wand. - Be thankful it's not your neck. - What's happening? - I don't know. Come on, go! Fast! Scabbers, you're okay. The car! Dad's gonna kill me. See you, Hedwig. So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom... ...we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4... ...we almost get killed by a tree... Clearly someone doesn't want me here this year. Well, take a good look, lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. Oh, dear, we are in trouble. You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow... ...that's been on these grounds since before you were born. Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us. Silence. I assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me... ...the both of you would be on the train home tonight. - As it is... - They are not. Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall. Headmaster... ...these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. - As such... - I am well aware of our bylaws... ...having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house... ...it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action. We'll go and get our stuff, then. What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley? You're going to expel us, aren't you? Not today, Mr. Weasley... ...but I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention. Morning, everyone. - Good morning, everyone. - Good morning, Professor Sprout. Welcome to Greenhouse Three, second years. Gather around, everyone. Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger? Mandrake, or Mandragora... ...is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it. Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor. As our Mandrakes are still only seedlings... ...their cries won't kill you yet. But they could knock you out for hours, which is why I have given you earmuffs... ...for auditory protection. So could you please put them on, right away? Quickly. Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly. You pull it sharply up out of the pot. Got it? And... ...now you dunk it down into the other pot... ...and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm. Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs. - No, ma'am, he's just fainted. - Yes, well, just leave him there. Right, on we go. Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up. - There's Nearly Headless Nick. - Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater. Hello, Sir Nicholas. Say it. I'm doomed. - You're doomed. - Hi, Harry. I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too. Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you. Ron, is that your owl? Bloody bird's a menace. Oh, no. Look, everyone. Weasley's got himself a Howler. Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible. Ronald Weasley! How dare you steal that car! I am absolutely disgusted! Your father's now facing an inquiry at work... ...and it's entirely your fault! If you put another toe out of line... ...we'll bring you straight home! And, Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud. Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Me. Gilderoy Lockhart... ...Order of Merlin, Third Class... ...honorary member of the Dark Force Defense League... ...and five times winner... ...of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award. But I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him. Now, be warned. It is my job to arm you... ...against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. I must ask you not to scream. It might provoke them. Cornish pixies? Freshly caught Cornish pixies. Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan... ...but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters. Let's see what you make of them. Come on now, round them up. They're only pixies. - You just stay there! - Please, get me down! - Get off me! - Stop. Hold still! Peskipiksi Pesternomi! I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage. What do we do now? Immobulus! Why is it always me? I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We're gonna train earlier, harder and longer. What...? I don't believe it. - Where you think you're going, Flint? - Quidditch practice. - I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today. - Easy, Wood. I've got a note. I smell trouble. ""I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team... ...permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker."" You've got a new Seeker. Who? - Malfoy? - That's right. And that's not all that's new this year. Those are Nimbus 2001 s. How did you get those? A gift from Draco's father. You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best. At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent. No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood. You'll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs! You okay, Ron? Say something. - Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry? - No, Colin, get out of the way. Let's take him to Hagrid's. He'll know what to do. This calls for a specialist's equipment. Nothing to do but wait till it stops, I'm afraid. - Okay. - Better out than in. - Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway? - Malfoy. He called Hermione... Well, I don't know exactly what it means. He called me a Mudblood. - He did not. - What's a Mudblood? It means ""dirty blood."" Mudblood's a foul name for someone who's Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation. See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like the Malfoy family... ...who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood. That's horrible. It's disgusting. And it's codswallop to boot. Dirty blood. Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half-blood or less. More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can't do. Come here. Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute. Harry, Harry, Harry. Can you possibly imagine... ...a better way to serve detention... ...than by helping me to answer my fan mail? Not really. Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that. Come. Come... ...to me. - What? - Sorry? That voice. Voice? - Didn't you hear it? - What are you talking about, Harry? I think you're getting a bit drowsy. And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the time. We've been here nearly four hours. Spooky how the time flies when one is having fun. Spooky. Blood. I smell blood. Let me rip you. Let me kill you. Kill! Kill! - Kill! - Harry! - Did you hear it? - Hear what? - That voice. - Voice? What voice? I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just... It's time. It's moving. I think it's going to kill. - Kill? - Harry, wait! Not so fast! Strange. - I've never seen spiders act like that. - I don't like spiders. What's that? ""The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware."" It's written in blood. Oh, no. It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris. ""Enemies of the Heir, beware."" You'll be next, Mudbloods. What's going on here? Go on. Make way, make way. Potter? What are you...? Mrs. Norris? - You've murdered my cat. - No. No. I'll kill you. - I'll kill you! - Argus! Argus, I... Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except... ...you three. Ravenclaws, follow me. She's not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified. Thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her. But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say. Ask him. It's him that's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall. It's not true, sir. I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris. - Rubbish. - If I might, headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. However... ...the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner. I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail. That's why Ron and I went looking for him, professor. We'd just found him when he said... - Yes, Miss Granger? - When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris. - Innocent until proven guilty, Severus. - My cat has been Petrified. - I want to see some punishment! - We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime... ...I strongly recommend caution... ...to all. - It's a bit strange, isn't it? - Strange? You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear... ...and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange. Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean? Are you mad? No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign. She's right, you know. Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals... ...into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three. Vera Verto. Now it's your turn. Who would like to go first? Mr. Weasley. ""One, two, three. Vera Verto."" Vera Verto! That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. - Yes, Miss Granger? - Professor... ...I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets. Very well. You all know, of course... ...that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago... ...by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff... ...Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. - One did not. - Three guesses who. Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective... ...about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, pure-bloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend... ...Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle... ...known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it... ...until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school. The Heir alone... ...would be able to open the Chamber... ...and unleash the horror within, and by so doing... ...purge the school of all those who... ...in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic. Muggle-borns. Naturally, the school has been searched many times. No such chamber has been found. Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber? The Chamber is said to be home to something... ...that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home... ...of a monster. Do you think it's true? Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets? Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are. If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means... The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it? Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum? - If you're talking about Malfoy... - Of course. You heard him. ""You'll be next, Mudbloods."" I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin? Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries. Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling. Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules... ...and it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous. Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion. ""Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker... ...to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another."" You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle? - Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything. - Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion. - How long will it take to make? - A month. A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin... ...he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then. I know. But it's the only plan we've got. Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30. Yeah! Yeah! All right there, Scarhead? Watch yourself, Harry! Wood, look out! Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger. That's been tampered with, that has. I'll stop it. No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry. Training for the ballet, Potter? You'll never catch me, Potter. Let's go. Harry Potter has caught the Snitch. Gryffindor wins! Finite Incantatem! - Thank you. - Are you okay? No. I think my arm is broken. Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straightaway. - Not you. - Boy doesn't know what he's saying. This won't hurt a bit. Brackium Emendo! Yes, well, that can sometimes happen... ...but the point is... ...you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken. Broken? There's no bones left. Much more flexible, though. Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss. You can go. Out of my way. Should have been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back... You will be able to, won't you? I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business. What do you expect? Pumpkin juice? Kill. Kill. Time to kill. Hello. Dobby? Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby. Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train. It was you. You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through. Indeed. Yes, sir. - You nearly got Ron and me expelled. - At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home. Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see... Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me? Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands. You better clear off before my bones come back, or I might strangle you. Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home. I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me? Not kill you, sir. Never kill you. Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed... ...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin. Why do you wear that thing, Dobby? This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elf's enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here... ...now that history is to repeat itself. Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before? I shouldn't have said that. - Bad Dobby! Bad! - Stop it! Stop it, Dobby! Tell me. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now? Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe. No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it? Put him here. - What happened? - There's been another attack. I think he's been Petrified, Madam Pomfrey. Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker. What can this mean, Albus? It means... ...that our students are in great danger. - What should I tell the staff? - The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again. Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before? Of course. Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. - Now he's taught Draco how to do it. - Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure. Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight... ...in the middle of the girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught? No. No one ever comes in here. - Why? - Moaning Myrtle. Who? Moaning Myrtle. - Who's Moaning Myrtle? - I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't expect you to know me. Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable... ...moping Moaning Myrtle? She's a little sensitive. Gather round! Gather round. Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent. In light of the dark events of recent weeks... ...Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club... ...to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves... ...as I myself have done on countless occasions. For full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant... ...Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration. I don't want any of you youngsters to worry. You'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him. Never fear. One. Two. - Three! - Expelliarmus! - Do you think he's all right? - Who cares? An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape... ...but if you don't mind me saying, it was obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy. Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students... ...to block unfriendly spells, professor. An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape. Let's have a volunteer pair. Potter, Weasley, how about you? Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps? - Good luck, Potter. - Thank you, sir. Wands at the ready. - Scared, Potter? - You wish. On the count of three... ...cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm. We don't want any accidents here. One. - Two. - Everte Statum! Rictusempra! I said disarm only. Serpensortia! Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you. Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte Ascendare! Vipera Evanesca. What are you playing at? You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us? - I'm a what? - You can talk to snakes. I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it. No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad. What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin... - That's what you said to it. - You were there. You heard me. I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language. I spoke a different language? But I didn't realize... How can I speak a language without knowing I can? I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too. Exactly. Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson. But I'm not. I can't be. He lived a thousand years ago. For all we know, you could be. I'll see you back in the common room. I want blood. They all must die. Kill. Kill. Kill. Time to kill. Caught in the act. I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words. No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand... Professor... ...I swear I didn't. This is out of my hands, Potter. Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet Lemon. Professor Dumbledore? Bee in your bonnet, Potter? I was just wondering if you put me in the right house. Yes. You were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said last year. You would have done well in Slytherin. You're wrong. Harry? Professor. Your bird... There was nothing I could do. - He just caught fire. - And about time too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die... ...and then they are... ...reborn from the ashes. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads. Their tears have healing powers. Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry. I'd be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic. Relax. I do not believe... ...that Harry attacked anyone. - Of course you don't. Right. Well, I'll... - I'll just wait outside, then. - Yes. - You don't think it was me, professor? - No, Harry. I do not think it was you. But I must ask you... ...is there something you wish to tell me? No, sir. Nothing. Very well, then. Off you go. Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into. Crabbe and Goyle. We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle... ...can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy. - How? - I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep... ...hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs... ...and put on their uniforms. - Whose hair are you ripping out, then? - I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin. I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these. Ron, maybe I should do it. Yeah. Right. Wingardium Leviosa. Cool. How thick could you get? Come on, let's get them. We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves. Add the hairs. Essence of Crabbe. Cheers. I think I'm gonna be sick. Me too. Harry? Ron. Bloody hell! We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe. - Bloody hell. - Excellent. - But where's Hermione? - I... I don't think I'm going. You go on without me. Hermione, are you okay? Just go. You're wasting time. Come on. I think the Slytherin common room's this way. Excuse me. What are you doing d...? I mean, what are you doing down here? I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night. What are your names again? - I'm... - Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses? - Reading. - Reading? I didn't know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley? Mind your attitude, Malfoy. Well, sit down. You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What's wrong with you, Crabbe? Stomachache. I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing... ...that ever happened to this place. - You're wrong! What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore? Well? Do you? Harry Potter? Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin? But then you must have some idea who's behind it all. You know I don't, Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this: It's been 50 years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it. Only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me... ...I hope it's Granger. What's the matter with you two? You're acting very odd. It's his stomachache. Calm down. Scar. Hair. Hey! Where are you going? That was close. Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you. Go away. Wait till you see. It's awful. Hermione? Are you okay? Do you remember me telling you... ...that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face. Look at your tail. Have you spoken to Hermione? She should be out of hospital in a few days... ...when she stops coughing up fur balls. What's this? Yuck! Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom. - Come to throw something else at me? - Why would I throw something at you? Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business... ...and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me. But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'll just go right through you. Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it. Ten points if you get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head! - But who threw it at you, anyway? - I don't know. I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death... ...and it fell through the top of my head. ""Tom Marvolo Riddle."" My name... ...is Harry... ...Potter. Do you know anything... ...about the Chamber of Secrets? Can you... ...tell me? Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here? Are you Tom Riddle? Hello, can you hear me? Riddle! Come. Professor Dumbledore. Dumbledore? It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom. Yes, professor. I suppose I... I had to see for myself if the rumors were true. I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true. About the school as well? I don't have a home to go to. They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, professor? I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid... ...Headmaster Dippet may have no choice. Sir, if it all stopped, if the person responsible was caught... Is there something... ...you wish to tell me? No, sir. Nothing. Very well, then. Off you go. Good night, sir. - Let's get you out of there. - Evening, Hagrid. I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone... You can't. You don't understand. The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do... ...is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered. It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one. Never. Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. - Now, stand aside. - No! - Stand aside, Hagrid. - No! Cistem Aperio! Arania Exumai! Aragog! Aragog! I can't let you go. They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled. Hagrid! It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago. It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be. We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch. The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done? Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it? That would be a cheerful visit. ""Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"" Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now, would you? No. What's that you've got, Hagrid? It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, you know. Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit of growing to do. But once their acne's cleared up, we'll chop them up and stew them... ...and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three... ...had best be looking after yourselves. All right? Hello, Neville. Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come. Come on! It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password. Unless it wasn't a student. Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something. And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone. All right, listen up. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter. Not to mention they're dead scared that Harry will Petrify them... ...if they fly anywhere near him. - Well, that too. Professor McGonagall. - This match has been canceled. - We can't cancel Quidditch. Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see. I warn you. This could be a wee bit of a shock. Hermione! She was found near the library... ...along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you? No. Could I have your attention, please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately: ""All students will return to their house common rooms by 6:00 every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions."" I should tell you this: Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught... ...it is likely the school will be closed. We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him... ...but if he did set the monster loose last time... ...he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start. But you heard McGonagall. We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class. I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again. Who's there? Hello? Hello? - What's that for? - Nothing. I was expecting... It doesn't matter. Come on in. I just made a pot of tea. Hagrid, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm all right. Did you hear about Hermione? Yeah. I heard about that, all right. Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets? What you had to understand about that is... Quick, under the cloak. Don't say a word. Be quiet, both of you. - Professor Dumbledore, sir. - Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we...? Of course. Come in. Come in. That's Dad's boss. Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic. Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business. Had to come. Three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. - The Ministry's got to act. - But I never... You know I never, professor. I want it understood, Cornelius... ...that Hagrid... ...has my full confidence. Albus, look, Hagrid's record is against him. - I've got to take him. - Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban prison. I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid. Already here, Fudge? Good. What are you doing here? Get out of my house! Believe me... ...I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your... You call this a house? No. I simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here. Well, what exactly is it that you want with me? The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You'll find all 12 signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks... ...there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school. You can't take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance. You mark my words, there'll be killings next! You think so? Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal... ...I will, of course, step aside. However... ...you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts... ...to those who... ...ask for it. Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge. Come, Hagrid. Well? If... If anybody was looking for some stuff... ...then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yep. That would lead them right. That's all I have to say. And someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away. Good boy. Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day. Look. Come on. Come on, Fang. Come on. What? You heard what Hagrid said. ""Follow the spiders."" They're heading to the Dark Forest. Why spiders? Why couldn't it be ""follow the butterflies""? Harry, I don't like this. - Harry, I don't like this at all. - Shush! Can we go back now? Come on. Who is it? Don't panic. Hagrid? Is that you? We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? You're Aragog, aren't you? Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before. He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before. That's a lie. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. - Then you're not the monster? - No. The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler. Harry. But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago? We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. But have you seen it? I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here. - Harry! - What? Well, thank you. We'll just go. Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat... ...when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Goodbye, friend of Hagrid. Can we panic now? Know any spells? One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them. Where's Hermione when you need her? Let's go! Arania Exumai! Go! Glad we're out of there. Arania Exumai! - Thanks for that. - Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on, move faster! Come on! Go! Get us in the air. The flying gear's jammed! - Come on! Pull! - I'm trying! Follow the spiders. Follow the spiders. If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him. I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? - What have we found out? - We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent. Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever. - What's that? - Ron... This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked. Come on. ""Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land... ...none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years... ...instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it."" Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake. But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead? Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it. But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again. And Hermione had the mirror. I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along. And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry. The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. ""Spiders flee before it."" - It all fits. - How's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty, great snake. Someone would have seen it. - Hermione's answered that too. - Pipes? It's using the plumbing. Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left? Moaning Myrtle. All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately. As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts. So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed? A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last. - My moment? - Weren't you saying just last night... ...that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is? That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. - Your skills, after all, are legend. - Very well. I'll just be in my office getting... Getting ready. Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva? Ginny Weasley. ""Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever."" Ginny. Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know. Professor, we have some information for you. Are you going somewhere? Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable. Got to go. - What about my sister? - Well... As to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I. You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. You can't go now. I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the description... You're running away? - After all you did in your books? - Books can be misleading. - You wrote them. - My dear boy, use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold as well if people didn't think I'd done those things. You're a fraud. You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done. Is there anything you can do? Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. I'd never have sold another book. In fact, I'm going to have to do the same to you. Don't even think about it. Who's there? Hello, Harry. - What do you want? - To ask you how you died. It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. - Who was it, Myrtle? - I don't know. I was distraught! But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language. And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and... ...I died. - Just like that? How? I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes... ...over there by that sink. This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue. Excellent, Harry. Good work. Well, then, I'll just be... There's no need for me to stay. Yes, there is. - You first. - Now, boys, what good will it do? Better you than us. But... Obviously, yes. Sure you don't want to test it first? It's really quite filthy down here. - All right. Let's go. - Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. Thanks, Myrtle. Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway. Go on. This way. - What's this? - It looks like a snake. - It's a snakeskin. - Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be 60 feet long. Or more. Heart of a lion, this one. The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds... ...at the sight of her mangled body. So... You first, Mr. Potter. Say goodbye to your memories. Obliviate! - Ron! Ron, are you okay? - I'm fine. Hello. Who are you? - Ron Weasley. - Really? And who am I? Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is. It's an odd sort of place, isn't it? Do you live here? - No. - Really? - What do I do now? - You wait here... ...and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. - I'll go on and find Ginny. - Okay. Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up, wake up. Please wake up. She won't wake. Tom. Tom Riddle. What do you mean, she won't wake? - She's not...? - She's still alive, but only just. - Are you a ghost? - A memory... ...preserved in a diary for 50 years. She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk. It won't come until it's called. - Give me my wand, Tom. - You won't be needing it. - We've got to go. We've got to save her. - I'm afraid I can't do that. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets. No. She couldn't. She wouldn't. It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat... ...Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls. - But why? - Because I told her to. You'll find I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. She tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. And then who should find it but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet. And why did you want to meet me? I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid... ...to gain your trust. - Hagrid's my friend. - And you framed him, didn't you? - It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent. I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you. He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was at school... ...so I decided to leave behind a diary... ...preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages... ...so that one day I would be able to lead another... ...to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work. Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready. And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again. Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target has been you. How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent... ...was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar... ...while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed? Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time. Voldemort is my past, present and future. You. You're the Heir of Slytherin. - You're Voldemort. - Surely you didn't think... ...I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere... ...would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world. Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world. Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me. He'll never be gone. Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him. Fawkes? So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender. A songbird and an old hat. Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin... ...against the famous Harry Potter. Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me. No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you. Yes, Potter. The process is nearly complete. In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return... ...very much alive. Ginny? Remarkable, isn't it... ...how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do... ...especially in the hands of a silly little girl. What are you doing? Stop. No! It was me. But I swear, I didn't mean to. Riddle made me, and... Harry, you're hurt. Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough. Of course. Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks. It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory. Amazing! This is just like magic! You both realize, of course... ...that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules. Yes, sir. There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled. Yes, sir. Therefore, it is only fitting... ...that you both receive... ...Special Awards for Services to the School. Thanks, sir. Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would... ...have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban. I believe we want our gamekeeper back. First, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And... ...second... ...I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry? It's just... You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain... Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me. I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry... ...he transferred some of his powers to you... ...the night he gave you that scar. Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me? Not intentionally... ...but yes. So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be in Slytherin. It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness... ...and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor? - Because I asked it to. - Exactly, Harry. Exactly. Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor... ...then I suggest you look more closely at this. Be careful. Godric Gryffindor. It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat. Dobby. So this is your master. The family you serve is the Malfoys. I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter. So it's true. You have returned. When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter... ...was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. - Ridiculous. - Curiously, Lucius, several of them... ...were under the impression that you would curse their family... ...if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place. - How dare you! - Beg your pardon? My sole concern has always been and will always be... ...the welfare of this school... ...and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume? Yes. And? Who was it? Voldemort. Only this time he chose to act through somebody else... ...by means of this. I see. Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things... ...should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be... ...severe. Well, let us hope... ...that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day. Don't worry. I will be. Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We're leaving. Sir? I wonder if I could have that? Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours. Mine? I don't know what you're talking about. I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron... ...that day at Diagon Alley. You do, do you? Why don't you prove it? Come, Dobby. Open it. Dobby. Master has given Dobby a sock. What? I didn't give... Master has presented Dobby with clothes. Dobby is free. You lost me my servant! You shall not harm Harry Potter. Your parents were meddlesome fools too. Mark my words, Potter. One day soon... ...you are going to meet the same sticky end. Harry Potter freed Dobby. How can Dobby ever repay him? - Just promise me something. - Anything, sir. Never try to save my life again. - Welcome back, Sir Nicholas. - Thank you. - Good evening, Sir Nicholas. - Good evening. - Good to see you, Sir Nicholas. - Thank you. Hello. - Hermione! Welcome back. - Thanks, Sir Nicholas. Harry. It's Hermione. - Welcome back, Hermione. - It's good to be back. Congratulations. I can't believe you solved it. We had loads of help from you. - We couldn't have done it without you. - Thanks. Could I have your attention, please? Before we begin the feast... ...let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey... ...whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered... ...to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent events... ...as a school treat... ...all exams have been canceled. Oh, no. Sorry I'm late. The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron... ...and Hermione, of course... ...I would still be you-know-where... ...so I'd just like to say thanks. There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.,   HOLMES: Head cocked to the left... ...partial deafness in ear. First point of attack. Two, throat. Paralyze vocal cords. Stop screaming. Three, got to be heavy drinker. Floating rib to the liver. Four, finally, dragging left leg. Fist to patella. Summary of prognosis, conscious in 90 seconds. Martial efficacy, quarter of an hour. Full faculty recovery, unlikely.   I like the hat. I just picked it up. Did you remember your revolver? Knew I forgot something. - Thought I'd left the stove on. - You did. I think that's quite enough. You are a doctor, after all. Always nice to see you, Watson. Where's the inspector? He's getting his troops lined up. HOLMES: That could be all day. MAN: Sherlock Holmes. And his loyal dog. Tell me, doctor... ...as a medical man, have you enjoyed my work? Let me show you how much I've enjoyed it. HOLMES: Watson. Don't. Observe. How did you see that? Because I was looking for it.  WATSON: Lord Blackwood. You seem surprised. I'd say the girl deserves your attention more than he. Indeed. Oh, I'd leave that alone if I were you, boy-o. Good lad. Impeccable timing, Lestrade. We've one for the doctor... ...and one for the rope. - Clarkie? - Sir? This woman needs a hospital immediately. Put her in the back of the Moriah. POLICEMAN 1: Right, lads. That's it. POLICEMAN 2: Right. Pick him up, lads. POLICEMAN 3: Yes, sir. If you don't mind. Get him out of my sight. And you were supposed to wait for my orders. If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor. Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard. Why they thought you'd require any assistance is beyond me. Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief. Indeed. Congratulations, Lestrade. Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar. MAN: Gentlemen. Cheese.   MAN 1: Blackwood hangs tomorrow. Read all about it. WATSON: 156 over 80. Very good. MAN 2: My nerves are the best they've been in years, thanks to you. Tell me something. Your new premises... ...when are you moving in? I should be in within the week. Cavendish Place. And there'll be a woman's touch too. - Well, that's marvelous. - Indeed.  Good God. - That was gunfire. - No. No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it? My colleague's probably just putting up a painting. I'll... I'll go and check. - Your colleague... - Yes? Won't be moving with you, will he? No, he won't. Mrs. Hudson. I won't go in, not while he's got a gun in his hand. You don't have to. Give me the paper. What'll I do when you leave, doctor? He'll have the whole house down. He just needs another case. That's all. Couldn't you have a longer engagement? I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you know, not in a domestic environment.  Thank you, Captain Philips. Perhaps a nice cup of tea? - Same time next week. HUDSON: Come along, captain. - It's quieter downstairs. - Mrs. Hudson? Bring something to cheer him up. Permission to enter the armory? HOLMES: Granted. Watson, I am in the process of inventing a device... ...that suppresses the sound of a gunshot.  WATSON: It's not working. Can I see that?  You know, it's been three months... ...since your last case. HOLMES: Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson. Be gentle with me...  Don't you think it's time you found another one? I can't but agree. My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems. Give me work. The sooner, the better. Paper. Let's see, then. There's a letter here... ...from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park. - Her husband's disappeared. - He's in Belgium with the scullery maid. Is it November? Yes, Holmes. All right. Lady Radford reports... Oh, her emerald bracelet has disappeared. Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies. Oh. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging. Yes. It was our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end.   A Mr. Lewis is seeking... There's only one case that intrigues me at present: The curious case of Mrs. Hudson, the absentee landlady. I've been studying her comings and goings. They appear most sinister. Tea, Mr. Holmes? Is it poisoned, nanny? There's enough of that in you already. Don't touch. Everything is in its proper place... ...as per usual, nanny. He's killed the dog. Again. WATSON: What have you done to Gladstone now? I was simply testing a new anesthetic. He doesn't mind. Holmes, as your doctor... - He'll be as right as a trivet in no time. - As your friend... ...you've been in this room for two weeks. I insist, you have to get out. There's nothing of interest for me out there, on earth, at all. - You're free this evening? - Absolutely. - Dinner? The Royale? - Wonderful. My favorite. Mary's coming. - Not available. - You're meeting her, Holmes. Have you proposed yet? - No, I haven't found the right ring. - Then it's not official. It's happening, whether you like it or not. 8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket. You wear a jacket.  A man? Outside my house? Straighten your tie.  WATSON: Holmes. - Mm. You're early. Fashionably. Miss Mary Morstan. My goodness. What a pleasure. I don't know why it's taken him so long to introduce us properly. Pleasure is mine. It really is quite a thrill to meet you, Mr. Holmes. I've heard so much about you. I have a pile of detective novels at home. - Wilkie Collins, Poe. - It's true. It can seem a little far-fetched though sometimes... ...making grand assumptions out of tiny details. That's not quite right, is it? In fact, the little details are by far the most important. - Take Watson. - I intend to. See his walking stick? A rare African snakewood... ...hiding a blade of high-tensile steel. A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war... ...so I can assume he's a decorated soldier. Strong, brave, born to be a man of action. And neat, like all military men. Now, I check his pockets. Ah. A stub from a boxing match. Now I can infer that he's a bit of a gambler. I'd keep an eye on that dowry. - Those days are behind me. - Right behind you. He's cost us the rent more than once. Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes, you know John very well. What about a complete stranger? - What can you tell about me? - You? - I don't think... - I don't know that... - Not at dinner. - Some other time. - I insist. - You insist? - You remember we discussed this. - The lady insists. - You're a governess. - Well done. Yes, well done. Shall we? - Waiter? - Your student... ...is a boy of 8. - Charlie's 7, actually. HOLMES: Charlie, huh? Then he's tall for his age. He flicked ink at you today. Is there ink on my face? There's nothing wrong with your face. There are two drops on your ear, in fact. India blue's nearly impossible to wash off. A very impetuous act by the boy. But you're too experienced to react rashly... ...which is why the lady for whom you work lent you that. Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby. Hardly the gems of a governess. The jewels you are not wearing tell us more. - Holmes. - You were engaged. The ring is gone, but the lighter skin suggests... ...that you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly... ...until you were informed of its true, modest worth. You broke off the engagement... ...and returned to England for better prospects. A doctor, perhaps. Right on all counts, Mr. Holmes, apart from one. I didn't leave him. He died. Well done, old boy.  - Fight. Fight. - Get him. McMURDO: Get up and fight. Fight. - Finish it. McMURDO: Come on. Get up and fight, come on. Come on. Get up. MAN 1: Get up and fight. That's it, big man, we're done. You won, congratulations. We ain't done yet.  HOLMES: This mustn't register on an emotional level. First, distract target. Then block his blind jab. Counter with cross to left cheek. Discombobulate. Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker. Employ elbow block, and body shot. Block feral left. Weaken right jaw. Now fracture. Break cracked ribs. Traumatize so! Ar plexus. Dislocate jaw entirely. Heel kick to diaphragm. ! n summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured, three ribs cracked, four broken... ...diaphragm hemorrhaging, physical recovery, six weeks... ...full psychological recovery, six months... ...capacity to spit at back of head... ...neutralized.  MAN 2: Where did that come from?  MAN: What the hell's going on here, Charlie? Lord Blackwood's put him under some kind of spell, sir. It's like he's burning from the inside out. You lot, shut up! Charlie. Charlie! Take this man to the infirmary, now. What's this all about, then, Blackwood? There's someone I want to see.  - Watson? WATSON: Right. Let's go. What started merely as an experiment... ...has brought me to the threshold of a monumental discovery. Now, if I play a chromatic scale... ...there's no measurable response. You do know what you're drinking is meant for eye surgery? But, now... ...and this is remarkable... ...if I change to atonal clusters... ...voil, they fly in counterclockwise, synchronized concentric circles... ...as though a regimented flock. Watson, this is exceptional. I, using musical theory, have created order out of chaos. How did you lure them in? Excellent question. Individually. I've been at it for six hours. - And what happens if I do this? - What? - Right. - Clean yourself up. You are Blackwood's last request. Look at those towering structures. It's the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge ever attempted. Most innovative. What an industrious empire. Hm? Oh, I have your winnings from last night. You weren't there, so I made your customary bet. Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook, locked safely away in my drawer. Did you know the opera house is featuring Don Giovanni? I could procure a couple of tickets if you had any cultural inclinations this evening.  You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.  I knew she'd been engaged. She had told me. So that's no to the opera, then? - That was my waistcoat. - We agreed it's too small for you. - I'd like it back. - We agreed. I want it back.  This way, Mr. Holmes. Blackwood certainly seems to have got the crowd into something of a fear frenzy. Which I'm certain will disperse once his feet have stopped twitching. Care to come along? No, old cock. I've no business with him whilst he's alive. Suit yourself, mother hen. It seems you have lots of rooms to let. We had to move the prisoners, sir. Otherwise we were gonna have a riot. He has a peculiar effect on the inmates. As though... ...he can get inside their heads. I can find my own way if you have other duties to perform. Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir. BLACKWOOD: If any man have an ear, let him hear. I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up... ...having seven heads and 10 horns. Upon his heads were the name of blasphemy. They worshiped the dragon, which gave power. They worshiped, saying, ""Who is like unto the beast?"" The beast which I saw was like a leopard. His feet were of a bear, his mouth was of a lion... ...and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority. I love what you've done with the place. So glad you could accept my invitation. I just have a small point of concern. - How can I help? - I'd followed the murders with interest. While my heart went out to the families of the victims... ...I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush. - You're too kind. - However, by comparison... ...your work in the crypt was more akin to a finger painting. So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot. Either that or, um... ...shortly my friend will pronounce you dead and I thought I might keep him company. Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly's led to this moment. Your error of judgment is to assume that I'm holding the brush at all. - I'm merely the channel. - My only wish is that I caught you sooner. You see, five lives might have been spared. Mm. Those lives were a necessity. Hm. Sacrifice. Five meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose. I wonder if they'd let Watson and me dissect your brain. After you're hanged, of course. I'd wager there's some deformity that'd be scientifically significant. Then you, too, could serve a greater purpose. Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze. I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events. You and I are bound together on a journey... ...that will twist the very fabric of nature. But beneath your mask of logic, I sense a fragility. That worries me. Steel your mind, Holmes. I need you. You've come a long way down from the House of Lords. - And I will rise again. - Bon voyage. Pay attention. Three more will die, and there is nothing you can do to save them. You must accept that this is beyond your control... ...or, by the time you realize you made all of this possible... ...it'll be the last sane thought in your head. What did he want? Not sure. But I don't think you're needed, Father. Not for this one. MAN: Lord Henry Blackwood... ...you are sentenced to death for the practice of black magic... ...the unholy murder of five innocent young women... ...and the attempted murder of a sixth. Do you have any final words? Death... ...is only the beginning. PRIEST: - Forever and ever. Amen. That is the end of Lord Blackwood. ADLER: London's so bleak this time of year. Not that I'm pining for New Jersey. I much prefer to travel in the winter. Here, I brought you these, all the way from Syria. I found these exquisite dates in Jordan... ...and your favorite... ...olives from the Cyclades. Thought we might have a little tea party. And while I was setting the table, I found this: A file with my name on it. ""Theft of Velzquez portrait from king of Spain."" ""Missing naval documents lead to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."" ""Scandalous affair ends engagement of... ...Hapsburg prince to Romanov princess."" I was simply studying your methods... ...should the authorities ask me to hunt you down. Ah. But I don't see my name in any of these articles. But your signature was clear. Is that the maharajah's missing diamond? Or just another souvenir? Let's not dwell on the past. Shall we? By the looks of things, you're between jobs. And you between husbands. How much did you get for the ring? He was boring and jealous, and he snored. I'm Irene Adler again.  Thank you.  I need your help. I need you to find someone. Why are you always so suspicious? Shall I answer chronologically or alphabetically? Careful not to cut yourself on this lethal envelope. I think you'll find all the information you need inside. Who are you working for? So I'll have to find out the hard way? Keep your money. I didn't say I'll take the case. Well, consider it a wager that you will. Do you remember The Grand? They gave me our old room. Hold the door. Thanks, doctor. Ma'am. - He'll do it. MAN 1: Well done, Miss Adler. That's precisely why I hired you. I wager he'll have our man within the next 24 hours. MAN 1: He'd better. Reordan is the key to what Blackwood was doing. He's essential to my plan. MAN 2: Get off out of it. MAN 3: What you doing? Can't you see where you're going? - You scalp diver. - Get off out of it. A little rifle range would go a long way, sir... ...rubbing the calluses off these German bands. God save the queen. God save the queen, sir. MAN 2: Get off out of it. Look at you. Why is the only woman you've cared about a criminal? Are you a masochist? - Allow me to explain. - Allow me. She's the only adversary who ever outsmarted you. Twice. Made a proper idiot out of you. - Right, you've had your fun. - What's she after, anyway? - It's time to press on. - What could she possibly need? It doesn't matter. An alibi? A beard? A human canoe. She could sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames. That's of no consequence to you, is it? We've done our last case together. WATSON: I've already read it. Missing person: Luke Reordan, 4 foot 10, red hair, no front teeth. Case solved. You're obviously not her type. She likes ginger dwarves. - Midget. - So you agree? No, I don't agree. It's more than technicality, you see. You're misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened peoples. - I've said too much. I've upset you. - No, I am simply stating that one has... What were you doing? - Will you allow me to explain? - I wish you would. - Holmes. What are you doing? - Nothing. - Are you wearing a false...? - False nose? No. - Tell me that that wasn't... - That wasn't.  WATSON: Holmes. Where are you going?  HOLMES: Watson. Watson. Got some flowers for you, sweetheart. Cut you a deal because you're so pretty. Oh. My lucky day. Hello, gorgeous. You got something for me? Don't move. Now, what have we got here?  It's... Thank you. That's the Irene I know. WOMAN: Good boy. This man intrigues me, Watson. He's got Adler on edge. - Which is no mean feat. - She's intimidated. She's scared of him. Yet she works for him. - Right. - It's nothing to do with me... ...but I advise you leave the case alone. Well, I may not have a choice. After all, I may be paying the rent on my own soon, thanks to you. - Get that out of my face. - It's not. It's in my hand. Get what's in your hand out of my face. CLARK: Mr. Holmes? - Clarkie. Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me at once. What's he done now, lost his way to Scotland Yard? Watson, grab a compass. ""You"" means ""us."" No, ""you"" means you. CLARK: It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh... Well... ...it appears he's come back from the grave, sir. - Most engaging. - Very clever. I pronounced the man dead myself. What are the facts? Groundskeeper saw him walking through the graveyard this morning. I'll leave this in your capable hands. - I have an appointment with Mary. - It's not my reputation that's at stake here. Don't try that. - The newspapers got wind of it? - That's what we're trying to avoid. Certainly. What's the major concern? Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir. - Indeed. - You're not taking this seriously, are you? Yes, as you should. It's a matter of professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not. Who do you think won the match, Clarkie? - Sir? - The rugby match. Your boys have done a magnificent job obliterating any potential evidence. Yes. But at least they never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. LESTRADE: You took your time, Holmes. HOLMES: ""And on the third day""... These slabs are half a ton each if they're a pound... ...and they're smashed open from the inside. Lestrade, what of the coffin? - We are in the process of bringing it up. - I see. Hm. Right. At what stage of the process? Contemplative? Anyhow, where's our witness? He's over there. And apparently, he is cata... Cat... Catatonic, sir. - He's not feeling very well. - Yes. If you lot don't stop behaving like quivering milkmaids, you're on double-time. Now, you get down there and you bring that coffin up now. Good day, sir. Hello. It's all right. I'm a doctor. The man's in shock. He may need a few moments. The witness stated that he saw Lord Blackwood rise from the grave. Well? - Well? - You pronounced him dead. He had no pulse. MAN: Ready. Down. Good Lord. That's not Blackwood. Well, now we have a firm grasp of the obvious. Time of death? Diptera is... ...approximately... ...two thirds of an inch which would put the time of death... ...at between 10 and 12 hours ago. May I borrow your pen? - Adler's dwarf. - Midget. GROUNDSKEEPER: I know what I saw. It was Blackwood. As clear as I see you. And when the dead walk... ...the living will fill these coffins. Well, um...  LESTRADE: Right. Put the lid on and clean this lot up. WATSON: You really believe he was resurrected? HOLMES: The question is not if, but how. - The game's afoot. WATSON: Follow your spirit... HOLMES & WATSON: And upon this charge, cry: ""God for Harry, England and St. George."" There you are. Why that certain chips stall, I don't understand. There's a particular beer in their batter. A northern stout, to be exact. WATSON: You know, Holmes, I've seen things in war I don't understand. I once met a man who predicted his own death... ...right down to the number and the placement... ...of the bullets that killed him. You have to admit, Holmes... ...that a supernatural explanation to this case... ...is theoretically possible. Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake to theorize before one has data. Inevitably one begins to twist facts to suit theories... ...instead of theories to suit facts. That said, I believe Adler's midget is the key to this. WATSON: Hm. HOLMES: Right. Scratches around the keyhole where the watch was wound. - What does that tell you? - The man was likely a drunk. Every time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches. Very good, Watson. You've developed considerable deductive powers of your own. Hm. Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored... - Pawnbrokers' marks. - Excellent. Most recent of which are ""M.H."" M.H. M.H. Is for? - Maddison and Haig. - Maddison and Haig. They should be able to give us an address. What a coincidence. There's one thing you've failed to deduce from the watch. HOLMES: Really? I think not. WATSON: The time. I have to get back, Holmes. Taking tea with the in-laws. - Reckon your future, sir? - Absolutely not. WATSON: No, thank you. - You need to hear what I have to tell. We have no need of your lucky heather, gypsy woman. Even if it's to do with Mary? Oh. Oh. I see two men. Brothers. Not in blood, but in bond. What of Mary? M for Mary, for marriage. Oh, you will be married. Go on. I see patterned tablecloths... ...and, oh, china figurines... ...and, oh, lace doilies. Doilies. Lace doilies? Holmes. Does your depravity know no bounds? - No. - Oh, she turns to fat... ...and, oh, she has a beard and... - What of the warts? - She's covered in warts. - Enough. - Are they extensive? Please, enough. It's the most apt prediction Flora has made in years. And precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring. Do you have my money? You are terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre. - Do you have my cut from the fight? - Admit it. - Give me my money! Holmes. - Admit it! HOLMES: I see. Thank you. HOLMES: Well, you've got your ring and I've got my address for the ginger midget. - Should be just there. - I think she'll really like this. And I have some change in my pocket. - Shall I look after it for you? - No, no. - Don't give it away here. - No. I have to go see Mary. Give her my best. And her family, as well. It does make a considerable difference to me... ...having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Well, you can rely on me for exactly 10 minutes. He clearly felt something was coming to get him. HOLMES: Something did. Irene Adler was here. Either that or the ginger midget wore the same Parisian perfume.  Ah. Putrefaction.  Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas.  Phosphorous. Formaldehyde. It looks like... ...he was attempting to combine... ...some kind of sorcery and scientific formula. HOLMES: More importantly... ...let's see what he was trying to dispose of. - Potassium, magnesium. - Sultaphytic acid. It'll suck the iron right out of the ink as long as it's not too burnt. Peculiar. Hydrated rhododendron.  - Holmes. - Hm? Look at the crest. Reordan was working with Blackwood. Of course he was. The question is, to what end. Whatever he was working on, he clearly succeeded. How so? Otherwise, he'd still be alive. Which is why Miss Adler is so desperate to find him. HOLMES: Yes. There is one odor I can't quite put my finger on. - Mm? - Is it candy floss? Molasses? Maple syrup? Barley sugar. Toffee apple. Let me guess. Judging by your arsonist tool kit... ...you're here to burn down the building and extinguish all evidence therein. Just one minute, boys. Oh, Dredger.   Meat... ...or potatoes? My 10 minutes are up.   WATSON: You all right?   Holmes... ...what is that? DREDGER:    HOLMES: WATSON: Holmes!  Watson... ...what have you done? WATSON: I haven't slept all night. Not a wink. Why I ever believed... ...that I would get to have tea with Mary's parents is beyond me... ...having been talked into going with you. - We were set upon. It was self-defense. I've been reviewing my notes on our exploits over the last seven months. Would you like to know my conclusion? - I am psychologically disturbed. - How so? Why else would I continually be led into situations... ...where you deliberately withhold your plans from me? Why else? You've never complained about my methods before. - I'm not complaining. - What do you call this? How am I complaining? I never complain. Do I complain about you practicing the violin in the morning... ...or your mess, your lack of hygiene, or the fact that you steal my clothes? We have a barter system. Do I complain about you setting fire to my rooms? - Our rooms. - The rooms. When do I complain that you experiment on my dog? - Our dog. - On the dog. Gladstone is our dog. Where I do take issue is your campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary. I understand. - Do you? - I do. - I don't think you do. - You're overtired. - Yes. - You're feeling sensitive. I'm not sensitive. What you need is a rest. My brother, Mycroft, has a small estate near Chichester. Beautiful grounds. There's a folly. We can throw a lamb on the spit. We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country, it would be with my future wife. - Well, certainly, if we must... - No, not you. Mary and I. - You are not... - What, invited? Why would I not be invited to my brother's country home? Now you're not making any sense. You're not human. MAN: John Watson? Yes. Your bail's been posted. WATSON: Mary. Just Watson. I hope you get bail by breakfast, because the boys are getting hungry.  LESTRADE: Step lively. Back off. Back off. To which the barman says, ""May I push in your stool?""  Right, you, you're out. Until next time, Big Joe. Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes. Thank heaven you're here. I'd almost run out of jokes. In another life, you'd have made an excellent criminal. And you, sir, an excellent policeman. Tomski, thank you. Now, please tell me you have answers. All in good time, Lestrade. ""All in good time""? Is this some parlor game where we guess what you're thinking? I've got a public in frenzy out there. If you don't fill me in... ...I'll have you in there playing Victoria and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner. Now, clean up and make yourself presentable. For whom? Friends in high places. They're the ones who bailed you out.  I'm terribly sorry to inconvenience you, sir... ...but I'm gonna have to put this on you. Mr. Holmes, apologies for summoning you like this. I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are and who I am. As to where I am... ...I was, admittedly, just for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn. But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill... ...the only baker to use a certain French glaze on their loaves... ...a Brittany sage. The carriage forked left, then right, a telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit. And as to who you are, that took every ounce of my not inconsiderable experience. The letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram. Lord Chief Justice, that'd be your official title. Who you really are is, of course, another matter entirely. Judging by the sacred ox on your ring... ...you're the head of the Temple of the Four Orders... ...in whose headquarters we now sit... ...on the northwest corner of St. James's Square, I think. As to the mystery, the only mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me at all. Yes, well, standard procedure, I suppose.  I daresay we have the right man, gentlemen. Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador Standish from America... ...and Lord Coward, the home secretary. I suppose you already have some notion as to the practices of our order. HOLMES: Yes. Um... They're practically interesting. Be as skeptical as you like. But our secret systems have steered the world towards good for centuries. The danger is they can also be used for more nefarious purposes. What some call the dark arts, or practical magic. STANDISH: We know you don't believe in magic, Mr. Holmes. We don't expect you to share our faith... ...merely our fears. Fear is the more infectious condition. In this instance... ...fear of your own child. Blackwood is your son. You have the same irises, a rare dark green... ...with diamond-shaped hazel flecks... ...together with identical outer ears, which are only passed down through bloodline... ...which makes you either brothers... ...or, in this case, more likely, father and son. Very few people are privy to that information... ...and we want to keep it that way. He was conceived during one of our rituals. His mother wasn't my wife... ...but she shared our beliefs. She was a powerful practitioner... ...though not enough to survive giving birth to him. Death followed him wherever he went. Those five girls were not the first to be butchered. He killed many more, using them to enhance his powers. No one could prove anything, of course, but we all knew. The boy was a curse. We've done our best to stop him, but it's not enough. His power grows daily. His resurrection is evidence of that. But what he does next will be more dangerous. ROTHERAM: His secret lies in the book of spells. This is the source of his power. He's gonna raise a force that will alter the course of the world. We want you to find him and stop him before he does. COWARD: We'll give you any assistance that we can. As home secretary, I have considerable influence over the police. HOLMES: Hm, yes. COWARD: So... The benefit of being a consulting detective... ...is that I can pick and choose my clients. So consider it done, I'll stop him. But not for you. And certainly not for a price. - I do have a parting query, Sir Thomas. - What is that? If the rest of his family's dead, how long do you expect to survive? Food for thought. Well, perhaps you'll have better luck opening that. Margaux '58. A comet vintage. How fascinating that an astronomical event can affect the quality... How is it going with our case you refuse to take? - Of the wine. Oh, I've hit a dead end, literally. I found your man. He's buried in Blackwood's tomb. If you still need him. Oh, dear. Hope my client doesn't come looking for a refund. He's a professor, isn't he? Couldn't see his face, but! Spotted chalk on his lapel. I've never known a professor to carry a gun, and on such a clever contraption. Eye patch, nice touch. So case closed... ...which makes this a social visit. No, it's a ""you're in over your head, Irene"" visit. Whoever killed Reordan was covering their tracks... ...which makes you the next loose end to be snipped.  Let it breathe. I've never been in over my head. Leave now. Disappear. You're good at that. Or stay and volunteer for protective custody. If I'm in danger, so are you. Come with me. What if we trusted each other? Hm? You're not listening. I'm taking you to either the railway station or the police station.  So... - Which is it to be? - Careful. You decide. - Which will it be? - What...? I told you to let it breathe. Can you taste the comet? Why couldn't you just come away with me? Never.     Madam, I need you to remain calm and trust me, I'm a professional. But beneath this pillow lies the key to my release. - She misinterpreted my intention entire! Y. CLARK: Naturally, sir. That's why I find this modern religious fervor so troubling. - No latitude for misunderstanding. - Faith runs right over reason, sir. Indeed. And chambermaids were once such a liberal breed. My wife's a chambermaid, sir. Anyhow, a good thing she was offended, or we may never have found you. The inspector's been over to Baker Street himself this morning, sir. - Just joking about the wife, sir. - Oh. CLARK: We've checked everything, sir. No sign of a break-in and the butler didn't hear a thing. So body in the bathtub... ...his eyes were wide open, and the only thing missing was... ...his ring, sir. Why did you drain the water? - Out of common decency. - Crime is common, logic is rare. The decent thing to do is to catch the killer, not provide comfort for the corpse. What is that?  - Jasmine bath salts, sir. - Superb. Probably comes from a larger container. It'll either be in the pantry... ...high up where it's warm and dry, or in a linen cupboard with a vent. Constable, you could do worse... ...than to check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints. Data, data, data. I cannot make bricks without clay.  CLARK: Mr. Holmes?  Was it in the cupboard or the pantry? It was in the pantry, sir. I don't know what to make of this. Excellent work. Adieu.  What's the meaning of this, Coward? Why have you called this meeting? Sir Thomas is dead. I nominate Lord Blackwood as head of the order.  Have you lost your mind? You know damn well what he's capable of. BLACKWOOD: Of course he does. That's why we're here. That's why we're all here. My powers and my assets were given to me for one purpose. A magnificent but simple purpose. To create a new future. A future ruled... ...by us. Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step towards a new chapter in our history. Magic will lead the way. Once the people of England see our newfound power... ...they'll bow down in fear. Across the Atlantic lies a colony that was once ours. It will be again. The Civil War has made them weak. Their government is as corrupt and as ineffective as ours... ...so we'll take it back. We will remake the world... ...create the future. These men are with me, Standish... ...but... ...are you? No, sir. I am not. These powers that you're playing with... ...no man can control. Well, gentlemen... ...someone has to stop him, even if you won't. Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.  STANDISH: Save me! Gentlemen... ...don't be afraid. As you can see... ...we are protected. Come, drink your allegiance here. You control the police, now use them. Didn't know you were here. Since this room is no longer yours, do you mind if I utilize it? Be my guest. - In here, chaps. MAN: Where would you like me... ...to put him, sir? - Anywhere is fine. WATSON: Who is he? - The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's. His neck didn't survive the impact of Dredger landing on him. Yes. Thanks for that, by the way. There is consolation in the knowledge that he could be of service to his fellow man. Elbows and arms stained with blood, but it's older than his own injuries. None of it human. He's not a butcher, let me see. Yellow flame, green bursts. An industrial worker.  Pff. Coal. River silt. The slag on his trousers should put him squarely in... - Nine Elms. - Sorry, what? The area you're looking for is Nine Elms. I wondered. Do you remember where I put the Lords Register of members' interests? It's on the stepladder. Well, Blackwood's had his hand in just about everything that's corrosive to the spirit. Woolwich Arsenal. Limehouse Chemical Works. It'll probably be a factory by the river. What's that? Never mind. You don't know where my rugby ball went, do you? No, not a clue. Queenshithe Slaughterhouse. Nine Elms. A factory by the river. Well done. That should lead us to Blackwood, dead or alive. Not us. You. Yes. Just a figure of speech, old boy. He's left it there on purpose.    More coal, doctor. That's a good one. He's such a tit. Oh, God. Yeah. WATSON: Glad to see you two are working hard. And I thought we were trying to be discreet. You would not last one day in the navy. Are you sure there isn't an alternative means of water transportation than that? I guarantee you nobody knows London's waterways better. - Tanner's practically a fish himself. - He certainly drinks like one. Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor. If only just a sense. I better take over, there. Bit tricky down here. Come on, come on. WATSON: Look familiar? HOLMES: Yep. All that's missing is a ginger midget. They cleared something away from here not minutes ago. Like what? Not sure. Something mechanical. Holmes. Look at this. - Chapter and verse. Revelations 1:18. ""I am he that liveth, and was dead."" BLACKWOOD: ""And behold, I'm alive for evermore."" I warned you, Holmes, to accept that this was beyond your control... ...beyond what your rational mind could comprehend. - What a busy afterlife you're having. BLACKWOOD: I want you to bear witness. Tomorrow, at midday, the world as you know it will end. Show me your face, it'll be the end of your world. Save your bullets, Watson. A gift for you.  What was that about saving bullets?  BLACKWOOD: She followed you here, Holmes. You led your lamb to slaughter. Holmes. This game was designed to hurt. Watson! It's warm in here, Watson. In over your head yet, darling? WATSON: Hold on there. ADLER: I can't. Let me take your weight. HOLMES: Give us a leg up, old boy.  These German locks always give me trouble.  It's a band saw. No matter, we have plenty of time. Holmes. - It's not working. - Keep calm. Holmes, hurry up. Don't get excited. Turn off that valve. And we'll bounce in three, two... ...one. Thank you. I'm gonna get after Blackwood. Thank you. We should help the doctor. Holmes! CLARK : Mr. Holmes. Sir. Mr. Holmes. Mr. Holmes, we have an order for your arrest, sir.  Sir! Lord Coward has issued a warrant for your arrest, sir. Now, Watson's alive. Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go.  Will the train be departing on time? The train's been delayed, madam. Shouldn't be long now, though. MAN: The train will depart when I tell it to. And you will leave my employment when I allow you to. I fulfilled my contract. I found Reordan. He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary. So that's me, finished. MAN: Your job was to manipulate Holmes' feelings for you... ...not succumb to them. You have fulfilled nothing. I want what Reordan was making for Blackwood. Finish the job or the next dead body... ...will be Sherlock Holmes. DOCTOR: The surgeon should be along shortly. He should be able to rest now. Excuse me. Is that the best you can do? Yes, for now. I must attend to my other patients. MARY: Doctor. Doctor. Please. I know that you care for him as much as I do. This is not your responsibility, it was his choice. He'd say that it was worth the wounds.  Solve this. Whatever it takes.  BLACKWOOD: This is beyond your control. CLARK: Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic. - It's Lord Blackwood, sir. ADLER: I've never been in over my head. WATSON: IT's nothing to do with me, but I advise you leave the case alone. MARY: Solve this. WATSON: Are you, Holmes? BLACKWOOD: Accept that this was beyond your control. - Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end. LESTRADE: I've got a public in frenzy. WATSON: Holmes! BLACKWOOD: Widen your gaze. You must widen your gaze. Widen your gaze. You and I are bound together on a journey that will twist the very fabric of nature. Steel your mind, Ho! Mes. Widen your gaze. ROTHERAM: He's gonna raise a force that will alter the world. COWARD: His power grows daily. ROTHERAM: This is the source of his power. BLACKWOOD: I need you. ROTHERAM: His secret lies in the book of spells. BLACKWOOD: Three more will die... ...and there is nothing you can do to save them. STANDISH: We know you don't believe in magic. WATSON: Reordan was working with Blackwood. ADLER: Is that better? WATSON: He clearly felt something was coming to get him. His eyes were wide open and the only thing missing was his ring. BLACKWOOD: Give up, Holmes. This is a riddle you cannot solve. ADLER: Good morning. Now, you need to work. Familiar artwork. You look gorgeous. HOLMES: Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave. You made the front page. Only a name and no picture. So it looks like you'll be needing to work outside the law now... ...and that's my area of expertise. I feel safer already. You seem to be making a rapid recovery. Yes. Took the shrapnel out myself. Mary said I had a lousy doctor. Well, I'm... I'm just so... ...very glad that you're... ...well... ...with us.  Now that you're sitting comfortably, I shall begin. My initial approach was far too narrow. When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville Prison... ...he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum, I have done just that. In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity. But that's for another time. Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system... ...that's been employed by the Temple of the Four Orders for centuries. To fully understand the system, to get inside it... ...I reenacted the ceremony we interrupted at the crypt... ...with a few enhancements of my own. My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended... ...and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail, I have emerged enlightened. The fraternity who silently control the empire... ...share the belief with the kings, pharaohs and emperors of old... ...that the sphinx was a door to another dimension... ...a gateway to immeasurable power. It's made up of four parts: The foot of a lion, the tail of an ox... ...the wings of an eagle, and the head of a man. In Sir Thomas's secret chamber, I found the bone of an ox... ...the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle and hair of a man. Map. The points of the star represent the five murdered girls... ...but the cross is what we're now interested in. It's a widely held belief... ...that within the architecture of the great cities... ...are coded references to this system. Since he rose from the grave, Blackwood has killed three men... ...each committed at a location that has a connection with the temple... ...therefore the system. Reordan, the ginger midget, represents man. We found his body here. Sir Thomas, master of the temple, wore the ox ring. He died here. Standish, ambassador to America... ...where the eagle has been the national emblem for over 100 years. The headquarters of the Temple of the Four Orders where he died... ...is here. Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act. So we have man, the ox, eagle. Only the lion remaining. Right here. Parliament. Right. You four stay here and the rest of you come with me. LESTRADE: Get out of the way, you lowlifes! - Right this way. Ladies first. LESTRADE: Now. HOLMES: Follow these instructions. - Aren't you...? HOLMES: Go. Hello, hello, hello. Did the devil turn up? Well... ...never mind. You got the next best thing. Beg your pardon, my Lord. I know that it's unorthodox... ...but Mr. Holmes here... ...he's been making some serious accusations about you... ...and the order. I see. Well, at least that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector.   Excuse me, my Lord... ...but I've been wanting to do that for a long time. Well, inspector, I have five minutes before my next engagement... ...so why don't you regale me with your stories of conspiracy? Thank you, Lestrade. My Lord. I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist Blackwood in all the murders... ...orjust the one I prevented? Very distinctive, those handmade shoes of yours. But the price of quality is often the unique imprint they leave. Nonetheless, I confess to being completely outmatched. I could deduce very little from my investigation. Fortunately, there's nothing more stimulating... ...than a case where everything goes against you. How many members of Parliament do you intend to murder at noon today? Man, ox, eagle, lion. The lion is Parliament, isn't it? Very clever. But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes. It's mercy. We are giving the weak masses a strong shepherd. Don't you see that it's for their own? HOLMES: No, but I don't care much what you think. I simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's ceremony... ...and you've given it to me. I've told you nothing. HOLMES: But your clothes say infinitely more than you could ever hope. The mud on your boots from where you've been walking. A touch of red brick dust on your knee from where you've been kneeling. A small bandage on your thumb from where you've been vowing. A faint aroma of excrement from where you've been standing. You and Blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony... ...in the sewers beneath Parliament less than an hour ago. Both houses meet today. The whole government will be present. COWARD: It's a shame you made an enemy out of Blackwood, Holmes. You would have made a valuable ally. How terrible is wisdom... ...when it brings no profit to the wise. We take power at noon. There isn't any time to waste then, is there? TANNER: I told you he'd be coming out the top window. There isn't any way he'd be coming over that terrace. Technically, that isn't the top window, is it, sailor boy? - What is it? - Well, it's the middle window. Anyway. You'll be pleased to know Lestrade performed perfectly. In fact, I think he enjoyed it. I hope you know what you're doing. Here's the key. - You got all you needed from Coward? - Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease. - Tanner? - Sir? If you would, captain... ...take us under the bridge, port side, 100 yards. Beyond that you'll find the tunnel that leads us to the sewers. Right away, sir.   The end is nigh. Blackwood's come back from hell and laid a curse upon this land. He walks in every shadow and every puff of smoke. Behold, he cometh with clouds... ...and every eye shall see him... ...and every soul shall wail because of him. You cannot stop him! No one can!  Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed. ADLER : What does it do? HOLMES: It's a chemical weapon. The first of its kind. You deduced that how? From my pocket. I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse. Note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of bitter almonds. - Telltale traces of cyanide. ADLER: Cyanide. WATSON: Shh. HOLMES: Now we know what the ginger midget was working on. It'll revolutionize warfare.  Yes, killing a lot of people. Now, it's seven minutes to noon. What are we gonna do? Right. How many men did you count on the...?  She loves an entrance, your muse. HOLMES : Woman! Shoot him. Now, please. My lords. The time has come... ...for only those who believe to remain. Behold... ...Lord Blackwood.  You seem surprised. I have returned from beyond the grave to fulfill England's destiny... ...and extend the boundaries of this great empire.  Listen to the rabble outside. Listen... ...to the fear. I will use that as a weapon... ...to control them... ...and then the world. I've never seen anything like it. Look at this. Specifically designed to prevent us from disarming it. These appear to be designed to receive a signal of some sort. Electromagnetic waves? HOLMES: When triggered, the electrodes... ...will send a charge converting the chemical into gas. The gas will travel up that shaft and filter through the ventilation system... ...that leads directly to Parliament. Within seconds... ...the most powerful men in the world will be choking on death. Blackwood must have some transmitter that he can activate remotely. Three minutes, 10 seconds. I will create an empire that will endure for millennia... ...indestructible... ...and eternal. Move it. Move it. We don't actually have to disarm the device... ...we just have to remove the cylinders. Yes, except that they're welded in. What we need is a controlled explosion. We'll need a container to direct the blast. My clay pipe should service that ambition.    I rather wish you hadn't done that, Irene.  On the 12th chime, I will summon the dark powers. All those of you who are with me shall be protected. All others... ...will perish. I need your pipe. Nut him! - Right. - What? - Coat. - Got it. The new order... ...begins now. Woman. What are you waiting for?   That. MAN: Apprehend Lord Coward. - Can you manage? - Course I can. Relax... ...l'm a doctor.  Did you take a wrong turning somewhere? We're safe now. Interesting assessment. Run off. I won't be chasing you anymore. Fare thee well. I don't want to run anymore. - I'll tell you everything. - I wish you would. No! There was never any magic. Only conjuring tricks. The simplest involved paying people off... ...like the guard who pretended to be possessed outside your cell. Your reputation and the inmates' fear did the rest. Others required more elaborate preparations... ...like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb. You had it broken before your burial, then put back together using an adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe... ...a mixture of egg and honey... ...designed to be washed away by the rain. Holmes! Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub... ...required more modern science. Very clever of Reordan to find a paralytic... ...that was activated by the combination of copper and water... ...and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained. That might've been a challenge for me... ...had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians. The death of Standish was a real mystery... ...until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf. An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid... ...yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue. Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered the temple? All it took was a spark. A simple rigged bullet in his gun. Ingenious. Like all great performers, you saved your pice de rsistance for the end: A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide and refined in the bellies of swine. Had it worked... ...your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed... ...as their colleagues were dying around them. They didn't know you'd given them the antidote. Instead, they would've believed it was magic... ...and that you'd harnessed the ultimate power. And the world would've followed, fear being the most powerful weapon of all.  You'd better hope that it's nothing more than superstition... ...as you performed all the rituals perfectly. The devil is due a soul, I'd say. For God's sake, Holmes, cut me loose.  HOLMES: First, the world will see you for what you are. A fraud. Then you'll be hanged. Properly, this time. It's a long journey from here to the rope.   I've never woken up in handcuffs before. I have. Naked.  ADLER: Storm's coming. HOLMES: Well, we've still got a moment. Moriarty. What? That's his name. And he is a professor. Everyone has a weak spot... ...and he found mine. Where was it, precisely? - Please don't underestimate him. - Mm. He's just as brilliant as you are... ...and infinitely more devious. We'll see about that. You'll miss me, Sherlock. Sadly... ...yes. WATSON: Just keep it under your hat. DRIVER: Afternoon, sir. I put the notebooks in this one, sir. WATSON: Thank you. - What's in these, John? Scribbles. - Scribbles? - Notes. MARY: They're your adventures. I'd like to read them.  Come on, what's wrong? Do you think he's come to terms with you leaving? Mary, look at the ring he's given us. Now, five minutes here and we'll go home. Our home. Get up those stairs.  Don't worry, dear. Suicide is not in his repertoire. He's far too fond of himself for that. Holmes. Oh. Good afternoon. I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution. Clearing your good name, as it were. But it had a surprisingly soporific effect... ...and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon. Good afternoon, dear. WATSON: Get on with it, Holmes. Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook. Oh, dear, my legs have fallen asleep. I should come down. John, shouldn't we help him down? No, no, no, I hate to cut him off midstream. Carry on. Well, the executioner attached it to a harness... ...allowing the weight to be distributed around the waist... ...and the neck to remain intact. My Lord, I can't feel my cheeks. Might we continue this at ground level? How did you manage it, Holmes? I managed it with braces, belts and a coat hook. Please, my tongue is going, I'll be of no use to you at all. - Worse things could happen. - John. Yet none of this explains Blackwood's lack of pulse. HOLMES: Right. Now, the medical mystery. We must restore your reputation, Watson. There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum. It's infamous in the region of Turkey bordering the Black Sea... ...for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis. Enough to mislead a medical mind even as well-trained as your own. - It's known as... - What's wrong with Gladstone? HOLMES: - Mad honey disease. Oh, he's demonstrating the very effect I've just described. He doesn't mind. Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse. CLARK: Mr. Holmes? Doctor. Miss Mary. Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me right away. - What is it is this time, Clarkie? - It's one of our sergeants, sir. He went missing the day you stopped Lord Blackwood. ! 'm afraid sewage workers found his body just this morning, sir. We believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene. Can I help you, officer? Shot in the head. Was it a small caliber bullet? Yes. Were there powder burns on his eyebrows? Indeed, sir. Point blank range? Moriarty. Professor Moriarty. MARY: Oh, there's a good boy. Everything's gonna be fine. Where is Blackwood's device now? Secret Service have it, sir. They've taken over the case. I'd wager there's a piece missing. So Moriarty was after a piece of the machine... ...not the poison. There's nothing more elusive than an obvious fact. The wire-free invention was the game all along. And Adler was just the diversion. He knew! 'd chase her, heaving the machine accessible. A technology of that kind would be worth an untold fortune. Imagine being able to control any device... ...simply by sending a command via radio waves. It's the future, Watson.  I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir. - Well... - Well...  MARY: Gladstone. - Stop him before he gets to the front door. HOLMES: Clarkie. Case reopened.

Hopefully, in a few hours, we'll have our answer. We'll hit from three directions: We'll go in with a water team, vehicle assault and we got guys on foot. We cannot make a move until our UCs have ID'd the drugs and called us in. No call, we back away. And these guys we're going after... they got a lot of firepower and they hate the law. So eyes open out there. Bravo's on the move. Heads up. Here comes the drop. Fuck. My lens is flaring. I can't see shit. Brothers! Gather around!

That's what I think. My partner came here tonight prepared to die. Hell Hell, no! Incinerating trash like you. Ready to die, right, Marcus? - The fuck I wanna do that for? - Scared, ain't you, boy? A: Put the gun down, tell me who brings this shit in... and maybe I'll just pop one in your shoulder. Or B: Keep acting all Brody, and I'll put one in your chest. Or C: You know, take the time to talk a minute. You know, de-escalate the situation. See, that's my partner's new spiritual bullshit. Me? I actually prefer shooting motherfuckers. A lot of movement going on. Can't see the UCs. - I think something's going down. - Don't move yet. Mike, the man has a gun to my head. He'll put it down if a hollow point's in his eye! Your partner's a cocky nigger. - Damn. Now, was that necessary, sir? - See? He can't just be a cop? He got to be a nigga too? I'll hot this fool. - Calm down. - Calm down? I'm calm. I'm calm! Hey! I am way too unstable for that bullshit. Stop all the goddamned movement! Everybody stop moving! We can't let you all go, but this shit will get worked out in court. We got our rights. Exercise your right to shut the fuck up. I'm all right. I'll give you a warning. It's the best I can do for all of youse! Okay? He's crazy. - You got three seconds to drop your gun. - He has anger issue problems! - One. - He goes to bed early for this shit! Just to wake up to pop one in a motherfucker! - Two! - Mike, no! Gun! Rock 'n' roll! Let's go! Kill them cops! Marcus! Go! Go! Go! Come on, go! - Get down! - Drop the! - I didn't do shit! - Get your hands up. I didn't do it! The radios were fucked up.

I shot you? - Yeah. I mean, I was shooting. Yeah, I did a lot of shooting. But I ain't saying I shot you in the ass. I ain't saying I didn't shoot you... but, damn! Somebody shot you in the ass. Tell me about it. - Yo, man, how's it feel? - It's hot, man. I can smell my ass burning. Mike, you should give it a little kiss so it'll feel better. Pretend like we're not even here. Hey, isn't Ricky Martin having a concert? Get the fuck on. - You always gotta go racial, man. - It's sad, man. I think it's cool. It hit the meat. It ain't nowhere near the hole. Two lousy bags? What about the biggest shipment of ecstasy to come out of Amsterdam? Let me worry about my snitch, all right? It's a lot of cop work for nothing! Take your ass home somewhere. Tonight la policia jacked my mules. Who can tell me how those jackals knew where to bite Johnny Tapia? Speak up, cousins. You're lucky they did not find my drugs on Dixie 7. Change the boat schedule. We can't. We got a shipment Thursday. Change it after. Just keep them guessing. You know, unlike you, my daddy didn't leave me no trust fund. I got real-world shit to deal with, Mike. I'm not in it for the thrills. Same old shit, different day. All right, yes, damn. I shot you, all right? But you'd be seeing nothing at all if I hadn't made my move. I don't know why you acting so angry. - You're misinformed. I'm not angry. - No, you're very angry. No, I'm not angry. You are angry. It's okay. I'm not angry. Except when you keep repeating ""you're angry."" That shit's fucking annoying. Like a fucking gnat at a barbecue. Just bugging the fuck out of me. Good. I want you to say: ""I'm angry. It's okay. I'll process my anger. I love myself."" I don't know what the fuck you mean. Yes, you do know what the fuck I mean. You're the one that needs therapy. - I did my therapy. - When? Captain Howard made me do it after I shot them people at the airport. Officer Mike. - Papi. That's ""daddy,"" right? - Yeah. Mike, you go to therapy to get your issues worked out... not bang your therapist. - See, now you just talking nasty. - I gotta survive. I gotta start loving me for me. That sound like that group thing. Maybe I did the group thing once or twice. And: A bunch of men hugging and kissing, that's some cult shit. Buy. Ignore him, doc, he's blowing this out of proportion. My ass is what's out of proportion, Mike, okay? I got a big chunk missing. It's actually a small chunk. This tension you bringing into this relationship... won't be healthy in the long run. Maybe there ain't gonna be no long run. Whatever. He's seeing a shrink. I mean: - Icepick, Lowrey. - Hey, brother. Two bags? You embarrassed me in front of my people. Wait, brother. No, no, no, brother. Wait, wait, wait. Whatever. You better pray to whoever it is you pray to... because you got 24 hours to find that X before I find you. The cops hit my mule. Well, Mr. Tapia, I don't know where the heat is coming from. It's a delicate situation for both of us, isn't it? - I'm telling you, I've checked them. - Alex, look. A guy's OD'ing. I'm sorry, I gotta hang up. Some fucking punk thinks he can die in my club. Ecstasy fucks them up. - Get him out of here, Josef. - Sure. We'll dump him around the block. Dump him. Auntie Syd, it must be so cool. Young, single, living in New York. Probably hook up with a lot of cute guys. - Just like Sex and the City. - Theresa, cancel the damn cable. So, Auntie Syd, you're a cop too, huh? Sort of. I work for the DEA, but I just push a lot of papers. - Nothing exciting. - Well, you keep pushing papers. Don't have to worry about my little sister fighting crime. Okay? Possibly getting hurt. James. Get my screwdriver. Damn bolts. Ignore him. He's being mean because he got injured. - Are you okay? - His wound is fine. It's... other things that were affected. - Theresa! - What? You It's just nerve damage, that's all. Y'all not gonna spoil it. I'll talk to you about it. It's a donut. It's a medical thing. I got it from a maternity store. You know, pregnant women use it. They can put one cheek here. It take pressure off the other cheek. - For you, dog. - Thoughtful. Look, man... last night there was something different in your eyes. You know, Mike, I had an epiphany. You know? - I realised you're an enigma. - Yeah, I could see that. God sent you here to test me. But guess what. You not gonna break me, Mike. No. Is that Syd? - That's Syd. - Now's not a good time. Mike, listen, now's not a good time. Hit me, hit me, hit me. No throwing balls in the house. - What's up, Theresa? - Hey. Aw, they ain't tell me it was a luau. Hey, hey. Hey, whoa, Syd. Hold up.

You didn't tell Marcus about New York. - He knows about New York. - About us? You told him about us? No, he knows about New York. You know, it's a nice city and that I dropped a witness off last month. Mike is so sweet. - So sweet he make your teeth rot. - So have you told him yet? Baby, soon, okay? Real soon. He needs to know you're transferring and won't be his partner anymore. Theresa, timing is everything. Marcus is not very happy with me right now. - Mike. - No, no, Syd, I'm telling you. That is Scarface limping around in there. We need to give that boy a few minutes to let his butt heal up good. We like each other. What's the big deal? I'm just gonna go tell him right now, because this is dumb. Hold up. Hold up. I'm gonna tell him. It ain't like I won't tell him. How am I not tell him? - When? - I need a minute. Straight up. We're not vibing right now. I just need a minute. Mike, he's my brother, okay? Don't be scared. Toughen up, chief. Hey. Hey, I ain't say I was scared. Just There's something wrong with your brother. So, Mike, I understand you were in New York last month. Yeah, I was... - Remember I did the thing? - No. You remember? The two of you should've gotten together. That would've been nice. I never told you Mike was in New York. Well, you know what, Mike? Syd, she's gonna be in town, what, another week? Why don't you show her around? That'd be nice. That would be so great. Yeah. Yeah, I could Well, me and... Marcus, you wanna show her some stuff? Yeah, because I'm in town on vacation. I'm staying at the most amazing hotel. The view, the pool. Oh, my God. We got a pool right here. That ain't exactly a pool, man. That's like a big-ass puddle wrapped in blue plastic. Didn't they have any good pools when you bought this one? Megan, that pool cost $3900. Okay, so how much do the good pools cost? - It's all right, baby. - It is kind of whack, huh? I gotta go meet somebody. It was nice seeing you again, Mike. Nice Good to see you. Where you going? - Bye, sweetie. - Bye. I thought you were on vacation. So glad you could join us, Mike. I'm telling you, spending time like this make a partnership strong. Mike, can I see you by my stupid pool? What's the deal, baby? Why you gotta always come over here and try to take over, Mike? - What are you talking about? - This is my family, man. Okay? - What are you talking about? - My place of peace. Are you taking medication? You taking medicine for the thing, right? - What'd I do? - Forget it. Just forget it. - What'd I do? - Mason, go fetch. Oh, shit! Now, that shit is funny. That's some funny shit. Oh, man, hold up. Yo, Lowrey, you hot. Thirty-nine hundred dollars. Thirty-nine hundred. You better pray to God you right this time. Yo, dry off, sweetheart. Icepick said the Haitian Zoepounds about to do a rip. Let's move. All right, guys, smarten up. Talk to me. Eyes on, agents. Good luck. This is 105. They're backing in. I got a good look. - We got a good eyeball. - All right, we're in. What's up? You come highly recommended out of New York. You did some good jobs for our Russian crew up there. How old are you? Old enough. Come on. If you wanna move this stuff you gotta do it quick. Wow, nice getup. You can start to run these through. I'd like to see how your machine works. That sounded dirty. ""I would like to see how your machine works, baby."" I wouldn't be so crude. I mean, I'm more of a refined kind of a human being. You follow ballet? Three of my cousins are dancing with the famous Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. I like hippie-hop too. I gave you 5000. You gave me 4900. - I gave you 5000. - Forty-nine hundred. - Five thousand. - Count it. If you want to fuck with me again, find yourself another chump. Okay. - How much? - Three. Look at this. Money everywhere. Clean it up. Okay, we wanna change a little over $3 million, all right? How many jobs did you do with my friends up there in New York? Quite a few. How you behave with me has consequences for a lot of people. You found me, not the other way around. You need me to change small bills to large ones and deliver to a third party. I bet he'd like his money in a timely fashion. Delivery's late, it's your ass, not mine. Here's 50,000 in 100s for your 50,000 in 10s. Third party takes his million in these five briefcases here. - I hope I'm not losing you, chief. - I hate math. So for your $3 million that we shrunk for you... you get 2 million in clean money back. Less our percentage: $300,000. - I'll be delivering these to your dealer. - Alexei. - What? - We're giving too fucking much away. We take all the risk. And our suppliers take too much of our profit. Yeah, we'll call the general, renegotiate. He's a businessman, we're businessmen. Yeah, call him. You call. Agents, we're on the move to the money drop. Forward. Hey, man, the truck's leaving.

Get over here, I'm undercover. And please call off your dogs. I got DEA watching my back, so don't blow my case. - We saved your life. - And I appreciate that. What I don't appreciate is you two following me here... nearly burning a case that took five months to set up. So now we lie to each other? Is that what we do? - What do you want me to do? - All right. - Fuck that, Mike, she's wrong. - Calm down. Relax. Syd, are there drugs in that truck? - There's cash. - Where's it going? - I can't tell you that. - Why not? Because I have a career and if I wanna keep it, I have rules to follow. What's that mean? My orders are, under no circumstances share information with Miami P.D... - because they got too many leaks. - Oh, I'm Miami P.D. now? You done forgot I'm your big brother, huh? You know what, Syd, that shit you did was reckless... it was stupid and it was dangerous. Okay? I'm telling Mommy. Okay? I'm definitely leaking that shit. Hey, Marcus Syd, come on, he got a point. Your brother loves you. Not to mention a little thing called professional courtesy. You bouncing in somebody's yard, you should let them know about it. First time using your gun? Hey, you handled yourself very well. Too bad your partner didn't notice. Thanks. Think you get off that easy? You been working this for five months? How come you ain't tell me in New York? - What would you have said? - I would've I'd have let you know this job is rugged, you know. It's dangerous. And if something happen to you I might... Exactly why I didn't say anything. Somebody stealing your money. The drop's done. I gotta go. Thanks. We gotta close this case before it get her killed. Yeah, no doubt. You ready to go back to the station, get our asses whupped? I think we gonna be all right. Fellas. What's your job description? No, you two. What is your job description? I'll tell you. TNT: Tactical Narcotics Team. Keyword: ""tactical."" ""Displaying finesse and subtlety in achieving a goal!"" Tell me, gentlemen... what was subtle about your work today? Twenty-two cars... and a boat, totalled? How did you sink a boat? We didn't sink it. All right, the positive. Thank God no cops died. The negative: I got a police commissioner so far up my ass... if he spits, it's coming out of my mouth. But I know that there's always two sides to a story. So, what's yours? Well, I was at a family barbecue. We got a tip that the Zoepounders... were gonna do a hit on cash or drugs from this big-time X-man. That's what they call a ecstasy dealer on the streets. Marcus, I know what they call them. That's why I'm captain. It's cool. So you got the drugs. No drugs. Oh, okay. All right. How about the money? - No money. - Nope. Then who is this X-man? Captain, I was at a family barbecue. So I We don't know, but we are going to find out. Well, then all that... - was for nothing? - We didn't do all of that. If you look close Watch. Hold up. Let me s There's DEA all over. Wait, the Wait, hold up. The DEA? Without consulting me? That's a DEA car right there. Christ! Fuck! Cap. No. Remember your pressure points. Do my My exercises. Holler at your boy. Twenty-one thousand? What? Oh, kiss my black ass. It was the dashboard. - You know what? - Better. Yeah, you'll get your money. Somebody's on they way with your money. Is it possible we could discuss potential reimbursement We don't cover personal property. That's why we drive police cars. So where do we go from here? Zoepounders knew exactly when to hit the drop, where to hit the drop... so we figure they know where the cash is. We find the cash, we find the X-man. Hey, I'm through playing games, all right? I have three cops critical. I got kids dying on my streets from souped-up X. I do not want these animals taking over my city. Do you understand? So I want you guys to do whatever you do, whatever it takes, but do it now. It's not good, boss. Oh, my God. Fucking ratones eating my fucking money. Carlos, this is a stupid fucking problem to have. But it is a problem nonetheless. Rat fuckers. Rat fuckers. Boss, it ended up crazy. This black chica working for the Russians was a maniac lunatic. She saved your money. She wasted some Haitians and got the load to the drop. Also, Roberto saw these two crazy gangbanger homeys. - Oh, shit. - Yeah. Chasing and shooting. Old days, did I have this problem? No. Just fly the drugs in and ship the money out. Now American security's so goddamned tight over the water... and in the sky... that the rats eat my money before I can get it to Cuba. - You see? - Fiery crash... I can't even get my money across town without making the news. Hey, man. Man. Tell me... should I be worried? - No, boss. - Shut the fuck up. People is trying to jack my loads here in Miami. I own this fucking town. You see? This is my town. Oh, my God. Pink. Pink, nia, pink. Pink. No powder blue. Pink is prettier. But the lady at the store said I look like a model. You're lucky your mother was my mother's cousins. Don't pay attention to Roberto. Besides, models are filthy creatures. You look more like an angel. - What do you think, Carlos? - Of course. - Roberto, what do you think? - It's fucking beautiful. Talk polite in front of my little bonbon... or I'm gonna chop your balls off. For real, I'm straight with all your spiritual enlightenment and that shit. But I need to know if a crackhead rolls to me with a .9, you'll cook that fool. No question about it. Shoot him in the leg. Come on with that leg shit. - Everybody deserves a little dignity. - What about my dignity? Your crackhead will be missing a kneecap. I'll be in a body bag. - So sad. - What's so sad? Your untreated control issues. It's not your fault. What in the hell is that supposed to mean? Your mama probably refused you her tit when you were a baby. You grew up a malnourished high-school softie. Got your gun, little tight T-shirt... and became a overcompensating tough guy. That is the last time you will ever refer to my mother's titties. I don't even want them up in your head. You know, I said all that, Mike, and all you heard was ""titties."" Man, you can't keep suppressing my spiritual growth, Mike. You need to suppress my mother's titties out of your psychoanalysis. You just remember one thing, my friend. I may not always be here. What's up, Icepick? Jesus is the way, my brothers. Step inside. You just went number one on Uncle Mike's shit list. - We got two lousy bags, man. - My brothers. Haitian blond with dreads. Where is he? Blondie Dread? He's very expensive.

Warm it up. Don't hurt nothing. Yo, yo, watch this. Watch this. This the shit right here. This is the shit. - What you doing to my shop? - Watch this spin. Wait. - What are you doing? - Oh, give me some. You're ruining my shop. Stop! - Do the dance thing. - I'm gonna bring the house down. Stop! Stop! He lives in a pink house eight blocks from here on Carl Street. One... - Police! Get down. - Police! Who that? Who in my house? - I'm the devil, who's asking? - The devil is not welcome here! You got to call yourself the devil in his house? Shit! You're in my house! This is all your fault! - You're in my country, though. - Fuck you, how's that? - I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker! - Your country, my ass! - Fuck you. - Fuck me? Fuck you! You no problem! Mike, do you have to be so combative? Fucking! You calling me a bitch? Do or die, man! A bullet in the head will really mess up your extensions. Take your bullet and eat that shit, man. How about that? What the? Sir, we just wanna talk. You wanna talk? Well, go ahead. Go ahead. We're not Immigration. They can't hear you because they're still shooting at you.

Do you know anything? I'm gonna be nice about it. Do you know anything? Let's ask some other suspects. - Hey, look, man, fuck it. - Let's try this. Let's talk to his homeys. Hey, look here, man. Can you tell me who was driving the black Suburban? Oh, he don't know nothing. His brains is under the end table. He can't tell us shit, Mike. - He's all fucked up. - What's your point?

We're gonna set you up on the wide-screen. Correct ratio. There you go. ""Spanish Palms Mortuary."" Why would they be doing surveillance at a funeral home? Is that a Cuban flag? Right there. See the gun? Never knew guards at funeral homes needed to carry them kind of weapons. It just seems like we should turn it off... because my dad owns the store. She got a tongue ring. - This is like a porno. We're not - Dude. Dude. - All right? - Yeah. Okay. Okay.

My ass still hurts... from what you did to it the other night. Oh, my Lord. Yeah, it got rough. You know? I mean, we got caught up in the moment, shit got crazy. You know how I get. When you popped me from behind, I think you damaged some nerves. Okay. Now, I can't I can't Now, I can't... - Can't what? - I can't even get an erection. What's an erection? I tried taking Viagra, you know, pop one, pop two. Been eating them like Skittles. That poor man is pouring out his heart. And I'm still flaccid. Okay. I'm comfortable talking to you... It's got 5. 1 Dolby. ...about what I did to your ass... but you not getting an erection... that's a real problem for me. - I just figured I could talk to you. - Yeah. No, no. We're We partners, but we are partners with boundaries. We got a new rule. From now on you can't say the word ""flaccid"" to me. He's a mean fuck. Look here. This is our little boundary box. So we gonna take the word ""flaccid""... and we're gonna put it in there with my mom's titties... with your erection problems, and we're gonna close this box... and we're gonna throw this bitch in the ocean. And the only way that you can get to this box... is you got to be motherfucking Jacques Cousteau. We cool? No... Oh, shit. We gotta go. In front of my babies you got porno and homo shows up in here? What kind of freak-ass store is this? And you two motherfuckers need Jesus. Cover your ears, baby. Palm Mortuary, owned by an offshore holding company... which, after 17 layers of bullshit... turns out to be registered to Donna Maria Tapia... mother of Hector Juan Carlos Tapia, who calls himself Johnny. Johnny Tapia. Shit. Every time the P.D. goes after him... he sues for wrongful arrest. And, oh, does he win. Look. Last year, he was awarded $9 million. And got a dozen dumb-ass officers like you fired. Well, he hasn't run across us yet. We'd love to hear what's going on in that house. Use your computer brain and tap the phone. Well, that happens to be highly illegal without a judge. We were thinking of something more along the lines of a training operation. No, I can't do that. - Get you tickets to the Heat game. - I need floor seats. With thick-ass glasses you don't need floor seats. He can see the game from the parking lot. - I can't work under these conditions. - Floor seats to the Heat. You got it. - Lakers. - Yes, Lakers. Okay. Watch me work. Hello? Is this the pest control? Yeah. We got a fucking problem. You know where we live. - Yeah, South Miami. - We got it. Got our way in. - Illegally? - You gotta put a word to it. It's like, secret. So, y'all wanna kill roaches? - Illegal. - We'll plant a couple gypsy wires... find out what Tapia's up to. These are your basic household bugs. Dog, this is what we do. - What's the sprayers for? - The roaches. - Roaches? We got rats. - Say what? That's not an issue. We can handle that. We'll just have to slightly adjust our approach a little bit. Nope. Nope. I don't mess with no rats. Hey. Stop it. - We're in. Get your head right. - Mike, I'm a grown-ass man. Get your grown-ass self together and let's do this. This is a beautiful house you got here, sir. Well, start looking. They're all over. Those ain't normal rats. What he means is that they're obviously a special breed. - What kind of breed are they? - Big motherfuckers. Disposing of the rats isn't a problem. But we should ensure there's no breeding elsewhere in the house. Yeah, at Zook... we like to work from the outside in, you know. So we gonna leave these Excuse me. We'll leave these here and send in a special unit. It'd be better to begin in the rest of the house. You're not getting in the rest of the house. We won't be able to guarantee our work. The only thing that we can guarantee... is that these rats will keep fucking. Giving off offspring until we find the colony. Rats don't got no stinking colony. Well, actually these are colonial rats. What they do is they send out worker rats that are called... Marsupials. Marsupials. These drones, they're explorers of the rat world, you know. They just looking for rat pussy. - You know. - Are you fucking with me? Hold on. You called us. We can leave. But what you should understand is that these rats will hump twice a day. All right. Down there. Just kill them and bring me the bill. That's that bullshit. That's that bullshit right there. - You see these rats? - Plant your wires. - You're not leaving me with them. - Plant your wires. Gentlemen. Alexei, Josef. Oh, I really like that word, Johnny. ""Gentlemen."" I'm just trying being civil. This is business, we can all relax. - Alexei, would you like a Cohiba? - Why not? Of course. And you? Josef. I'm told you're quite a wine connoisseur. I am. Carlos, have Josef pick a wine and Alexei and I will have a cigar. Come. - Where the fuck you going? - Pretty bad problem you got here. I'm gonna head down to the truck, get some poison pellets and stuff. Come straight back. No screwing around. They're all over. Nice place you got here. It's Mama's, and it's a shithole. Built a fucking million years ago. - Expensive shithole, eh? - Oh, no. My new place, the one I'm building in Cuba. Almost finished. Everything fucking shiny new. Come on upstairs. Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Look at the balls on that motherfucker. Roberto... - the general's office camera is out. - Everything in this house is broken. My wire's planted. - How about yours? - Almost got three wires planted. Mike! There's a papa rat humping the shit out of this mama rat. No, he's straight pile-driving her! Now, how is that information gonna help me do my job? They fuck just like us. Where's the pest guy? There's something going on down here. Goddamn rats. Yeah, they everywhere. Just like cockroaches. No disrespect... but I do not wish to talk business until my partner return. It's baffling. You secretly decide to pay me less and you talk about respect? Let's wait for Josef. You know, me and digits. Carlos, could you bring Josef in? So... your partner is here. Would you like to talk now? Carlos, another box. So, you sign over ownership papers for all the Florida clubs you own... and I will control everything... from point of origin to sale. Okay? No middleman. Especially Russian middleman. With all due respect, Mr. Tapia... in my country, I see such things all the time. I'm sorry for your country. That must be some Cuban stupid tradition to put them in a tortilla bin. Now, listen to me, you Russian punk. I, me, Johnny Tapia, will sever your head off! You kill me, and you will have a shit-storm. Should I screw your young wife... or visit your son, the soccer player? My daughter knows your son. - You're gonna regret this. - I hope that we can remain friends. Because at the end, what else do we have but friendship, trust... honour? Without this, we are no more than beasts. The kitchen monitor's out. What the hell's going on out there? Shit. I found something. - It's a guy's finger. - What, did the rats eat the rest of him? - What the fuck are you doing? - Hey, I was just looking for you. I think I figured out your problem. Y'all a bunch of filthy motherfuckers. Blow out! - What's going on? Shit! - Get out of the house! This shit's got to stop. Fuck! We should go. Go! Go! Just another day with Mike Lowrey. - Damn! Go! - Come on! Roberto thinks they were the gangbangers... that tried to hijack the drop, boss. How did this thing happen? I don't know. We called the rat people and these guys showed up. Maybe you're the rat, huh? They tried to steal from me, and you let them into my mother's house. Johnny. Hey, no. I would never... Nobody puts in danger my daughter, my mother... or my money. Send him to the mortuary. Johnny. Johnny, what happened to Roberto? He killed himself, Mama. - Very sad. - Write a nice letter to his mother. I'll do it. Okay. Bye. - Yo, run the print. - Mike, stop playing, man! - Run the print. - Don't touch me with no dead finger. Excuse me, run this print. I need to find the owner. Thank you. Think you can find out what's on these shreds? Of course. We're thinking about ordering lunch. Should we put you down for some extra crispy and a couple of grape sodas? ""Couple of grape sodas."" - Very funny. That's hilarious. - Isn't it low tide? I think it is. - Don't you have relatives to pick up? - What? Yo, now you crossed the line, man. Okay, no, that's not funny. We're fucking with you. We planted wires, we need some help. No bullshit. I want you... to find out... who those two black puta de mierda are. And I want them lying right here... in Mama's garden in these coffins! And our mystery finger belongs to: Josef Kuninskavich. Oh, man. He was a lieutenant in the Russian mob. Owned a couple dozen Florida nightclubs. Tapia's starting to knock off Russian mob bosses. Got something. What you got, dickhead? The computer matches half tones, grey tones, densities. Sort of like a visual code-breaking. Little something I put together. The shredded papers was a photo. Some kind of boat. ""Dixie 7."" Dixie 7. - It's registered to a one Floyd Poteet. - Poteet brothers. One of the KKK guys we busted. You blew his ear off, remember? Mike, can you teach me how to shoot people? Listen to what we got at Tapia's. The second-in-command is talking. He's telling him, ""Yes, boss. We found a bunch of fat doe fuckers... - and we're getting them emptied."" - ""Fat does emptied""? - The hell does that mean? - He has a meeting this afternoon. - You know who I am? - Name sounds familiar. Sense of humour. I like that. Meet me on the sand, 2:00, Shore Club. - She has no idea. Let's roll. - Y'all come with us. I ordered a couple of Bacardi Mojitos. Miami. Okay, zoom in on nine. A little more audio, please. So why don't we take a swim? Cool off. Or we could just stay here and get drunk. How about that? Or we could drink this later. Unless you have a reason... why you don't want to get that beautiful body of yours wet. Why not just ask if I'm wearing a wire? I'd rather go swimming. - What the hell's he doing? - Son of a bitch. Shit. He's taking her into the water. This guy's smart. I want you to work for me. Why waste time on this unnecessary talking? It's very unnecessary. What do you need with another banker? For the same reason as your previous employer. But now I own all the Russian clubs. No middleman. You know, I'm about to be the biggest importer... and distributor of ecstasy in North America. You're gonna be a very rich young woman. That's why I thought I know what you thought, Mr. Tapia. As long as you don't think it more than once... I'm happy to be in business with you. All right. Let's do business. What are you, a cop or a model? What you talking about, man? Threw something on. I like looking good. What? For who? Hey, don't hate the player. Hate the game. I hate the tailor. Good job. We'll get him. Your brother would love to talk to you down the street. Whoa, what's going on? You trying to blow my case or you just insane? You're the one taking a dip with the Cubano maniac. - How'd you know that? - We had a wire in the house. - You two have a warrant for that wire? - Look, fuck that, okay? You don't know the kind of danger that you're in, Syd. I am fully aware, and I am fully capable of what I am doing. I am not your baby sister anymore. For the DEA, you ain't nothing but a honeypot. What'd you just say? That's why you got the job, because you look good in a bathing suit. All right, let's sit down somewhere. All right, look, Syd, there's some shit you need to know. Johnny Tapia is cutting up Russian mob bosses in his mom's kitchen. In the kitchen, Syd. He found a severed finger by the crock pot. You're about to be in the middle of a drug war. Miami P.D. has arrested this guy 12 times with no convictions. Why don't you just hang back and let us bring him down? Guys, look, I need this, okay? And I am this close. What's ""this close""? I'm in charge of money laundering for his entire operation. In a month or two, we'll have enough for a conviction, and it'll be over. What about a day or two? Sound better? Marcus and I think we found the key to Tapia's whole operation. You have nothing to say now, huh? - Just stuck, right? - Okay, time-out, y'all. Damn. We got this peckerwood that'll put us down... with the transport end of Tapia's operation. Do you want in? - Why would you? - When? - Tonight. - Page me. Should I bring my thong? Get your bitch hands off. I'll knock you the fuck out. Mike, we're trying to keep her out of trouble, man... not invite her in. Man, I just figured, you know, if she with us... that's just less trouble she could get into. I'm gonna keep it real with you too, man. I think she can handle herself. I'm gonna keep it real with you. Don't nobody know my sister like I do. Okay? She doesn't make good choices, Mike. - She's not street-smart. - Doesn't make good? - Like, what kind of choices? - Men, for one. She's attracted to these dumb... flashy, just musclebound dickheads, Mike. You know? Cock diesel motherfuckers that can't even fucking turn to wipe their ass. - You feel me? - Yeah. You know? Just dumb as a bucket of shrimp. Yeah. Yeah. That shit's crazy. I mean, you don't think maybe you Maybe you didn't, like, get a chance to know any of them? I'm gonna give the next one a chance. A chance to whup his ass. - Whup the shit out of him. - Oh, you gonna fight him? What I'm gonna do ain't even gonna be legal. I might be up in here with these motherfuckers. Do you know what I mean? The fuck you looking at? Thank you kindly. - Who sprung me? - Hey, Cousin Floyd. - Oh, you. - Remember me? Cheese. Y'all look great together. - What the fuck you doing? - Just a little insurance. You gonna help us find Dixie 7... and tell us what that boat has to do with Johnny Tapia. - I ain't no snitch. - Oh, you ain't no snitch? - Oh, damn. That's a shame. - Know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna send a special 8 x 10 to his KKK buddies back in jail. You know what, it's a digital photo too. So we can do whatever we want to do with it. By the time we get done with you... you gonna be in the next Busta Rhymes video on BET. Tuck ass. I got my rights. I'm worried. There's too much heat around in Miami. I can feel it. I can feel it. We need to put my money in coffins to Cuba faster. You should tell the mortuary to speed things up. All right? That's the channel marker way out there. They make the drop mostly at dawn, but there'll be one today, though. Syd, you talk to Mama? She's got hives. Oh, and I told Mama about your Cubano boyfriend. He ain't invited to Christmas dinner. Change the station. More music, less Marcus. If you open the door, he'll be a black Dr. Phil for the next 40 minutes. Syd, you might not wanna get too flirty with Mike. Your boyfriend might cut off his trigger finger. Maybe Mike's been flirting with me. Did you ever think about that? Trigger Mike? Not like this. Don't play with that boy. - Seriously. Don't play with that boy. - Just tell him about New York. - Do it. - Tell me what? Oh, shit. Is he walking down the steps? Oh, shit. He coming down. - It's okay. - Yeah, you done fucked up. You done fucked up. You remember... Remember I went to New York? You remember? And... I said, ""Syd."" I ran in Syd ran into me in New York on the street in that place. And I said: ""What's up?"" And we was hungry, so then... she had fish. It was grouper. And then I had some chicken. Remember, I was supposed to come home? But I didn't. We went out on a date. Five, actually. Now we're seeing each other. Hold up. You know, really out of respect for you, Marcus, nothing happened. Hey, Mike, why you tripping, man? I mean, we wanted to make sure you was cool with it. Doesn't matter what I think, you know. Hey, I had to find out like this, right? Don't matter. Let me ask you, y'all gonna have babies? Little bunch of mini Mikes? Bunch of little lying, violent motherfuckers? Marcus, nothing happened. I just wanna say, Mama's gonna be thrilled. All right, you know what, you need to ""whoosah"" or something for a second. Hey, here comes the Dixie 7. Just leave it alone. - Why you acting like that? - Go on about your business, man. - We gonna talk about this. - No. Get out of my face. - I'm trying to talk to you. - Get the fuck off me, Mike. What the hell is your problem, man? Why you acting so stupid? This is a dysfunctional partnership. That's why I'm acting like that. - You know - There ain't no trust. I didn't lie to you! I was waiting for the right time to tell you. But that ain't your issue. Why don't you bring it to me real. What is your problem with this? You know what? You a dog, man. - That's it. There it is. I said it. - Oh, okay. You like a pit bull with that little pink thing hanging out. Oh, it's like that. Oh, okay. I'm not good enough for your sister. Guys, enough. The boat's coming. Okay. We gonna handle that shit. Go ahead, man. In about an hour, the drop boat's gonna come. We got them. Wonder what mortuary that coffin's going to. Keep going straight by. You seeing what I'm seeing? Get the load to the mortuary and don't screw up. I got it. Load up. They're getting away! Stop! Stop! We need your car. All right? - Get out the car. - Can't you get a better car than that? Let that man go! - Don't be coming at me with that tone. - Freak. - Small cars don't hurt the ozone layer. - That's what I'm talking about. - Stop the car. - Get Yeah. - Pop the trunk. Get out. Get in. - Get out. Get out. - Get your ass in. - Okay. - I am in the middle of a sale. - Do I have to pull my gun? Oh, shit. Dan Marino. What's up? Back up, Dan. Hey, you're the truth. - Whatever you need, officers. - That's Dan Marino. - Hey. Back up. - Let me know how it rides. He's gonna test-drive the shit out this. Go. I don't wanna blow my cover. Got them. Got them right there. Why you gotta get so close? - I won't let that coffin get away. - But they're all around us. Shit, those are the gangbangers. Relax, they don't know us. Boss, we got a problem here. We're being followed. This is a big problem, Carlos. - Sorry, boss. I'll take care of it, okay? - Kill those black bitches. All right? They made us. Get some undercovers to roll with us. We're splitting up. Everybody go to Third and Boxter, now! Here we go. I didn't sign up for no goddamned car chase! Have you lost your mind? I see you got your mind set on doing dumb shit, so please let me out! I seen this in a movie once. They didn't make it! Mike. Oh, shit! - Dump truck! - I got it. - Mike! - I'm fine. I'm fine. Mike, whoa. Right there! Oh, shit, Mike! - Did you see that shit? - No shit. Dan Marino should definitely buy this car. Not this one. I'm fucking this one up. But definitely one like this. I almost missed that. All right, that was almost fucked up. I almost fucked up. Shit! This is not necessary. Oh, shit! - Damn! - Dead man on the hood! Dead man! - I'm trying to get it off. - Get it off! I'm trying to get it off. - That shit's nasty. That's nasty. - Get it off! Get That shit is nasty. - Undercover police! Move! - Undercover police! - Move! - Move! Move! Move! Coming around the corner! Get ready, they're coming around the block. Move! Up top! Shit! Boy, if this was my car, I'd be pissed! Get down! Get down! Trying to break the world record for gun fights in a week? This is not the time to criticise! I can't work with you blaming me all the time! - This is not your fault? - This is not No! No! Bullshit, Mike! Everything's your fault! Okay, let's go! Let's go! - Clear room! - Cool! I'm going around! - Mike, got him! - They got the coffin. Move! Move! Move! Get down! Police! Get down! Move! Move! Police! Move! Move! Get out of my way! Move! Move! Get down! Get down! Shit! Open the door! Police! No! Whoa! Shit! Mike! Mike! That boy bit me! Mike! Move! Move! Police! Move! Police! Move! He under there? We lost the coffin... and you barbecued our only lead, Mike. This has got to be the worst, most emotional cop-week of my life. Yeah, it's been a little rough. - Where were these bodies going? - I don't know. It's really strange. All the John Does we found out here are empty. Empty Does. Fat Does. Cut them open, took the organs out. Sewed them back up. Nice work. The more you guys fuck up, the more we look like rock stars. The van you was chasing is a transport for the city morgue. The John Does were being delivered to the university for medical research. - Nice going. - I can't believe you guys. Do you both wake up in the morning, call each other up? ""Good morning, Marcus."" ""Morning, Mike."" ""How you doing?"" ""A'ight."" ""So how are we gonna fuck up the captain's life today?"" ""Gee, I don't know."" ""I don't know."" ""Ooh. Look, over there. Let's kill three fat people... and leave them on the street."" They were dead before we ran over them. It doesn't matter whether they were dead or not, goddamn it! Every time you leave a corpse on the street... I have to get these forensic coroner guys to come to see what happened. Then I gotta get detectives. See? They're detecting shit. Then I gotta get these forensic guys to stick them back in the fucking bag! Jesus Christ! You guys, you're like... You're like a bunch of bloodsucking ticks... draining the life's blood out of this department. Damn the ""whoosah,"" captain. Did you just call me a tick? I was referring to him. - Thought so. - These aren't normal corpses. If I threw you out of a speeding ice truck... and then ran over your head, you wouldn't be normal either. Think about this for a second. These bodies have been emptied... from a drug smuggler that just happens to own a mortuary. I got a bunch of bodies waiting with plenty of room in them... I could smuggle some shit. Johnny Tapia has the perfect cover. Johnny Tapia? I want a warrant to go into his mortuaries immediately. No warrant. What? For what? For what? For a bunch of dead guys on their way to med research? No. Every time we go after him, he sues us and wins. This shit stops now, or they'll fire us, disband TNT... and stick me in a fucking coffin. - This is over now! - What happened to ""whatever it takes""? That was pre-vehicular manslaughter. Not to mention Johnny Tapia - What the fuck is that? - Oh, shit. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. This man has violated my rights! Who the fuck is that? Running people over is not enough for you? Now you're into kidnapping? That man is a criminal. Okay? We busted him at the Excuse me, I have so much brass up my ass... I could be playing ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" I ain't cut out for this, man. Come on, man. I can't do this with you right now. - I'm re-evaluating what's important. - About what? Being a cop? No, about you being my partner. Is this about Syd? God! Hey, Marcus, man That was messed up, but that ain't what this is about, Mike. Once we nail Tapia, you and me, we're over. I already signed my transfer papers. Megan, what's the name of this boy taking you to the movies? Reggie. Daddy, please don't embarrass me and ask him a lot of questions. Everybody knows you're a cop, and it makes people nervous. Well, why nervous? He on crack? - It's cool? - Yeah. Come in. What'd you? I got a sneak and peek. Judge Sinclair said we can go into the mortuary tonight. We can't touch nothing, but if we find something... he'll give us a righteous warrant. You love pissing Captain Howard off, don't you? It's what I do. So when you start playing golf? Hey, so you real serious about this transfer thing, huh? I mean, you been quitting for 10 years. I just always thought it was... how you dealt with all this shit. It's what's best for me and my family. Look, I'm gonna get my stuff, man. ""We ride together, we die together. Bad boys for life."" We getting old, Mike. One of them young punks coming to take my baby out on her first date. - Who the fuck are you? - Hi, Mr. Burnett. I'm Reggie. - What you doing here? - I came to take out Megan. - What? - I came to take out Megan. - How old are you? - I'm 15, Mr. Burnett. Motherfucker, you look 30. - Show me some ID. - I don't have none on me. You don't have no ID. Get your ass up against that wall. What is your problem? You think you know it all. Little young Thundercats. - Got joints on you? - No. - You smoke that shit? - No, sir. You trying to get my daughter high? Do you smoke that shit? - Nigga, who that is at the door? - It's Reggie. - Who the fuck is Reggie? - Came to take Megan out. - What you want, nigga? - I'm here to take his daughter out. - What's your name? - Reggie. I heard the motherfucker say your name Reggie. You taking Megan out? - How old is you? - Fifteen. - Shit, nigga, you at least 30. - This is Mike. - Can you fight? - Yeah. You can fight? Motherfucker. You can't fight. Look at you - Cut it out. - I wanna know if When somebody taking my niece out, I wanna know if he can fight. Somebody might come say something, the nigga can't fight, she can't go. This is Megan's godfather, okay? He just got out the joint. Why you putting all my business in the street? - They call him - I got out of jail. I ain't going back! I ain't going back! What's wrong with you? Acting scared. You ain't seen a gun before? Stop pointing the gun at the boy. Look, don't you disrespect me in front of company. Let the gun go off. Nigga, you a big, tall, Ludacris-looking motherfucker, ain't you? - You rap? - No. Hey, Mike! Now, listen. Have my daughter home at 10:01. If she ain't home at 10:01, I'm in the car, okay? Lock, loaded and hunting your motherfucking ass down. - Do you hear me? Speak up. - I'll go with him. If I'm there, know what it'll be? Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, nigga. - That's what it'll be. - Marcus! Reggie, baby, I am so sorry. Forgive Megan's dad and his silly friend. - You a virgin? - Yes. Keep it that way. Ain't gonna be no fucking tonight. Baby, the red shirt's nice. You guys have a good time. - You ever made love to a man? - No. - You want to? - No, sir. - Hey, have a good time, baby. - Go. Go. - All right. - I need to go. That was cool. So, you ready to bust this case open? Oh, yeah. Let's finish strong. All right? All right, ladies. We cannot take a burn tonight or Tapia walks. I need a good, clean break-in. - Zank, eyeball. - Eyeball set. - Dex, high ground. - Rooftop set. - Fanuti, light your crack pipe. - Got you. Lockman, you buzzing? We're up, baby. - Hello, anybody home? - We got a stiff to deliver! - What's going on here, man? - We got a stiff to deliver. - Nobody told me about any stiff. - The guy's in the van now. He's fresh. No deliveries tonight. They told us to come right over to the place. This is the place. - We must bring him in here. I'm sorry. - No one in. - You get that body to the morgue yet? - Morgue? You said to get it to the Spanish Palms Mortuary. No, you dumb Latin fuck. What you smoking in that crack pipe? Who you calling a Latin fuck, man? Check. There's burnt people down here, Mike. Oh, fuck. Damn, somebody's teeth. Now that we're here, you need to sign some paperwork... because the man is very contagious. His contagiousness could touch you. You guys have a nice evening. Good night. Might you see us inside for some hot cocoa? Cam 1, I got a good signal. Cam 2, I got a good signal. - Damn! - Stop it. Do not do that tonight. - You don't smell that? - Oh, yeah, I smell it. - It stinks. - Stop! I'm gonna have some Pepto. - This dude hasn't been embalmed yet. - What you talking about? They stick a tube down your throat and just suck out all the gunk and bile. Because what happens is, your body will get gaseous, and you'll decompose. Don't want that to happen before your family see you. - I don't need to know that now. - They sew your mouth closed. They got to get it all out because a lot of times, dead people will fart.

Take it easy. Okay, thank you. Poison lady says we gotta keep him cool. Otherwise, he's burning up, he can get brain damage. Nobody will even notice that. Mike, I got an erection. - Take me home. - Hey. Call the wife, tell her I'm on the way. Hope you guys hear me. - We got her. Loud and clear. - She's in. Showtime. Palm Mortuary, Alpha team. Tapia's mansion, Delta. Dixie Boy boat dock, Bravo. Coast Guard gunships, anything that hits the water. We hit all three places simultaneously. Tac up at 08:45. We go hot at 09:00 sharp. Bring the noise. You're such a beautiful girl. Thank you. - Johnny. - Yeah? - Is she a Negro? - Please, Mama! Shut up! Get out of here! You make your bed, you sleep in it! Make way! - Get down! - Don't fucking move! You take risks. I like that. Or... maybe I'm the one taking a risk on you, huh? - Yeah? - Yeah. Excuse me, boss. We need to talk now. Something's going on outside. - Cops. - What the fuck do you mean, cops? Goddamn it. DEA. You don't plan on entering, do you? - We have a warrant to get in there. - A UC's inside. She's gotta leave first. You got two minutes. - Call her on her cell. - Yes, sir. Cut the power to the house. - You got her? Well, let's go. - No, sir. We got a bogey. God. This is for you, Josef, and me and Mother Russia. They're not gangbanger homeys. They're cops. Cops? They weren't trying to hit the load. I think they were looking after her. Now, you tell me... - where is the wire? - They made her. We gotta get her out. Go! Come on! Hey, Tapia, you fucking mother. The Russian Grim Reaper is here. Everything's in here. - Oh, shit. - Goddamn. Eyeball, has anything left this mortuary in the past two hours? A four-hearse funeral just left. We trailed them to Miami Harbour. Miami Air, Tapia's running his money to Cuba. Get us a chopper! Hey, Tapia! You scared of me, you little scumbag? - We got some heat. - Pull the car back. I'll fucking kill you! Who the hell are you? - Drop the weapon! - Drop the weapon now! - I'm with you guys! - Put it down, now! - I'm over here! - Shut up! - Drop the weapon! - I'll kill that son of a bitch! This is Alpha. Heads up to the Coast Guard Sharks and Bravo Team. Close the harbour. Freeze any moving speedboat. This is Bravo. We got a go-fast slinging a high rate of speed down Miami harbour. Stop that boat. This guy's moving us. Think we're going for the bridge. Coast Guard, we're going in. Miami Police. Shut it down. This is the police. Shut it down. - Watch out, he got a weapon. - Bail out! Coast Guard, take him down. Burn him. Vessel is dead in the water. Vessel is dead in the water. This is what we do. Oh, man, it's full up. It's full up. It's a righteous bust. How the hell they slip away? Give me the watch commander on the horn. Do you know her brother on Miami P.D.? Find him. Do you know anyone who might want to save your life? - Hello? - Marcus, they! You have $100 million of mine... and I want it back in 48 hours. Shit just got real. Jack Snell, DEA. Agent Eames, FBI... who has just informed me... that satellite pinpointed Tapia's jet in Cuban airspace 20 minutes ago. Cuba? United States does not negotiate with hostage-takers. Especially Cuban hostage-takers. It's a delicate situation. This is not just a situation. This is my sister. Off the record, all State Department agencies... are using their back-channel contacts for a diplomatic solution. You know, by the time y'all finish being diplomatic... my sister could be in a fucking box. This is bullshit. He ain't getting away from us that easy. We ride together... we die together. Bad boys for life. We just gotta do it ourselves, man. I don't know you. You look like you're about to do something stupid. I'm in. Dodd tell you how crazy us ex-Delta guys are? My brother, Tito, lives in Cuba. He's a little crazy, but he's hooked up with the underground. Weapons, men, a safe house. Whatever we need. You can forget about passports and all that stuff. Because if the Cubans catch us, we're all dead. My brother Tito's in Alpha 66, the Anti-Castro Underground. What does that have to do with Tapia? Everything. Tapia's the biggest supplier of drug cash to Castro. So Alpha 66 will be all over him. Brother, that is perfect. He says he can get men on the tunnel right away. Let me holler at him. Tito, we need layout, security, the whole deal. We got info that Tapia's got a casket coming in tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. Yeah, that might be our way in. Yeah. Brought you a little care package from my friends over at the CIA. They want to help. And don't ask me. They're spies. Former Delta Intel and Demo. Requesting permission to tag along. Ronnie, I hear there's a boat on fire off the coast of Cuba. Shouldn't we break international waters to help them? That's my dog. Point of no return. I wanna thank y'all from the bottom of my heart. - Mike, look, I just - Tell me when we get back. The target's in sight. I see the boat. Roger. Target 12 o'clock, 300 yards. Roper in the door. Stand by. Go! Go! Go! - Tito? - Welcome to Cuba. Damn. What's up with the safe house across the street from Tapia's crib? This is the last place anyone would look. We've been watching the place. Guards play soccer each day at 3:30. The bad news, everyone knows he uses the army like his bodyguards. - This is Tapia's compound. - CIA hooked us up, huh? Yeah. This LIDAR laser technology even shows his escape tunnel. The alarm security is wired to the army. We're screwed if we don't blow up this security room before we make a move. The tunnel we're digging branches off. One under his back yard and the other into his escape tunnel. We gotta hurry up. See? I told you my brother was a maniac. - How we looking? - Let me check it out. Papi, you look like Jesus. Why they call this The Last Supper? It was the last time they were all together before Jesus was crucified. Crucified? Hold your ears. Hey, you. Listen to me. This is fucking depressing! You understand? I mean, who had this fucking idea? I just want little angels looking down on me. Okay, here's the ocean, 300 yards from Tapia's house. We're here. Safe house. First tunnel comes through to here. First team takes out the security station. Second tunnel comes through into the centre of the house. Tito, your contacts inside said Syd's in the last bedroom... on the second floor, right? Lupe's one of us. If she says your sister's there... she is there. Three o'clock sharp, the bag of cats and iguanas go over the fence. Hopefully, the motion detectors will go so crazy, security will shut them off. My guys will watch the outside for any military. If they come, that's bad. Let's make this count, guys. We're in. Goddamn it, it's the fifth time today. Carlos, turn off the motion sensors till we get it fixed. - Look what I found. Can I keep them? - No. All right, guys... - sensors are down. Time to move. - We are 100 percent go. Let's go. Left. Left. Yeah. There we go. This is not as easy as it looks. Okay, we're at the T. Split right. Good luck, guys. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Find the soccer game. Sniff it out, baby. Sniff it out. To the left. To the left. Oh, shit. Oh, you did not see me. - Ready to bust into the escape tunnel. - There we go. Soccer. Sorry. Go, go, go! Go! Get me the American bitch. Call General Santos. Tell him I need him now! Sorry, darling. Take her outside to safety. Come on. - Carlos, this is not good! - I know! - Where is General Santos? - He's coming, boss! You fucking maricons! I'm gonna blow your head off! Fuck! What's happened to this gun? My son will slice you into chorizo. - Mama, I'm very sorry. - You little puta! - Vargas, you in? - We got Mama and the girl. We're entering the house. Go! Move! Move! Move! Everything's clear outside. You got 30 seconds max. Haul ass. You got two rovers on the balcony. I can't get a shot off. See the rover? I missed him! Get down! Get down now! - Get down! - Down! Move! Move! Move! - Marcus! - Come on! Move! We got the package. Move now. It's turning into a real bad day. - Vargas, we're coming back. Cover us! - We got you covered, baby. Somebody talk to me. What's going on? The military is everywhere. - This is bad, I have to go. - Listen, you have a lot of company. Get out of there now! I'm hit! I'm hit! Head for the tunnel. I'll blow this. Go, go! Get out! Mike, you gotta get out. Vargas! Get out! Abort! We won't reach the tunnel! Go to plan B. - We're going to plan B! - What plan B? You don't pay attention to shit! - What's the plan B? - That's your problem! Are you fucking shitting me? Let's go! - Follow me! Follow me! - I will Plan B? What the hell is plan B? - Tito, what you doing here? - You need a Cuban guide, fool. This way! - They won't make it to the tunnel. - Let's blow out of here! Keys, keys, keys! Oh, my God! No! God! Oh, my God! Plan B did not have that big-ass gun in it! You call this plan B? What the plan B stand for? Bullshit! Do you wanna drive? Yeah, pull over by the fuckers with the machine guns! Shit! Yeah. I am not to be fucked with! I missed the part of the meeting when you drive through the dining room. And right out the front door. Get in the truck! Cuban army was everywhere. - Gotta get us to Guantanamo Bay! - No. You can't drive onto a U.S. Naval base. Hey, we're Americans, okay? Marcus, you know how when we usually get in these situations... I'm always trying to make you feel better, like, ""We'll be all right."" - Yeah, yeah. - I could say it... but that'd be a bunch of bullshit today. Military, military. - Which way? - No, right! Right! Go right! These are drug-dealer shacks. They make cocaine here. Hope there's shit in there that likes to blow. Faster! I'll kill you, motherfucker! I'm gonna go for it. - This is a big-ass hill. - Shit. - Oh, shit! Is this still called plan B? - No, this is definitely plan C. Oh, Jesus! God! God! Everybody, start shooting at somebody! Shoot! Shoot! - Shit! I'm out! - I got two rounds left. - One in the chamber. - I'm out. All these guns, and none of you got no bullets? - I got one in my hip! - Oh, God, he's hit! There! Gitmo! U.S. soil, baby. U.S. soil. Come on! Go! - Americans on the way! - Whoa, watch Run it! Run it! Go. Go! Go! Go! Fuck. Mike! We're Americans! I pay my motherfucking taxes! Shoot them! Hey, fucking gringo. Drop the gun! Put it down! Put it down! They can't help you. You're staying in Cuba. You are standing on a live minefield! Do not move! Look, why don't we all go home Well, we'll go home, you go to a hotel. Work this shit out another day. None of us is having a good day right now. - Give me the gun! - Okay. I'll toss it right at your feet... right next to the mine. Now, that's how you supposed to shoot! From now on, that's how you shoot! Oh, I want my next partner to shoot just like that. It take a dysfunctional motherfucker to bust somebody in the head like that. That's some dysfunctional shit. My next partner willll invite me to his barbecues, though. Come here, girl. Come here. I came all the way to Cuba for this. Come on. Y'all gotta do that around the land mines? Would you tell them that that shit is dangerous around these land mines? You know, Mike, this ain't easy for me, but I was wrong. I'll be very proud for you to date my sister. - Thanks, man. - All right. You know, me and Syd thought about it... and your behaviour was so crazy that... any magic we could've captured, probably best if we didn't... You know. You're just gonna take advantage of my little sister? Already, you breaking her heart? - What you talking about? - She not good enough for you? Syd, Mike says you ain't shit! Now, why would you scream out some crazy nonsense like that? I don't appreciate you coming here, disrespecting me in my new pool. I bought your new pool. Why don't you hook this pool up to your Ferrari and drag it out of here? First of all, I was joking. And second of all, all this right here, smell yourself right now. Because this moment is what's wrong with you. I got the transfer papers in the trash can. I'll get them and glue them the fuck up. - Glue them up. - What? - Want some glue? - We won't be partners no more. I got glue in the car. I'm trying to talk to you. It's hot, I feel like I'm cooking in this fucker... and I gotta hear shit out of you? Then on top of that shit... you gonna dog my baby sister? Oh, this that bullshit! Dad! Dad! I kept the warranty. I kept the warranty! Bad boys, bad boys What you gonna do? What you gonna do When we come for you? Bad boys, bad Come on, you gotta learn the words. Mike, you don't know the damn words either. Bad boys, bad boys What you gonna do? What you gonna do When they come for you?, We come in peace for cats and mice everywhere. Hey, how you doing? Good to see you. Thanks for coming out. Itchy... Itchy... Boring! Dad, we can't see the movie. I can't believe we're paying to see something we get on TV for free. If you ask me, everybody in this theater is a giant sucker. Especially you. Especially you. Movie on the big screen! Excuse me. My heinie is dipping. All right, well, thanks a lot for coming. We've been playing for three and a half hours. Now we'd like just a minute of your time to say something about the environment. - You suck! - Shut up and play! - Preachy! - We're not being preachy. But the pollution in your lake, it's dissolving our barge. I thought they touched on a vital issue. I beg to differ. Gentlemen, it's been an honor playing with you tonight. For the latest rock band to die in our town... ...Lord, hear our prayer. Lord, hear our prayer. I hate being late. Well, I hate going. Why can't I worship the Lord in my own way... ...by praying like hell on my deathbed? Homer, they can hear you inside. Relax. Those pious morons are too busy talking to their phony-baloney God. How you doing? Peace be with you. Praise Jebus. Today I'd like to try something a little different. I'm going to call on one of you! Now, the word of God dwells within everyone. I want you to let that word out. Let your spirit... What is it, Ned? The good Lord is telling me to confess to something. Gay, gay, gay. An immodest sense of pride in our community. Somebody else? Let the Lord's light shine upon you. Feel the spirit. Let it out! Horrible, horrible things are going to happen! And they're gonna happen to you! And you! And you! And you. Whoa, nelly! People of Springfield, heed this warning: Twisted tail! A thousand eyes! Trapped forever! Dad, do something! This book doesn't have any answers! Beware! Beware! Time is short! Believe me! Believe me! Thanks for listening. Okay, who wants waffles? I do, I do, I do! Wait a minute. What about Grampa? - I want syrup! - I want strawberries! Something happened to that man. I'll tell you what happened to him. A certain someone had a senior moment. But that's okay, because we love him and we got a free rug out of it. What is the point of going to church every Sunday... ...when if someone we love has a genuine religious experience, we ignore it? Right, Grampa? I want bananas on my waffles. I rest my case. I'm not dropping this. Wait a minute. I'm still in the car. Oh, right. ""Take out hornets' nest."" Check. ""Fix sinkhole."" Check. ""Re-shingle roof""? Steady. Steady. Why, you little...! I'll teach you to laugh at something that's funny! You know, we are on the roof. We could have some fun. What kind of fun? How about a dare contest? That sounds fun. I dare you to... ...climb the TV antenna! - Piece of cake. - Earthquake! Aftershock! Homer, I don't mean to be a Nervous Pervis... ...but if he falls, couldn't that make your boy a paraplege-arino? Shut up, Flanders. - Yeah, shut up, Flanders. - Well said, boy. Steady. Steady. Steady... Hello. Sorry to bother you on a Sunday... ...but I'm sure you're as worried about the pollution in Lake Springfield as I am. Lake Springfield has higher levels of mercury than ev... Why, it's the little girl who saved my cat. Lake Springfield is... Come on over, Lisa. You can canvass me as long as you want. Milhouse, you don't care about the environment. Hey. I am very passionate about the planet. Say global warming is a myth. It's a myth! Further study is needed! That's for selling out your beliefs. Oh, poor Milhouse. Dream coming true. Are you aware that a leaky faucet can waste over...? Two thousand gallons a year. - Turning off lights can save... - Enough energy to power Pittsburgh. And if we kept our thermostats at 68 in winter... We'd be free from our dependency on foreign oil in 17 years. I'm Colin. I haven't seen you at school. Moved from Ireland. My dad's a musician. - Is he...? - He's not Bono. - I just thought, because you're Irish and... - He's not Bono. Do you play? Just piano, guitar, trumpet, drums and bass. He's pure gold. For once in your life, be cool. So is your name as pretty as your face? You okay there? Twisted tail! A thousand eyes! Trapped forever! What could that be? I believe it's the sound the Green Lantern made... ...when Sinestro threw him into a vat of acid. Yeah. Thanks for coming over. Thanks for giving me your pregnancy pants. Never known comfort like this. Why did I suggest this? All right, boy, time for the ultimate dare. I dare you to skateboard to Krusty Burger and back... ...naked. - How naked? - Fourth base. Girls might see my doodle. Oh, I see. Then I hereby declare you chicken for life. Every morning, you'll wake up to ""Good morning, chicken."" At your wedding, I'll sing: I like men now. Don't look where I'm pointing! Stop in the name of American squeamishness! Boys, before we eat, don't forget to thank the Lord for this bountiful... Penis?! - Bountiful penis. - Bountiful penis. Amen. Listen, kid, nobody likes wearing clothes in public, but, you know, it's the law. Lunchtime! You can't just leave me out here. Don't worry, we found a friend for you to play with. Nelson, honey, where have you been? - Dad! - What seems to be the problem, officers? Tell him you dared me to do it. If that's true, then you should be taking the rap here, not your son. And what happens to me if it's my fault? You'll have to attend a one-hour parenting class. It was all his idea! He's out of control, I tell you! I'm at my wits' end. It's so... See you in court, kid. Okay, son, let's get some lunch. Did you at least bring my clothes? Shirt, socks, everything you need. - You didn't bring my pants. - Who am I, Tommy Bahama? This is the worst day of my life. The worst day of your life so far. - Say, Bart? - What do you want, Flanders? If you need pants, I carry an extra pair. You know how boys are, always praying through the knees. Why are you helping me? I'm not your kid. We're neighbors. I'm sure your father would do the same for my boys. Thank you. - Hey, what's with you? - You really wanna know? Of course I do. What kind of a father wouldn't care about...? A pig wearing a hat! Action. Hey, hey! It's your old pal Krusty, for my new pork sandwich, the Klogger. If you can find a greasier sandwich, you're in Mexico! And we're clear. Perfect. Cut, print, kill the pig. What...?! You can't kill him if he's wearing people clothes! You're coming home with me. ""A thousand eyes."" What could that be? I'm pretty sure a thousand is a number. Hey, Marge. Isn't it great being married to someone who's recklessly impulsive? Actually, it's aged me horribly. Then say hello to the newest Simpson. Homer! I believe what happened in church was a warning about precisely this. Please, get rid of that pig. Oh, you're gonna love him. Look, he does an impression of you. You nailed her. He also does me. You smiled. I'm off the hook. Oh, you have so many looks. So that's what snug is. Who's a good pig? Who's a good pig? Rough day, huh, son? You don't know what rough is, sister. Bart, you know, whenever my boys bake up a batch of frownies... ...I take them fishing. Does your dad ever take you fishing? Dad, it's not fair to use a bug zapper to catch the fish. If you love fish like I do, you want them to die with dignity. I think I have a nibble. I think fishing might be more fun with you. Oh, great. Now, how about I fix you some cocoa? No way. Cocoa's for wusses. Well, sir, if you change your mind, it's on the windowsill. Oh, my God. Oh, wait. I didn't tell you the best part. He loves the environment. Oh, wait! I still didn't tell you the best part. He's got an Irish brogue. No, no, wait! I still didn't tell you the best part. He's not imaginary! Oh, honey, that's great. But the very best thing is that he listens to you. Because nothing means more than for a man to... How did the pig tracks get on the ceiling? Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig Does whatever a Spider-Pig does Can he swing from a web? No, he can't, he's a pig Look out He is the Spider-Pig Are we having fun yet? We are now. You've got a bite. Whoa, mama! Oh, no, my good pole! You're not strangling me. What the...? Strangling's only good for... Well, it's not good for anything. The only time you should lay hands on a boy... ...is to give him a good pat on the back. Hey, what the hell are you...? One more time. Honey, I'm home. We are at the tipping point, people. If we don't do something now... I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought. Isn't he dreamy? Agreed. Okay, so here's the bottom line: If we don't change our ways right now... ...pollution in Lake Springfield will be at this level. That's not so bad. No, the lift is stuck. Am I getting through to anyone? Hell, yeah. We need a new one of those things. All in favor of a new scissor lift, say ""aye."" - Aye. - No! This lake is just one piece of trash away from a toxic nightmare. But I knew you wouldn't listen. So I took the liberty of pouring water from the lake in all your drinking glasses. This is why we should hate kids. This is serious, people. No more dumping in the lake. I hereby declare a state of emergency. Code black. Black? That's the worst color there is. - No offense there, Carl. - I get it all the time. Sorry, sorry. No dumping in the lake. Fine. I will put my yard trimmings in a car compactor. Chief, I think there was a dead body in there. I thought that too, until he said ""yard trimmings."" You gotta learn to listen, Lou. Let us now make sure this barrier is completely idiot-proof. - Cletus. - Yessum? Try to dump something in the lake. Okay. I can't. I simply can't. - Brilliant. - Very effective. Don't get any ideas. Maybe we should kiss, just to break the tension. What's going on here? Nothing. Nothing. I'm not sure that pig should be in the house. And by the way, what are you doing with his leavings? Don't worry. I've devised a most elegant solution. It's leaking. It's not leaking, it's overflowing. He filled up the whole silo in just two days? Well, I helped. Homer, stop! Stop. I know it's easy for your mind to wander... ...but I want you to really concentrate on me. I can't escape the feeling that this is the crisis Grampa warned us about. You have to dispose of that waste properly. Okay, Marge. I will. You can take Spider-Pig with you. He's not Spider-Pig anymore, he's Harry Plopper. Hello. Homer, you gotta get over here. Health inspector shut down the doughnut store, they're giving out free doughnuts! Oh, my God, oh, my God! I just got one thing I gotta do first. Well, you better hurry. They're going fast. Whoa, that was close. Evil! Drive, drive, drive! Oh, right. Look at that. You can see the four states that border Springfield: Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky. Oh, yeah. And if you look real close, you can almost... Well, this certainly seems odd... ...but who am I to question the work of the Almighty? We thank you, Lord, for this mighty fine intelligent design. Good job. Jabbity, jabbity, jab, jab, jab! Hey! Jab one more eye and it's a federal crime. - Who are you? - Environmental Protection Agency. Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, here to see the president. Mr. President. Ja, that is me. Pollution in Springfield has reached crisis levels. I hate this job. Everything's ""crisis"" this and ""end of the world"" that. Nobody opens with a joke. I miss Danny De Vito. You want a joke, huh? Stop me if you've heard this one. Look at those angry eyes and giant teeth. It's like Christmas at the Kennedy compound. You know, sir, when you made me head of the EPA... ...you appointed one of the most successful men in America... ...to the least successful agency in government. And why did I take the job? Because I'm a rich man who wanted to give something back. Not the money, but something. So here is our chance to kick some ass for Mother Earth. - I'm listening. - Well, I've narrowed your choices down... ...to five unthinkable options. Each will cause untold misery... I pick number three. You don't wanna read them first? I was elected to lead, not to read. Number three! We're being sealed in a dome! What do I do? I don't know what to do! If I stay, I'm trapped. If I leave, I'm alone. Oh, God. In, out, in, out! I never saw Venice. ""Trapped forever."" It's all come true. That crazy old man in church was right. Dome! All right, men, open fire. Who's hurt? Raise your hands. Without the attitude. People, people. I have an important announcement. I have just perfected an acid-firing super-drill... ...which can cut through anything. - Hey, that's cool. It's right there. Just outside of the dome. What ruthless madmen could have done this to us? The United States government. My name is Russ Cargill and I'm head of the EPA. The what? - Environmental Protection Agency. - Come again? Look, I'm a man on a big TV. Just listen. - Springfield has become... - Springfield! - The most polluted city in the history of the planet. Drama queen! To keep your poisons from spreading... ... your government has sealed you in this dome. It's the last thing we wanted to do. I own the company that makes the dome, but that's beside the point. You mean we're trapped like rats? No, rats can't be trapped this easily. You're trapped like carrots. Wait. We couldn't be more polluted. Everyone stopped dumping in the lake. Apparently someone didn't get the message. Act natural. Hey, buddy, sooner or later, people are gonna discover this. Don't worry about that. We found a way to take you off the map. Coming up on your right: Nothing. This is Kent Brockman, reporting to you on a crisis so serious... ...it has its own name and theme music. The dome has put an end to life as we know it. The town is running low on supplies of everything from gasoline to Botox. Moment, please. Now, as always, we end our news on ""The Lighter Side."" It's the time of year when the swallows return to Springfield. I think the thing I miss most is a simple summer breeze. Maggie? We've got dome wax, dome polish, dome freshener, all your dome needs... ... at Dome Depot, located at the 105 and the dome. Dome Depot! Maggie got out! Maggie got out! Maggie was right there, just outside the dome. Marge, she's right here. This dome can play tricks on you. You just have to keep calm and... Oh, my God. I'm out of the dome. Fresh air! Freedom! I'll write you. Lead good lives! Good evening, this is Kent Brockman. Efforts to find out whose selfish crime... ... caused our entrapment have been fruitless. Until moments ago! A shocking discovery has been made here at Lake Springfield. That could be anybody's pig-crap silo. Homer, it was you. You single-handedly killed this town. I know. It's weird. Just a reminder, this station does not endorse vigilante justice. Unless it gets results. Which it will. You didn't listen to me after I warned you. Don't worry, nobody watches this stupid show. What's that ominous glow in the distance? Kill! Kill! Kill! Marge, look. Those idiots don't even know where we live. Kill! Kill! Kill! We want Homer! We want Homer! You monster. You monster! Did you see the news? Honey, come on, we have bigger problems. But I'm so angry. You're a woman. You can hold on to it forever. Okay. Homer, you have to go out there, face that mob... ...and apologize for what you did. I would, but I'm afraid if I open the door, they'll take all of you. No, we won't. We just want Homer! Well, maybe not you, but they'll kill Grampa. I'm part of the mob! Teeny! Take out the baby. Here, let me get that for you. Stay back. I got a chain saw. Bart! Crawl across. Hurry. But if they see you helping us, they'll kill you. I'm sure your father would do the same for... Point taken. Now, hustle your bustles. Archers. I'm using a red arrow so I know who I kill. No, Plopper. If you push that, Daddy will die. Hey, my luck's beginning to turn. Wait! There's something I have to get. - What'd you get? - Our wedding video. - We have a wedding video? - Torch his gas tank! We lost them. Up here. Get them! Get them! Little help? You know, the word ""apology""... ...is tossed around a lot these days, but when it comes from in here... Mom, what are we gonna do? Maggie, not now. We'll play later. The sinkhole. Follow me, kids! - Geronimo! - Sacajawea! So long, losers! The top of his head is still showing. Claw at it! Well, they're China's problem now. Colin! I can't hear you! I never thought my life would have an absolutely perfect moment, but this is... Lisa's got a boyfriend that she'll never see again! - Perfect. - What do we do? - Now we run. I'm afraid we lost them, sir. Damn it! Well, then, you find them and you get them back in the dome. And so nobody else gets out... ...I want roving death squads around the perimeter 24/7. I want 10,000 tough guys... ...and I want 10,000 soft guys to make the tough guys look tougher. And here's how I want them arranged: Tough, tough, soft, tough... ...soft, soft, tough, tough, soft, soft, tough, soft. Sir, I'm afraid you've gone mad with power. Of course. Ever try going mad without power? It's boring. No one listens to you. - Bart, are you drinking whiskey? - I'm troubled. - Bart. - I promise, I'll stop tomorrow. You'll stop right now. You come back here, little man. I miss Flanders. There, I said it! - Where's your father? - He went out. Let's quickly rebuild our lives while he's gone. Hey, guys? What's the secret knock, again? Look, I know I screwed up. This is big. It's huge! We're homeless! Our friends wanna kill us! Before we can even stay in the same room with you... ...I need to know what was going through your mind... ...when you didn't listen to me... ...and dumped that silo in the lake. Homer! I don't know what to tell you, Marge. I don't think about things. I respect people who do... ...but I just try to make the days not hurt until I get to crawl in next to you again. I mean, oh. Look, I'm really sorry. But I'm more than just sorry... ...I'm prepared with a solution. I've always been afraid I'd screw up our lives so badly we'd need a backup plan. And that plan is right here! No. Nope. Bingo. Bear with me. Alaska? Alaska. A place where you can't be too fat or too drunk. Where no one says things like: ""Let's see your high school equivalency certificate."" I don't know, Homie. I'm not saying it right. Look, the thing is, I can't start a new life alone. And I've really come to like you guys. I just don't see it. Marge, in every marriage, you get one chance to say: ""I need you to do this with me."" And there's only one answer when somebody says that. Okay, Homie, I'm with you. Thank you, my sweetheart. - Mom? - Yes, honey? You just bought another load of crap... ...from the world's fattest fertilizer salesman. You'll pay for ruining this golden family moment! Homer! How are we supposed to get to Alaska without any money? All right, son. If you don't believe in me, believe in America. America. Where any man can make quick money with no questions asked. Step right up and win my truck! All you have to do is conquer the Ball of Death. - What's the catch? - No catch. Just ride the motorcycle all the way around just one time. Three tries for $ 10. - Marge, how much money do we have? - Ten dollars. That counts as a try. That's two. And that's three. Here's what I'll do, because I like seeing you hurt yourself: I'll give you one on the house. - You're the best. - Dad! When you get to the top, don't slow down, speed up! - But that's when it's the scariest. - Just do it! Yes! Yay, Dad! I'll take that truck now. Oh, man. My wives are gonna kill me. Next stop, Alaska! Day 37 under the dome. We are facing intermittent power failures which... Okay, very funny. I'm gonna turn the lights off again. When they come back on, I want all my booze back the way it was. Yeah, okay. Okay. I'm very proud of you, Bart. Over 24 hours sober. - You are, aren't you? - I'll prove it. We're giving your father another chance, and we owe it to him to... - Oh, my God. - Can I help you? We need diapers. - Okay. - No. No, we don't. We don't. - Ladies' razorblades. - Right. No! No. No, we don't. I forgot, we're European. Just give us beef jerky. Lots and lots of beef jerky. That's right. That's what we need. That's all we came in for. Sure. Oh, my God. There they are! So you want some of my electricity, do you? Well, for once, the rich white man is in control. I have two buttons behind this desk. One will supply your town with power, the other releases the hounds. Reach me. Make me your brother. The hospital's generator is about to give out. Lives will be lost. ""Lives lost."" Go on. We got a convict we were gonna fry tomorrow, but now we can't. Tempting. Tempting. Look, all our reasons mean nothing. Just look into your heart and you'll find the answer. - First door on the right. - Thank you. What...? This isn't the way I pictured Alaska at all! Oh, that's better. Homer! Well, at least my poster didn't get torn. Welcome to Alaska. Here's $ 1000. Well, it's about time! But why? We pay every resident $ 1000... ...to allow oil companies to ravage our state's natural beauty. I'm home! Oh, thanks. What are you doing, Bart? Just passing the time. My boy loves Alaska so much, he's applauding it. - Lisa, why aren't you clapping? - But, Dad... Clap for Alaska! Well, Marge, we're separated from the kids by a wall of snow. All my dreams are coming true. We're going to need more birds. Day 93 under the dome. With necessities growing dangerously low... ...who knows what spark will set off this powder keg? - Let's discuss Tuesdays with Morrie. - Again? If we don't get a new book, I'm going to puke. You're the five people I'm going to meet in hell! We're out of coffee! I can't take another minute in this dome! Take that. Oh, no! Blowback! Look what they're doing to our dome. You know what that is, sir? - A crack? - Exactly. People got out of the dome before, they're gonna get out again. When they do, there's gonna be hearings, investigations... I'll have to go back to making family comedies. Don't worry, I have a solution for you, sir. In fact, I have five solutions. You don't have to read them. You'll have deniability. I'll take care of it. You know nothing. No. I need to know what I'm approving. Absolutely. But on the other hand, knowing things is overrated. Anyone can pick something when they know what it is. It takes real leadership to pick something you're clueless about. - Okay, I pick three. - Try again. - One. Five? - Go higher. Too high. - Three? - You said three. - Six? Two? - There is no six. Double it. - Four! - As you wish, sir. Are you tired of the same old Grand Canyon? Here we are, kids, the Grand Canyon. It's so old and boring. I want a new one. Now! Hello. I'm Tom Hanks. The U.S. Government has lost its credibility... ...so it's borrowing some of mine. Tousle my hair, Mr. Hanks. Sure thing, son. Now, I'm pleased to tell you all about the New Grand Canyon. This weekend. East of Shelbyville and south of Capitol City. That's where Springfield is! It's nowhere near where anything is or ever was. This is Tom Hanks, saying: If you're going to pick a government to trust, why not this one? Did you see that? Yes, they're going to destroy Springfield. But we're going to stop them. Homie, get your clothes on. Homie? I'm happy here. Screw Springfield! I can't believe you'd say something so selfish. Marge, those people chased us with pitchforks and torches. Torches! At 4 in the afternoon! - It was 7 at night. - It was during Access Hollywood. Which is on at 4 and 7. Dad, how can you turn your back on everyone who loved us? Flanders helped when we were in trouble. Who cares what he did? He's not your father. I wish he was. You don't mean that. You worship me. Oh, yeah? Look what I did to your picture. Look at it. How-dilly-doo-dilly. How-dilly-doo-dilly. Why, you little...! I'll strangle-angle you! Diddily-diddily. Bart, stop it! Leave this to me. Homer... ...in every marriage, you get one chance to say: ""I need you to do this with me."" That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Homer Simpson! We're saving Springfield! Listen to me, all of you. We are staying. We have a great life in Alaska... ...and we're never going back to America again. I have spoken! Well, I guess I've let her worry about me long enough. Marge? Kids? Okay, here goes. Homer... ... I've always stood up for you. When people point out your flaws... ... I always say: ""Well, sometimes you have to stand back to appreciate a work of art. "" Way back. Lately, what's keeping us together... ... is my ability to overlook everything you do. And I overlook these things because... Because? Well, that's the thing. I just don't know how to finish that sentence anymore. So I'm leaving with the kids to help Springfield... ... and we're never coming back. And to prove to myself that this is the end... ... I taped this over our wedding video. Goodbye, Homie. I love you. Marge? Kids? - So, Mom, what's our plan? - What are you doing up there? Looking through people's luggage. I'm the mascot of an evil corporation. Get down from there. We have to keep a low profile... ...till we get to Seattle to tell the world of the plot to destroy Springfield. I don't know if you guys should be talking so loud. Oh, Lisa, it's not like the government is listening to everybody's conversation. Hi, I'm calling about your Meat Lover's pizza. I like meat, but I don't know if I'm ready to love again. - You hang up first. - No, you hang up first. Okay. She hung up on me! But we're fugitives. We should just lay low till we get to Seattle. Hey, everybody, I found one! The government actually found someone we're looking for! Yeah, baby, yeah! Homer Simpson... ...do you know why you are here? Because my family cares more about other people than they do about me. Drink this liquid. More, please. Now we will cleanse your spirit... ...by the ancient Inuit art of throat singing. Throat singing? How long are we doing this? - Until you have an epiphany. - Okay. - Until you have an epiphany. - Okay. What's an epiphany? Sudden realization of great truth. Okay. Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig Does whatever a Spider-Pig does Look out! He's a Spider-Pig Unless you have an epiphany... ...you will spend the remainder of your days alone. Epiphany, epiphany, epiphany. Bananas are an excellent source of potassium. Americans will never embrace soccer? More than two shakes and it's playing with yourself? Hey, what are you doing? Oh, do whatever you want to me. I don't care about myself anymore. Because...? Because other people are just as important as me. Without them, I'm nothing. In order to save myself... ...I have to save Springfield! That's it! Isn't it? That was the most incredible experience of my life. And now to find my family, save my town and drop 10 pounds! Thank you, boob lady. This is it, kids. Seattle. Russ Cargill! Do you think he saw us? Yes, I did. Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Jump! Jump! Land! Land! Rest! Rest! Run! Run! Now, I know we've had a rough day... ...but I'm sure we can put all that behind us and... That's my whipping arm! Why does everything I whip leave me? Must keep going. Must keep going. No, I can't. I can't keep going. Yes, you can. No, I can't! Oh, shut up! You shut up. No, you. No, you. No, you. Oh, real mature. How could you say that? Oh, what's the point? It's hopeless. Don't give up, Homer. You are closer than you think. But which way do I go? Much obliged. Ten-hut! Lisa! Knock off that racket. Lisa! They captured my family. What do I do? What do I do? There's something strange about that ""sop"" sign. - Did you hear something? - Probably just a moth. I hope it's okay. Look, we can't keep stopping at every ""sop,"" ""yeld"" or ""one vay"" sign. Just move on. Let us out! Let us out! Stop that. You'll scratch your shackles. I hope I do. Oh, way to go, Bart. You stink. No, you stink. Springfield. I can't believe it, but it got even crappier. Oh, man. Oh, hi, Midge. Moe, what happened? With the town sealed off from the rest of the world, things got a little nutty here. Why are you dressed like that? Well, I don't like to brag, but I am now the emperor of Springfield. No, you're not! Yes, I am! Okay. Hail, emperor. Attention, Springfield. Your government realized that putting you inside this dome was a terrible mistake. Therefore, we're commencing with Operation Soaring Eagle. Which involves killing you all. As I speak, we're lowering a small but powerful bomb into your midst. Despite everything, I miss your father. Me too. His big, fat ass could shield us all. Ten-hut! At ease. I'm General Marriott Suites... ...and I have an urgent note from the president. It says to release this town immediately. Why is it written on a leaf? Perfect. Now Homer Simpson's gonna show he has cojones! Mom, I've gotta go find Colin. Not now, sweetie. Doomsday is family time. Hey. If one of us distracts Cargill, the rest of us can climb up that thing. Who'd be dumb enough to stay behind while we escape with our lives? My time to shine. Hey, Mr. Big TV Man, lookie here! What do you want? Look what I can do with my thumb. You wanna know how I do it? Four generations of inbreeding? I can smell fresh air. I can hear birds. I taste freedom. Excuse me! Watch out! Coming through! I was tricked by an idiot. Hey, I know how you feel. I was beat in tic-tac-toe by a chicken. Goodbye. Homer do good? Actually, you doomed us all. Again. Nice knowing you, Homer. But I... I can't do anything right. Get out of here! I've spent my entire life doing nothing but collecting comic books. And now there's only time to say: Life well spent! Okay, boys. When you meet Jesus, be sure to call him Mr. Christ. Will Buddha be there too? No. - Hey, Flanders. - Bart. How good to see you. And how terrible you're here. Thanks. Listen. I was just wondering if... ...before I died... ...I could pretend I had a father who... ...cared for me. Come here, son. There's always room for one more in the Flanders clan. Come on, bomb-disarming robot. You're our last hope. Red wire. Blue wire. Black is usually the ground. So much pressure. Pressure! He'd been talking about it, but I didn't take him seriously. Marge. Marge! Marge! Oh, no, the ""epipha-tree""! Hey, I tried my best. What am I supposed to do? But how am I supposed to get up there? Here. Buy yourself something nice. Homer? What the hell are you doing now? Risking my life to save people I hate... ...for reasons I don't quite understand. Gotta go! But first, one stop. Bart? Son? You think you could find it in your heart... ...to give your foolish old man one more chance? Oh, I don't know. It seems to me, son, that your father's saying that... ...he wants to spend his last minute with you. No. I can't do it. I want a father who's the same in the morning as he is at night. What's that word? - Consistency. - Consistency. Thanks, losers. Sorry, Homer. I'll let you hold the bomb. The man knows me. I wish Homer was my father. And I wish you didn't have the devil's curly hair. I've been taking your crap all my life! This feels good. No wonder you do it. Okay, you've only got one shot to throw that bomb through the hole. Dad, in case I miss... ...I'm sorry I said I wished you weren't my father. I don't blame you, son. I wasn't much of a father. Maybe it starts with the way my dad raised me. Yes. It's clear to me. It's just been one long, unbroken cycle of... Somebody throw the goddamn bomb! What? What's going on? We did it, boy! Dad? It's amazing no one was hurt. Bye, everybody. Now, that was a great father-son activity. Hello, Homer. So we meet at last, whoever you are. There's two things they don't teach you at Harvard Business School. How to cope with defeat, and how to handle a shotgun. I'm going to do both right now. Wait! If you kill my dad... ...you'll never know where the treasure is buried. What treasure? The Treasure of Imawiener. I'm a wiener? Classic. Well, always leave them laughing. Goodbye, sir. Maggie! What a great little accident you turned out to be. Colin? Colin! Lisa? Colin's dead. But his last words were: ""Milhouse, take care of Lisa. Hold her hand."" I got her all warmed up for you. Colin. Hi. - Hey, you wanna go...? - Clean up the lake? Well, I was gonna say get some ice cream, but okay. I like ice cream. Kind of sweaty. Sorry. Boy! You survived! How? I did things no dog should do. They will haunt me forever. I love you too. Best kiss of my life. Best kiss of your life so far. Steady. Steady. Steady. Dad? Thanks, boy. Steady. They've taken everything, sir. Smithers, I don't believe in suicide... ...but if you'd like to try it, it might cheer me up to watch. This is Tom Hanks, saying: If you see me in person, please, leave me be. Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig Does whatever a Spider-Pig does Can he swing from a web? No, he can't, he's a pig Look out! He is a Spider-Pig Look out! He is a Spider-Pig Come on, Dad, let's go. I've been holding it since they put the dome over the town. You can wait. A lot of people worked really hard on this film... ...and all they ask is for you to memorize their names. Well, I wanna make sure no animals were harmed... ...during the filming of this movie. Okay. Floor popcorn. Wait, wait, wait! It looks like Maggie has something to say. Oh, my God. Her first word. Sequel? Springfield doesn't have an anthem We thought we had one But we don't We paid a short guy to write it But we never saw him again The tune we stole from the French There's a few things they do well Like making love, wine and cheese Like Roqueforts, Camemberts and Bries Springfield, we're going to die Springfield, I'm scared, goodbye Assistant manager isn't all it's cracked up to be.

There's been a major toxic spill in the Shanghai factory district. We're staying on top of this developing story for you. We will bring you any new information as we get it.

Together, we form an alliance with the humans, a secret but brave squad of soldiers. All right, listen up. China's cover story on this one is ""toxic spill."" They had to evac the area for search and rescue. This makes six enemy contacts in eight months. We gotta make sure this one does not get out in the public eye, so keep it tight. A classified strike team called NEST. We hunt for what remains of our Decepticon foes hiding in different countries around the globe. Roll in Alpha through Echo now. Move out! Let's go! All right, Ironhide. We got echoes. They're close. Steel stacks at 2 o'clock. He's here. I smell him. It's close. It's getting closer. - Oh, no. - What have you got? Thermal ripple.

Why are you in such a hurry to get rid of me? - Did you rent the room out? - No, I got other ideas for your room and it rhymes with ""home theater."" Look what I found. It's your little baby booties. - Ma. - My little baby-bootie boy. - You can't go. - You see this, Dad? This is how you're supposed to react when the fruit of your loins goes out into the cruel world to fend for himself, okay? Yeah, my heart bleeds for you, pal. College, bummer! You have to come home every holiday, not just big ones. You have to come home for Halloween. Well, I can't come home for Halloween, Mom. - Well, then we'll come to you. - You're not coming. - No, we're not going anywhere. - We'll dress up. We'll be in costumes. You'll never know it's us. - You can't do that, Mom. - Would you let the kid breathe, for crying out loud? Come on. Go pack. There's no way you're packed for a month-long trip. Come on, chop, chop! Let's go. March, young lady. - Dad. - I love it when you call me ""young lady,"" - you dirty old man. - You ain't seen nothing yet. - Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa! - What? I'm watching what you're doing, Dad. It's not a rap video. It's just like a coach thing. That was a really creepy move just now, Dad. Look. You know, your mother and me are really proud of you. You're the first Witwicky ever to go to college. Now I'm crying again! This sucks! You're gonna be okay, Ma. You know, it's just going to be, you know, hard for her to accept that her boy's all grown up, you know, going out to handle the world on his own. - You okay, Pop? - Yeah. Mojo, no dominating Frankie! Get the hell off the couch, you filthy beasts! You'll see a lot of that in college, too. - What are you talking about, Dad? - There's gonna be a lot of women there. Yeah, well, I'm a one-woman kind of guy. Look, Mikaela's the greatest, but you gotta give each other room to grow, okay? You're no different than any other couple your age. Except we discovered an alien race together. How long you gonna be riding that scooter? Dad, listen, I know what the odds are. We're the exception, okay? Wait a second. Who could that be? In two weeks, it could be Muffy. Hey, beautiful. - I'm breaking up with you, Sam. - Really? You sure? I'm not hearing a lot of conviction. Well, I am, okay? So, there's no reason for me to come say good-bye to you. Wow, you almost sounded serious that time. Guess what? I made you a long-distance relationship kit. Yeah, I got you a webcam, so we can chat 24/7. All Witwicky, all the time. And I got you a couple souvenirs from the event that cannot be mentioned on cell phones. - Some mixes and candles and stuff. - Sounds cute. I can't wait. Hey! You want the infamous D-Day shirt? You kept your nasty, shredded clothes? Yeah. Of course, I kept it, Mikaela. It's like my Super Bowl jersey. I bled in this thing. - Wow. You're pretty confident, huh? - No, it's not that. It's just that my low self-esteem's at an all-time high. You think your little box of souvenirs is gonna keep me from leaving you? You really should come with me. They got cheap apartments near campus. Well, that's not gonna happen until I get my man-child father, fresh out of prison, back on his feet. I heard that. Where'd you put the clutch covers? - Next to the camshafts. - I love it when you say ""camshafts."" Whisper it to me. Camshafts. Why can't I hate you? It's my Witwicky charm. Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second. I guess we're not breaking up. I'll be over in 20. Mikaela, I think a sliver of the Cube got stuck on my shirt. Sam? There's a fire! Dad, we got a fire! Fire! Ron, did you know it was gonna be this hard? Can you just stop? Yeah, okay, I'll stop. You carry this shit! - Wow. - Do you know what? - What? - I don't want to go anywhere with you. I don't wanna go to France with you. I don't wanna go around the corner with you. - I'm going back inside. - All right, fine. I'll call you from Paris. What is all the racket? Sam? Dad! - What was that? - That's the whole kitchen! - Bumblebee... Oh, my... - Bumblebee! - Bumblebee! - Get in the garage. Go! - What the freak just happened? I'm about to have a nervous breakdown. Just go in the garage quietly, please. Holy Mother! - Oh, my God! - Whatever. Get in the garage now! - Firemen! Fire fighters, over here! - Dogs out! Get the dogs out! This is it! Come on, you guys. What are you waiting for? My house is on fire! ...very important. - What happened? Come here. Listen, I need you to take the Cube sliver and put it in your purse. - What's going on? - Just take it. - Sam Witwicky? A word with you. - Yes, Mom. Yeah. - Hi, Mikaela. I have a bald spot. - Hi. - An old furnace, I think. - From a waffle iron. When you go, he goes. I cannot live with a psychotic alien in my garage! Judy... National security. Look, if we stay quiet, they're gonna take care of everything. Just consider this the official start of our remodel, okay? Fine. If the government's paying, I want a pool and a hot tub! And I'm gonna skinny-dip and you can't say shit about it! - Yeah, you know you're in trouble. - He still having voice problems? He's playing it up. Bee, I want to talk to you about the college thing, okay? I'm so excited and I just can't hide it Hey, I'm not taking you with me. I'm gonna wait outside, okay? I meant to tell you about this earlier. It's just that, you know... Here's the thing. Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars. I know, and if it was up to me, I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee. Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't be living in my dad's garage. I mean, you're suffocating in here. You deserve better than this. This is hard enough, man. Don't make it harder. Can you just look at me, please? Come on, big guy. Look, the guardian thing is done. Okay? You did your job. Look, I'm safe now. You need to go be with Optimus Prime and the others. I just want to be normal, Bee. That's why I'm going to college, and I can't do that with you. It's not the last time I'm gonna see you, you know, Bee. Come on, don't do that. Bee. You're killing me, Bee. But you'll always be my first car. Love you, Bee. Wow! Between State Farm and the taxpayers, we're all taken care of. - You got dirt all over you. - Stop. Stop. - What? - Stop, I'm okay. Look. So, you think you can make it through those East Coast winters without me? You're the best thing to ever happen to me. - And? - And I'll do anything for you. And? - I think Sam's about to say the L-word. - Let's go, kiddo! Nice timing, Dad. I adore you. That's not the word that I want - to hear right now. - What are you talking about? It's the same word as the other word. - It's not the same word. - Look, if I say the other word now and you forced me to say it, it won't mean anything, plus you haven't said it either. So, don't get mad at me for not saying it. Yeah, but I haven't said it because guys always run when you say it first. Yeah, well, so do girls. Especially girls like you, with options. So, this is all part of your elaborate plan to keep me interested? - It can be. - I hate that it's working. Can I have a kiss? We're going to make it work, I promise. Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her. Retrieve it. Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three. Bad-ass ice-cream truck coming through. - Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello! - No, I don't... - Hold up. - Those are nice. Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time. Yes, sir. Yeah! Look here, it's my booty call right here! - Time to get my sexy on with the green. - Green? No, green is mine! I call green! - I got the green. - That hurt, man. It's supposed to hurt. It's an ass-kicking. Present arms! Director Galloway, what an honor. I'd love to show you around, but you gotta be on the classified access list. I am now. Presidential order, Major. I got a message for your classified space buddies! You guys made a mess of Shanghai. All right, so this is where we communicate with the JCS and this area serves as the Autobots' hangar. Secure link to JCS is up, Major. Secure line to the Pentagon is now open. - General? - Will, I saw the Shanghai op. - We had a rough day out there. - Yes, sir. We have intel that I believe warrants an immediate debrief. Now with your permission, I can't let you see him, but I would like you to hear from the leader of the Autobots. Proceed. You gotta wonder, if God made us in his image, who made him? General, our alliance has countermanded six Decepticon incursions this year, each on a different continent. They're clearly searching around the world for something, but last night's encounter came with a warning. ""The Fallen shall rise again."" ""The Fallen."" Meaning what? Origin unknown. The only recorded history of our race was contained within the AllSpark and lost with its destruction. Excuse me! With this so-called AllSpark now destroyed, why hasn't the enemy left the planet like you thought they would? Director Galloway, our National Security Advisor. The President just appointed him liaison. Well, I guess I didn't get that memo. Forgive the interruption, General. Excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier. After all the damage in Shanghai, the President is hard-pressed to say the job's getting done. Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot Cooperation Act, you agreed to share your intel with us, but not your advancements in weaponry. We've witnessed your human capacity for war. It would absolutely bring more harm than good. But who are you to judge what's best for us? With all due respect, we've been fighting side by side in the field for two years. We've shed blood, sweat and precious metal together. Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk. Don't tempt me. And the newest members of your team. - Easy. - I understand they arrived here after you sent a message into space, an open invitation to come to Earth, vetted by no one at the White House. Let me stop you right there, Mr. Galloway. It was vetted right here. And in my experience, the judgment of both Major Lennox and his team has always been above reproach. Well, be that as it may, General, it is the position of the President that when our national security is at stake, no one is above reproach. Now, what do we know so far? We know that the enemy leader, classified NBE One, aka Megatron, is rusting in peace at the bottom of the Laurentian Abyssal, surrounded by SOSUS detection nets and a full-time submarine surveillance. We also know that the only remaining piece of your alien AllSpark is locked in an electromagnetic vault here on one of the most secure naval bases in the world. Decepticons, we have located the shard. And since no one can seem to tell me what the enemy is now after, well, there's only one clear conclusion! You! The Autobots! They're here to hunt you! What's there to hunt for on Earth besides that? ""The Fallen shall rise again""? It sounds to me like something's coming. So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude that our national security is best served by denying you further asylum on our planet, will you leave peacefully? Freedom is your right. If you make that request, we will honor it. But before your President decides, please ask him this. What if we leave and you're wrong? That's a good question. Oh, my gosh! Look at this place! I feel smarter already. - Ron, can you smell it? - Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year. - Hey, cheapo! - Hey, go ahead. We'll get your stuff. Just go ahead and check out your room. Yeah, go. - Hey. - Hey. - You must be Sam, right? I'm Leo. - Hey. So, I already set up the crib a bit. You want this side or that side? - That side. - I already chose that side. You know what this is? This is the awkward moment. Yeah, see, you're trying to see if I'm a normal guy. I'm trying to see if you're a normal guy. Balanced, unmedicated, nothing under the crawl space. Good personal hygiene, won't stab me in my sleep. No criminal record, won't steal anything. - Including girlfriends. - Especially girlfriends. - You got a girlfriend? - I do. You? No, not a chance. You a techie? Sweet! Sharsky, Fassbinder, where we at? - Server's almost online, Leo. - Network's up and running. Beautiful, that's what I like to hear. That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder, my IT gurus. Welcome to my empire, bro, TheRealEffingDeal. Com. That's me, I'm sure you've heard of it. - No, I haven't. - Well, that sucks. - What is all this for? - See where I'm going, bro. Look, call me gross, I want to be a baby billionaire. Kitten calendars. That's where I started. Look at me now. Got to have dreams, bro. Leo! We got some brand-new Shanghai vid! Post it, baby! Go, go, go! FTJ! FTJ! - What's ""FTJ""? - ""Fuel the Jet."" Fuel the Jet, bro. FTJ. FTJ, legit! Did you see that? Did you see that? Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets wrecked and China says ""gas leak."" Don't believe the hype, bro. Just like the alien robots in LA two years ago that everyone covered up. Yeah, I saw these robots, and they did this, like, firing thing and they came down and toasted this woman, and she was like... - It looks fake to me. - Dude, it's not fake. The Internet is pure truth. Video doesn't lie. - It looks fake. - No, man, I've seen them. - They're, like, these robots... - Look, look, it's fake. Anybody could do it on any computer, okay? And I wasn't there, - so I can't comment or speculate. - No. ""Comment or speculate""? And we're supposed to cohabitate? No, listen, okay? Don't be sucking the sack, bro! - Which sack? - The ball sack. Dude, what kind of tool are you? Mainstream media sack. They're lying to us, all right? - It's aliens, man. - Okay, okay. Follow me. Leo, bad news! We just got scooped. The video's already up on GFR. Fassbinder! Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main competition on conspiracy stuff. ""Effing"" was my F-ing idea and he stole it! He's been linking to my site and thieving hits forever. By the way, I read your file. I'm poor, you're poor. We're gonna fix that, all right? You work for me now. I work for you now? That's incredible. It's first day of college, I got a career in a dinky Internet firm with a boss who is made up of just pure champion stuff. Are you mocking my life's work, Samuel? That's your one warning patrolling, dude. Don't make me have Fassbinder hack your financial aid, 'cause I'll do it! Hey, RA. Listen, it's getting a little intense in my room. Can I switch out? Sad face, 312. No switching, no trading. Let's turn that frown upside down, okay? - Oh, here we go. - We made it. Hi. It's just like Hogwarts. - Hi. - Is this co-ed? This is a co-ed dorm. - You guys want to meet my roommates? - Yeah. Some real swell guys. - Here's Leo. - We're the Witwickys. - I'm Leo. - I'm Judy. Hey, you have a great son, you really do. - Well, aren't you the sweetest thing? - Yeah, he's real sweet, Ma. What is that in your hand, by the way? I got this at the bake sale for the environment that those boys are having. You know, you don't often see white boys with the dreadlocks. - Mom? - Yeah, it's 100% pure, Hawaiian green for the environment. - How many of these have you eaten? - Drop it. - What is this? - Yeah, they baked it with reefer in it. - No, it's... - Please, give me... Hey! It's my cheat day. I can eat what I want. I'm going to freak out. Please do something right now, Dad. Please do something right now. I can eat all the fricking brownies I want! Come on, let's go. I'm sorry and you're welcome. We call it the ""Hot Freshman 55."" Sharsky hacked Campus Housing and stacked the dorm with pretty Betties. Is... Is so nice... Oh, my God. That's her. She's coming. She sees me, she sees me. She's tied for number one on my to-do list. Do not bird-dog my quail, you hear me? Pretty girls! Hey, you. My son lives in this dorm. You should go make friends with him. He's Sam. Glad she ain't my mama! And he recently had his cherry popped! He didn't know I was in the house! I heard it all! - Hey! Hey! Hey! - Here he is! He would get in my closet and dress up as Boy Spice! - Hey, and his car is a talking robot! - No, like the GPS. OnStar! - OnStar. - Frisbee! No, Dad! Dad, you just gonna let her run around the school? - Give it! Mine, mine, mine! - Hey! Crazy! - You want it? - I want it. Judy, Judy, just... Just put it down. - You gotta control your mother. - I don't know who this woman is. Hey, Professor, I'd do anything for an A. All right, Grace Slick. We got some snacks in the car. Let's go. - Did you get the booties? All right. - Yes, Dad, I got the booties! I'm upside down! Black Lion X-Ray, this is Black Lion Tango. We have activation of motion sensors on the western perimeter fence. Breach at B-14. Go, go, go, go! The shard's gone. Contact! Take it down! - Which way? - Shoot left! Knock it down! First frat party's the game changer. Boys, we're hunting in the wild now. So, get your game faces on. I can't stay long. I have a webcam date with my girlfriend. - That's so cool! - No, it's not. While he's making out with his MacBook, I'm gonna be getting my Spitzy freaky freak on. - Let's roll. - She's hot. Bro, we're hunting! - See you, darling. - Bye, Dad. Okay. This is our first live chat date. I've never done it before. I'm kind of nervous. - Are you okay? - No. I was getting a napkin for my drink. Thanks. Cheers. - It's Sam, right? - Yeah. - I wanna dance. - What, like... Like dancing? Like a pairing? Like a duo? Like a coupling? 'Cause I'm in a permanently semi... I'm in a relationship, kind of... - Relax. I just want to have some fun. - Wanna have some fun? Yeah, okay. Let's play some checkers. You can sit over there and... Oh, my... So, how about tonight you pretend I'm your girlfriend and I pretend that you're my boyfriend? Hey! Who drove the freaking yellow Camaro? There is a car on the lawn! What are you doing? Houston, we have a problem. - What is it? - Freshman! - Yeah? - Is that your car in our bushes? No, there's a friend of mine, he just went to get you a tighter shirt. There isn't a tighter shirt! We checked. Now how about I park my foot in your ass? - What size shoe do you wear? - Yeah? - Hold on. - You wanna try? - I'll back it up right now. - Get him out of here. You have a ride? Bro, why are you holding out on us? I've only known you 17 hours. This is gonna really change our lives. You have no idea. - I love Camaros. - I can't do this right now, okay? - Don't be a wimp. - Oh, God! - My first car was my dad's '92 Z28. - Yeah? Fuel-injected. The roar of the engine, it just tickles me. We shouldn't stare... I mean, share stories with each other at all. Come on, Sam. Just one ride. Your cheatin' heart Don't. Don't! She's a super freak, super freak She's super freaky - Is your radio broken? - No, my concentration is. We're not cheating. Not yet. Is something wrong here? God! You okay? She's mighty, mighty I really don't know what to tell you. This car has a lot of problems. A lot... Oh, God! It's in my mouth! Are you okay? I got Wetnaps. I got Wetnaps for your face! Hold on! I... I'm so sorry! What are you doing? You won't give me a day, huh? - You won't give me one day in college? - I'm sorry, Sam, but the last fragment of the AllSpark was stolen. Like what? Like Decepticons stole it? We placed it under human protection at your government's request, but I'm here for your help, Sam, because your leaders believe we brought vengeance upon your planet. Perhaps they are right. That is why they must be reminded by another human of the trust we share. - This isn't my war. - Not yet, but I fear it soon will be. Your world must not share the same fate as Cybertron. Whole generations lost. I know, and I want to help you, I do, but I am not some alien ambassador, you know? I'm a normal kid with normal problems. I am where I'm supposed to be. I'm sorry. I... I really am. Sam, fate rarely calls upon us at a moment of our choosing. You're Optimus Prime. You don't need me. We do, more than you know. Conn, Sonar. Gained new contact, bearing 214, and possible hostile, confirmed for Project Deep Six Drop Point. - What do you got? - SU pulled five contacts at 5,000 feet, diving fast. Never seen anything dive that deep that fast. - Man battle stations. - Chief of the watch, man battle stations! Helm, left full rudder, all ahead two-thirds. - Left full rudder, two-thirds. - Dive, go deep. The nets protecting NBE One are screaming, sir. That is 9,300 fathoms down. And no confirmed DSRVs on site? - None, sir. - Then, people, we've got a problem! Need parts! Kill the little one! The shard make Energon! Conn, Sonar. Now hold six contacts, and they're coming up fast! - Sound collision alarm. - Left hard rudder. Five hundred feet. Angel Six, we got six hostiles coming up. - Collision imminent port side. - One hundred feet. Brace for impact. Starscream, I'm home. Lord Megatron, I was so relieved to hear of your resurrection. You left me to die on that pathetic insect planet. Only to help spawn our new army. The Fallen decrees it! After all, in your absence, someone had to take command. - So disappointing. - Hatchlings! Hatchlings! Careful, fragile! Even in death, there is no command but mine. My master, I failed you on Earth. The AllSpark is destroyed and without it, our race will perish. You have much to learn, my disciple. The Cube was merely a vessel. Its power, its knowledge, can never be destroyed. - It can only transform. - How is that possible? It has been absorbed by the human child. The key to saving our race now lies within his mind. Well, then, let me strip the very flesh from his body! And you will, my apprentice, in time. For millennia, I have dreamed of my return to that wretched planet where I, too, was once betrayed by the Primes I called my brothers. Only a Prime can defeat me, and now, only one remains. Optimus! He protects the boy. Then the boy will lead us to him - and revenge will be ours. - Yes. The boy will not escape us. We have him in our sights. Without more Energon, the hatchlings will keep dying. Space. Time. Gravity. - Thank you. - Finish that for me. We're going on a journey together, you and I, today. All you eager, nubile, young minds on the very cusp of adulthood. And I shall be your consort, your guide, your chaperone, into the heart of darkness. Welcome to Astronomy 101. For what do we know about the stars? Virgo, the virgin. Orion, the great hunter. These are no mere twinkling diamonds for lovely maidens to wish upon. No, they are dynamos filled with a throbbing, savage and pent-up energy! Behold the work of Albert Einstein, a professor once, like moi. - Energy equals mass... - What you doing? Put your hand down. Put your hand down. Young man, there are no questions until I've reached the climax of my lecture. I just finished your book and there's only one problem. Einstein's wrong. Energy does equal mass times the velocity of light squared in this dimension, but what about the other 17? Nobody ever talks about the other 17. Clear example. Break down the elemental components of Energon, assume a constant decay rate and extrapolate for each of the... Fourteen galactic convergences it took the Sentinel Prime expedition to receive an... Echo on its signal, you wind up with a formula for inter-dimensional energy increase that mass and light alone can't possibly explain. Come on, guys, I can't be the only one in the class who... Young man, I will not be punk'd in front of the dean. No, this is my universe here. Do you understand? I am the alpha and the omega. - Get out of my class! - Yes, sir. Anyone else care to have some sort of mental breakdown? Hi, Bones! Hi. Hi. You're such a good boy. What a good boy, you are. Hey, Bones. Are you hungry? Come on, check that out. There you go. - Yes, Samuel? - Hello? Mikaela? I can't believe you're gonna stand me up on our first web chat date. - Something just happened to me, okay? - What, you finally hit puberty? No, no, no. Stop laughing. This is serious. Okay. Remember I was telling you about my great-great-grandfather, Archibald Witwicky? Remember? Watch it, watch it, watch... No! Okay, remember how I was telling you... Okay. Can you stop? Watch the foot! Watch your foot! Mikaela, okay, my great-great-grandfather went on this Arctic mission, right? And he saw Megatron. Megatron zapped him, and he started seeing these crazy symbols. Okay. Well, now I'm seeing them, too. Excuse me. I just read a 903-page astronomy book in 32.6 seconds. I had a meltdown in the middle of my class. I am seeing symbols ever since I... - Since what? - Ever since I touched the Cube splinter. - Do you have it? - Yeah, I have it. - It's in the shop safe. It's fine. - Mikaela, do not touch it, okay? - Don't touch it. - I'm not gonna touch it. Sam, it's fine. It's locked away. - No one knows where it is. - I do! You're hot, but you ain't too bright. There we go. Yeah, that'll work. Damn it! Son of a bitch! What are you looking at, slobber puss? What the... This place is a freaking house of horrors! Pain... It hurts... Hold on. Right to five, then... Is that the best you got, huh? Is that the best you can do? What are you doing here, you little freak? That's my eye, you crazy bitch! - You gonna talk now? - I seek knowledge from the Cube. - The Fallen demands me! - What knowledge? You got the shard, I need the shard. Give me the shard. I need the shard. They're gonna whack me! I'm gonna be dead without that shard! Easy, warrior goddess, I'm just a little salvage-scrap drone! - And I'm your worst nightmare. - Hey, hey, hey! - What the hell was that? - I'll tell you later, just not on an open phone line, okay? I'm gonna get on a plane right now and I'll be there later this afternoon. Just be careful, Sam. And have any strangers given you anything suspicious to carry on today? Yeah, a live bomb! - No. - Good. Major, incoming SOS from Autobots! Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion. Vicinity, eastern United States, sir! - As in how many? - Unclear, sir. Well, get clear. The Autobots are on the move, splitting into two teams, sir. They're not answering our calls and they're heading to New York and Philadelphia. All right, full weapons deployment. Wheels up in 20 minutes! Move it! Let's go! Flight 57, welcome to Philadelphia. Alicia, mi amor, can I interest you in an 18-inch Zookeeper's special? Extra-large, triple cheese, with every known animal as a topping. Basically, I've got, like, 18 inches of meat. Unless you're vegetarian. All right. It's cool. I am, too. - Sam home? - Sam? I think he died, but why don't we check? - Here we are. - Hey! You ever have a song stuck in your head? It's like the worst song ever, but you can't help to whistle it or sing it 'cause it, like, repeats itself, repeats itself, repeats itself, repeats itself? Kitten calendar, kitten calendar, kitten calendar, - kitten calendar... - Dude, what the eff? I know you're freaking out. Don't freak out. Don't freak out. Easy fix. Puzzle code in my head. Now it's on the walls. Everything is good. This is the part that... Okay, what were you saying? Alice, I'm horrified you had to see this. Let's go. Get out. Wait, wait, wait! Can I just sit and watch? I'll... I'll eat my pizza quietly. Sam, I knew there was something special about you. Really? And I know you know what happens when two people in the know get together. They're genuinely amazing in bed. Thank you. All right, listen, hold on! Boundaries. - Flag on the play. Okay. I'm very ticklish. - We have needs, Sam. Relax. Jeez! What about this economy? It's crazy, isn't it? - You are very aggressive. - Just relax. You want some turkey meatloaf? Sam? - Mikaela! - Is that your girlfriend? Ex. Mikaela! Wait! I can explain... Sam, your bed buddy, Alice... All right, come on. - She's coming! - She's an alien robot! You gotta move. - Is this real? - Just run! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I can't believe I almost had sex with her in my dream! I can tell that you really missed me a lot, Sam! - Look, it's not my fault, okay? - It's not your fault? Listen! Listen, I'm a victim! - You were a victim? Of what? - Yeah. - Of what, a little 80-pound girl? - Of... Of molestation. It was like getting humped in the neck by a mountain ox! You didn't have to put your tongue in her mouth! - I didn't! Look! - You did! You ever had your stomach tongued by a mountain ox with a five-foot tongue? It's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela? And it smelled like... Like diesel! - Like a diesel-y tinge to it! - You're such a little girl! We're gonna have 10 seconds of silence right now. I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds. You can't give me the silent treatment! You know what? I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds. You have three seconds left. You know what? You can give me the silent treatment all you want, but you can't keep me from talking. - What were you gonna say? - I hope you had a lot of fun, because this, this is over. She violated your orifice with her nasty alien probe? She did it? She went in there? All her little embryo alien babies are gestating and hatching inside of you. They're growing right now, probably! You need to vomit it right now. Yak it! Yak it right now! Who are you? I'm Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz. Okay? I'm the key to this. The aliens, they want me 'cause of my site. Whoa, guys, right there! Run! Mikaela! Come on! We gotta move! It's a bomb! You've got to get that box! - This way. - What? Hey! Let me out, let me out! Oh, my God, you know how to hot-wire a car? That's so hot! Drive, drive, drive! She's right there! She's right there! Come on, come on, come on. Go! Go! Go! Back up the car! Now! Tongue! Oh, my God! Kiss this, bitch! Drive, drive, drive. Okay, so what else don't I know, all right? Since you guys forgot to mention some minor details. That thing you saw back there, that was the little baby... - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Sam! Sam! - Sam! - Hold on! - Pull me up! - Hold on! Sam, get back in! I don't want to die! We're gonna die! Oh, my God! Jesus! Jesus! Come here, boy. Closer. - Oh, my God. - Okay. You remember me, don't you? I did what you said, okay? Just don't hurt us. Shut up! Sam! Yeah! Yes, yes. It feels good to grab your flesh! I am going to kill you slowly, painfully, but first, we have some delicate work to do. How I could snap your limbs off! Doctor, examine this alien specimen. I'll scan you. Let's take a look at your face. I'm the doctor. The odd job. Information! Yeah! Beseeching my shard! Easy or tough way? - There they are. - That's what I'm seeing in my head. These symbols can lead us to the Energon source. We must have the brain on the table! - Chop, chop! - Brain? What does he mean by my brain? Well, you have something on your mind, something I need. Hold on. I know you're pissed. I know you're pissed because I tried to kill you and it's completely understandable. If somebody tried to kill me, I'd be upset, too. I think that we have an opportunity here to start anew and develop our relationship and see where it leads us, okay? So, you just call Doctor Inspector off and let's just talk for five seconds! Wait, wait, wait! - Come on! Go, go! - Sam! Go, go, go! Sam! Run! Go, go, go, go! Here he comes! Hide, Sam! Weak! Puny! Waste of metal! Junkyard crap! Decepticons! Come here, boy. There is another source of Energon hidden on this planet. The boy could lead us to it. Optimus! Is the future of our race not worth a single human life? - Up! Get up! - You'll never stop at one! I'll take you all on! Piece of tin! Sam! Where are you? No! You're so weak! The last Prime is dead! Sam, run. Run. Autobots, attack! Bumblebee, get them out of here! This is Lennox. - That went well. - We've lost the boy, Master. The Autobots must be shielding their signals. I can't even rely on you to swat a simple insect? - One insect among seven billion! - Shut up! He could be anywhere. Then we will force them to find him for us! It's time for the world to know of our presence. No more disguises. No mercy! The time has come for my master's arrival. Decepticons, mobilize. It is time. Speaking French is so exciting! Oh, God, who is this? Hello? I mean, bonsoir! - What? Who is this? - Where is the boy? For Pete's sakes. I'm not impressed with your perverted mouth-breathing. Jeez! You are invading my space. I'm gonna have to drop you. Would you get out of here? I didn't come all the way across the ocean to eat a plate of snails. I want to try new things. Looks like Canadian goose poop. It's nasty. Revenge is mine. Yeah! ...definitely not a plane... Look, carriers don't just sink. ...a horrible accident or a terrorist attack or worse... Negative. NORAD confirmed, projectile came from beyond our atmosphere, inbound at 30,000 knots. Citizens of the human hive, your leaders have withheld the truth. You are not alone in this universe. We have lived among you, hidden, but no more. As you've seen, we can destroy your cities at will, unless you turn over this boy. If you resist us, we will destroy the world as you know it. What we're hearing from the German government is that the world broadcast was a satellite hacking. The military has just told us they have assumed Condition Delta, which is the highest level we have been at since 9/11. President Obama is being flown to a bunker somewhere in the middle of the United States in the face of the worst simultaneous attacks ever around the globe. The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt goes down off the East Coast, all hands lost. Worldwide casualties are in the neighborhood of 7,000, but that number could climb. It's still too early to tell. What we need to ask now is, ""Who and why?"" The FBI is still trying to locate the boy, Sam Witwicky. We believe they have information about the attacks. The FBI, CIA and Interpol are all seeking the cooperation of worldwide law enforcement. You need to listen to this, man. You gotta check this out. - They have a traffic-camera spotting... - They have a picture of me, man. We're dead, bro. FBI, CIA, we are wanted fugitives now! I just need you to focus - for one minute, man. - Just stop. This thing has blown up to a whole other level, all right? You know what? Give me this thing. They can track us. - Do you see this? - What? They can track us? Like, satellite track us? Okay, I'm not even with you guys! Technically, I'm like a hostage. This is kidnapping... - Enough is... - Yo, Leo! This thing's gonna give me a heart attack, I swear. - That's 'cause you is a wuss. - You guys forced me into that car, right? I think he's scared. Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do with this shrimp taco? Let's pop a cap in his ass, throw him in the trunk and then nobody gonna know nothing, know what I mean? - Not in my trunk. - Yo, bumper cars? I'm hearing you. Okay? I'm right here and I can hear you! No one's popping any caps in any asses, okay? I've had a hell of a day! Why don't you get a haircut with your bitch ass? Go whine to your boyfriend! Listen, Sam, I know what I'm gonna do, man. Look, I'm just going to go to the authorities and tell them the truth. Like, I had nothing to do with this. - So, I'm not an accomplice. - Hey, you wanted this, right? You wanted the real deal? Well, that's what this is. Wake up! You're in the middle of it! You want to run? Go ahead! No one's stopping you. Stop complaining. What is the meaning of this? You dare point a gun at me? You want a piece of me? I will tear you apart! Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons! - Tell them to lower their weapons! - Tell them first. Tell them to lower their weapons. Major, there's nothing I can do. Talk to him. Your NEST team is deactivated, Major. You are to cease anti-Decepticon operations and return to Diego Garcia pending further orders. No, we take our orders directly from Chairman Morshower, sir. Well, I'll see your Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I will raise you a President of the United States. I have operational command now. An alien blood feud has been brought to our shores for which our soldiers are paying the price. The secret is out! This is our war now and we will win it as we always have, with a coordinated military strategy. This fool is terribly misinformed. You're gonna need every asset that you've got. What we need is to draw up battle plans while we explore every possible diplomatic solution. Like what, handing over the kid? All options are being considered. Whatever the Decepticons are after, this is just the start. - There is no negotiating with them. - I'm ordering you to stand down. You won't be needing this anymore. Get your assets back to base! And take that pile of scrap metal back to Diego Garcia. Let's go! I really don't like that dude. He's an asshole. Autobots, report to hangar for transport. - Ironhide, we should leave this planet. - That's not what Optimus would want. There's nothing that you could have done. - You okay? - Yeah. Bee, if you hate me, I understand. I messed up. I'm sorry. Young fella, you are the person I care about most in my life. If there's anything you need, I won't be far away. He's dead because of me. He came here to protect me and he's dead. There's some things you just can't change. So, his sacrifice for us would not have been in vain. Hallelujah! I'm gonna make it right. I'm going to turn myself in. We... We've got to stick together. - You're not going to do that. - Yes, I am. Everything we worked for will be wiped out in one day! - You two... - Huh? Hey, you know the glyphs? These? The symbols that have been rattling around in my head? That's old school, yo. That's, like... That's Cybertronian. That's some serious stuff, right there. They gotta mean something, like a message or like a map. Like a map to an Energon source! - Can you read this? - Read? No. We don't really do much reading. Not so much. If you can't read it, we gotta find somebody who can. Look who came sashaying back! Hair growing like a Chia Pet. Look at him. I had a bit of a mild panic attack earlier, right? That's 'cause you're a pussy. I think I'm allowed that, considering what I've been through. I heard you have a problem. - I think I know someone who can help. - Who? Robo-Warrior. This guy, Robo-Warrior, everything about anything alien, he's supposed to know. One time we revenge-hacked his site and maybe I saw some of your alien drawings or whatever. This is it. Yep. Deli. Good front! All right, wait here. I'll give you the go/no go. All right? Number 42, we got your kishka, knish, kasha-varnishka and kreplach combo right here. Cash only. Who's next? I told you to cure the lox in the brine and then smoke it. Ma, you want me to cut my hand off, or what? You... You ruined a beautiful piece of fish, you retard! I'm like a ninja with a blade. It's an art form. Give me your money. Get out of here! Hey, Sal! Watch your reach, huh? Take a number, young man. Robo-Warrior. - Know him? - I never heard of him. You never heard of TheRealEffingDeal. Com? You must be talking about that amateur-hour blog operation - with Game Boy-level security. - Robo-Warrior. It's him! It's him! That's the guy right there! That's him! No. - You got to be kidding me. - All right, meat store's closed! - Everybody out! Out, right now! - When he says to go, - you go. - That means you, lady, right now. - Wait a minute. You know this guy? - We're old friends. Old friends? You're the case that shut down Sector Seven, got the kibosh, disbanded. No more security clearance, no retirement, no nothing. All 'cause of you and your little criminal girlfriend. - Look at her now, so mature. - Moron! Where's the whitefish? Hey! Don't touch me with the pig. - Yakov! - What? You don't get Christmas bonuses standing around! You want those new teeth you saw on SkyMall? - It's my dream. - Help her out. You live with your mama? No, my mama lives with me. It's a big difference. They got your face all over the news, alien boy. - Yeah, I know. - And NBE One's still kicking, huh? How did that happen? Don't answer. I don't know what you're hiding, but I don't want anything to do with it. So, good-bye. You never saw me. I got bagels to schmear. Vanish. Can you give me five seconds? Look, hold on, I need your help. Really? You need my help? I need... Look, I am slowly losing my mind. Okay, I had a little crab-bot, plunged a device deep into the soft tissues of my brain and started projecting little alien symbols like a freaking home movie! And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive. So, you think you got it rough? You said it projected images off your brain? - Right. - Meat locker, now! Dead pigs. What you're about to see is top secret. Do not tell my mother. - Swine flu. Not good. - Now you know. Next time you eat a goat or a pig, there's a story behind it. Sad little story. An entire city flat. How do you explain that? Are you saying you believe in aliens now? Okay, files, files. We're talking about symbols. Hey, still radioactive. Hands off. Okay, Cube-brain. Any of these look like the symbols you saw? Where'd you get these? Before I got fired, I poached S-7's crown jewel, over 75 years of alien research, which points to one inescapable fact. The Transformers, they've been here a long, long time. How do I know? Archeologists found these unexplained markings in ancient ruins all over the world. China. Egypt. Greece. Shot in 1932. These the symbols you're seeing in your head? - Yeah. - Same ones over here, right? So, tell me, how did they end up all drawing the same things? Aliens. And I think some of them stayed. Check this out. Project Black Knife. Robots in disguise, hiding here all along. We detected radioactive signatures all across the country. I pleaded on my knees with S-7 to investigate it, but they said the readings were infinitesimal, that I was obsessed. Me. Can you imagine that? Yeah. Megatron said that there was another Energon source here. - On Earth. Another source? - On Earth. Okay? And that these symbols, maps in my head, would lead him there. You talk to your Autobot friends about this? No, no, no, the source is before them. Whatever the Energon source is, it predates them. It's before them. - So, it comes before them. - Correct. Well, then we're porked, unless we can talk to a Decepticon. I mean, I'm not on speaking terms with them. Actually, I am. Let me out! - This is going to be a little bit sad. - Open it. I will have so many Decepticons on your butt! Hey, behave! - What is it, a Decepticon? - Yeah. - And you're training him? - I'm trying to. I spent my whole adult life combing the planet for aliens, and you're carrying around one in your purse like a little Chihuahua. Do you want a throwdown, you pubic 'fro-head? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry about your eye, you know, but, if you're a good boy, then I'm not gonna torch your other eye. Okay? I'm not gonna torch it. Just tell me what these symbols are, please. All right. I know that. That's the language of the Primes. I don't read it, but these guys... Where the frick did you find photos of these guys? - Is this they? - Yeah. Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old. They've been here thousands of years, looking for something. I don't know what. Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll translate those symbols for you. - And I know where to find them. - Show us. Yeah. The closest one's in Washington. Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. Land of dreams in there. All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut. - Hold those. - What is that? What? I wear them when I'm in a funk. So does Giambi, Jeter. It's a baseball thing. Okay. Watches synchronized, sharp mind and empty bladder. You get caught, demand an attorney and don't ever say my name. Okay, take one of these pills. Slip it under your tongue. It's the high-concentrate polymer they put in Oreo cookies. Tricks the polygraph every time. Okay. Now, let's get this show on the road. No, listen, I can't do this. I'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys. I'm not gonna do this. - Guards have guns. I don't want to die. - Kid, kid, kid. You compromise this mission, you are dead to me. Now look into my eyes and tighten up that sphincter. The museum is now closing. Yo, baba! Bad news, bro! Ran out of toilet paper! You got any out here? Please tell me you do. Sir! I suggest you get in there. The museum is closed! Listen, man, I understand that, but as you can see, this is important. All right? Thumper dumper. I got to go. All right. Sir, you are a grown, naked man around children. - Pull your pants up and exit the building. - I'm not going anywhere. - You got that paper, right, sir? - You should be embarrassed. This is a family museum, sir. What is going on here? How many times can you get tased in the nuts before you can't have kids? You are an amateur, man, a rank amateur. We just downed five guards. Five guards. - Get your stuff and get out of here. - Give me a second here. I got to get the tracker, all right. - Be good. - I'm claustrophobic. Look, look. Follow him. Follow him. He knows where he's going. - He knows something. - What? He knows something. You got what I got? - Yeah. - Blackbird. There he is. This guy's a legend, like the Chairman of the Board! Yo, freshman, point the shard and watch the magic happen. Shit. It's a Decepticon! - Decepticon? - Decepticon? Behind the MiG now! What sort of hideous mausoleum is this? Answer me, pawns and knaves! Show yourselves or suffer my infinite wrath! You little spinal-cord-based organisms! Bugger it! Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire! Prepare for remote systems override! - I tell you, this guy did not age well. - I don't think he's gonna hurt us. I command these doors to open. Fire! I said, fire! Bollocks! - Damn these worthless parts. - Wait a second! Itchy, wretched rust in my arse! The museum is going to be very angry. Very angry. We gotta catch that plane. - Right. I'm on a mission. - Wait, wait, wait, wait! - What do you want? - Look, we just want to talk! I have no time to talk. I'm on a mission. I'm a mercenary doom-bringer. What planet am I on? - Earth. - Earth? Terrible name for a planet. Might as well call it ""Dirt."" Planet ""Dirt."" Tell me, is that robot civil war still going on? - Who's winning? - The Decepticons. - Well, I changed sides to the Autobots. - What do you mean, ""changed sides""? It's a choice. It's an intensely personal decision. So much negativity. Who wants to live a life filled with hate? You mean you don't have to work for those miserable, freaking Decepticons? If Decepticons had their way, they'd destroy the whole universe. I'm changing sides. I'm changing sides, too, warrior goddess. - Who's your little Autobot? - You're cute. Name's Wheelie. Yeah. Say my name, say my name. What are you allowing to happen to your foot just now? At least he's faithful, Sam. Yeah, well, he's faithful and he's nude and he's perverted. Can you just... Can you stop? - Hey, what are you doing? - It's just something to think about. I won't argue with... What were you saying? I told you my name was Jetfire, so stop judging me. Somebody shit the bed this morning. - Look at this guy. - I have issues of my own. And it started with my mother! My ancestors have been here for centuries. My father, he was a wheel, the first wheel. - Do you know what he transformed into? - No. Nothing! But he did so with honor, dignity, damn it! Bollocks. My boosters are fried. I think we can help each other. You know things I don't know. I know things you don't know, I do. I don't think he knows anything. Honestly, I don't. I could do this all day. It comes in waves, these vivid symbols. They're symbols, but they're in my mind. You see, all this is in my mind and Megatron wants what's in my mind. - Him and someone called The Fallen. - The Fallen? I know him. He left me here to rust. The original Decepticon. He's terrible to work for. It's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis. These transcriptions, they were part of my mission, The Fallen's search. I remember now, for the Dagger's Tip, and the key. Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key? What are you talking about? No time to explain. Hold on, everybody! Stay still or you'll die! Well, that wasn't so bad. I just hope we're still on the right planet. Hey, that freaking hurt! Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, my God, what a beautiful face. This would be a perfect moment, except you landed on my testicles. Please, get off. God, my balls. Sam! - Where are we? Simmons! - Hey! Yeah! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What is this? It's Vegas. - You guys okay? - Yeah. Hey, I think we're in Vegas! That really, really hurt. You're just lucky that I didn't get hurt! People could have gotten killed, okay? And if I would have gotten hurt, - you would have heard... - Shut up. I told you I was opening a space bridge. It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt. When did you... When did you tell us? You didn't tell us anything. You didn't tell us anything. Why are we in Egypt? Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling! You were duly informed! Can you just stop for a second? Can you focus? Can you tell us why we're in Egypt so we can all have a little bit of semblance of peace of mind? This planet was visited by our race once before, by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago. They were on an exploratory mission to harvest Energon, the lifeblood of our race. Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize and rust, like my wretched self! Do you have any idea what it's like to slowly fall apart and die? Let's not get episodic, okay, old-timer? Beginning, middle, end. Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it. Somewhere buried in this desert, our ancestors built a great machine. It harvests Energon by destroying suns. - Destroy suns? - You mean blow them up? Yes. You see, in the beginning, there were seven Primes, our original leaders. And they set out into the universe, seeking distant suns to harvest. The Primes set out with one rule, never destroy a planet with life, until one of them tried to defy this rule. And his name forevermore was The Fallen. He despised the human race and he wanted to kill you all by turning on that machine. The only way to activate it is with a legendary key called the Matrix of Leadership. A great battle took place over possession of the Matrix. The Fallen was stronger than his brothers, so they had no choice but to steal and hide it from him. In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave their lives to seal the Matrix away in a tomb made of their very own bodies, a tomb we cannot find. Somewhere, buried in this desert, that deadly machine remains. The Fallen knows where it is and if he finds the tomb of the Primes, your world will be no more. Okay, so how do we stop him? Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen. Optimus Prime? So, you've met a Prime? Why, you must have met a great descendant. Is he alive, here on this planet? He sacrificed himself to save me. So, he's dead. Without a Prime, it's impossible. No one else could stop The Fallen. So, the same energy that's gonna be used to reactivate the machine, could that energy somehow be used to reactivate Optimus and bring him back to life? It was never designed for that purpose, but it's an energy like no other. So, then how do you get us to the Matrix before the Decepticons get to me? Follow your mind, your map, your symbols. What you carved in the sand, it's your clue. When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip, Three Kings will reveal the doorway! Find the doorway! Go now! Go! That was my mission. It's your mission now. Go before the Decepticons find me and find you. Okay, here's what my CIA contact says. Ancient Sumerians used to call the Gulf of Aqaba the ""Dagger's Tip."" - That's the Dagger's Tip. - It's part of the Red Sea. It divides Egypt and Jordan like the tip of a blade. 29.5 degrees north, 35 east. Here it is. First thing we've got to do is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip. How are you gonna get him halfway around the world? I'm gonna make a call. We got cops! I can't go to prison, guys. Sam, we got to get off this road and lay low. Man, stupid cops! This is what's called blending in like a ninja. - Shut up or I'll blend my fist in your face. - They're gone. Okay, we're running out of time. I gotta make the call to Lennox... You're on the Worldwide Wanted List. Try calling one base, they'll track you here in seconds. - CIA is all over this place! - You're gonna call. - Okay. That's a good idea. - All right. I mean, I just had my mind on other things, like winding up in an Egyptian prison. NEST departure, 2100 hours. So, we're shipping him back to base. This is such a mistake. Major Lennox, phone call. Lennox, I'm with the kid. The kid. You know, the one with the attitude, right? We need the truck. The truck. We got a possible resurrection going on over here. You're not gonna believe where we are. Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen. Back of a $1 bill. Coordinates for airdrop, 29.5 north, 34.88 east. Write it down. Write it. Oh, my God. I got to go. Okay. Heat comes. Wait, who are you? Wait. It's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo. Cops are coming right now. We need to go! Move, move, move, move. Coordinates, 29.5 north, 34.88 east. Tip of the Red Sea. Gulf of Aqaba. Egypt? Are you serious? Sir. Even if we could figure out a way to get big man over there, how is this little kid supposed to bring him back to life? Look, I don't know, but we got to trust him. Okay, let's go over it again. When the dawn alights the Dagger's Tip, - the Three Kings... - Will reveal the doorway. That's what he said. You know what it means? - No, what does it mean? - I have no idea. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Checkpoint. Checkpoint. I don't have my passport. Passport! They got cameras at the top. All right, chill. This is espionage time. I can handle it. These are my people. I'm one-thirty-sixth Arab. Great, a fricking Munchkin. Little people are mean. Tell him he's tall. The Dagger's Tip? Right? Egypt, Jordan. We want to go there. Me and my family. This is my family. This is my son, my other son, my daughter. We're tourists, from New York. - New York? - Yes. Yes. Fifty kilometers. You look like the guy that runs my falafel stand. Thank you very much. - I know. I know you from somewhere. - Go, Yankees! Put it on the wire to the CIA. Decepticons, boy's location detected. Undercover, yo. You got to blend in with your surroundings. You know, you got to be part of the landscape. Awesome! I think aliens built that. Yeah, yeah. Come on. Move it! Move it! Guard us. Low profile. Don't make a scene, okay? Yeah, some of us got work to do! Dumb Autobots. Being my girlfriend is hazardous to your health. Yeah, well, girls like dangerous boys. - Do they? - Yeah. You might as well just say it. Ladies first. Okay, so tonight you're going to be a gentleman. - You're really chivalrous. - Why are you mad at me? You know what? Baby, I'm not... I'm not mad. Do you realize that I just flew 3,000 miles to keep you from getting killed? I know. Who else could be your girlfriend, Sam? Look at the things I go through with you. And now we're underneath the moon and the stars and the three most beautiful pyramids on the planet and you still can't even tell me that you love me. Pyramids. What? Why do boys always - change the subject? - Pyramids and stars. - Sam? - Come with me really quick. Simmons! Leo! Wake up! Listen, astronomy class, page 47. Remember the class? No. I was only in college for two days. Remember that? - Here. Get up. Up, up. - What is he talking about? Okay, you see those three stars? You see how the last one touches the horizon? That's Orion's belt, but it's also called the Three Kings. And the reason for that is the three Egyptian kings who built the pyramids of Giza built them to mirror those stars, so it's like an arrow staring us straight in the face. They all point due east, towards Jordan. The mountains of Petra. We've had an engine malfunction. We're gonna have to divert to SOCCENT. Flight master, let's lighten the load and prepare for bailout. Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? - All right, team, grab your chutes! - Bailout like bailout? - You familiar with the standard MC-4? - Of course not! I've never jumped out of a perfectly good airplane before! Wait a minute, is this really happening? - Yeah. - All right, here we go. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're behind this, aren't you? What are you talking about? You heard the pilot. These guys don't mess around. This is just standard procedure. I'm just following orders to the letter. Isn't that what you said? You just signed a death warrant on your career, Major. What was that? What was that? That's not good. Come on. - Right this way! - I can't jump out of an airplane! - I have an ulcer! No, no. - Come on. It's okay. I really can't do this. What are you doing... Come here! Come here. - Why aren't you wearing your chute? - Because I have to secure the VIPs first. Okay, I want you to listen very carefully and memorize everything that I say. Each chute has a GPS tracker so you can be found by Search and Rescue. Right next to that's a fabric webbing called a bridle, which holds the pin that keeps the main container closed. - Okay, are you listening? - I can't hear what... - Stop that! - All right. All right. All right, when the pilot chute inflates into the air, it pulls the pin and opens the main. Red's your backup, blue's your primary. I want you to pull the blue. I need you to pull it really hard! Not now, we're on the plane, you dumb-ass! - He say good-bye? - No, he didn't even say good-bye. General, we're loaded and ready. You give us the go, and we'll be ready to press in five minutes. - Excellent. - Sir, you need to see this now. - Have we checked these coordinates? - Egypt, sir. - They're airdropping in. - You've got to be kidding me. He knows something. We need to be ready to back him up if this thing goes hot. Copy that. CIA just got a hit on the boy, 100 miles from the location on that little note there. It's getting hotter. It's gotta be around here somewhere. You see the size of this? - You see this? - Spectacular. Amazing. Look at that. - It's here somewhere, guys. - Yeah, why? 'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird who doesn't even know what planet he's on? In his defense, this is the biggest doorway I've ever seen in my entire life. Okay. Well, that's great. Let me do a quick search, all right? Nope. Ever cross your mind, guys, that archeologists have been here before? There's nothing here. Real life is heartbreak, despair, kid. Sometimes you get to the end of the rainbow and the leprechauns went and booby-trapped it! I'm listening to you? You live with your mother! - It's not over. - It is over. It's done. Why are we still listening to you, little punk-ass? I mean, what you ever done for us except ding my rim? Killed Megatron. How about that? Well, he didn't get the job done, you know what I mean, 'cause he's back now... - Are you scared? - Scared? Scared of your ugly face! I'm ugly? Well, we're twins, you stupid genius! Bring it, then! Get off me! - I'll change your face around! - I'll get all up in that ass! Bring it! Guys! - You like the way that feels? - That didn't hurt. You like that, don't you? - Come on, Bumblebee! - Bumblebee, listen. Now, that's rude. Oh, my God. The symbols. Bee! Shoot it. - Check this out. - Look at it. Wow! These are the bodies Jetfire was talking about. The tomb of the Primes. Yo! Yo! The Matrix. No. No. Thousands of years, turned to dust. This isn't how it's supposed to end. Hear that? US Air Force! C-17s! - What's a C-17? - You can't bring him back, Sam. - There's nothing left. - Look! Look around you. We didn't just go through everything we went through for no reason at all, to just have it end like this. There is a reason that we are here. The voices and the symbols in my head led us here for a purpose. Everyone's after me because of what I know, and what I know is that this is going to work. - How do you know it's gonna work? - Because I believe it. You best let me out of this plane. Dropping the big boy. Sam! You think you can bring him back to life with that pixie dust? Absolutely. Let's go. Go! Let's move it. Remember, they're friendlies. Cover Optimus! Secure the village. Get those cases down here. I need snipers and Stingers up high. So, we just dropped off 10 tons of dead robot in the middle of nowhere. I hope this little kid know what he's doing. Yeah, me too. Got a visual! Yellow team! Four clicks! Pop flare! - That's them, right there. See the flare? - Right over there! See it? Sam! Oh, God. Please, God! Please. Leo, stop freaking out. Stop freaking out. Shut this guy up, huh? - Please, just let me live, just let me live! - Shut up and let him drive! - Just stop screaming... - All right, that's it! I can't take that guy anymore. Hide in the dust! Use the dust! We've got to split up. Bumblebee, you're the decoy. You lead the Decepticons away, all right? I'm gonna get Optimus. I'll help draw their fire with Huey and Dewey there. You get to those soldiers. - I hope that dust works, kid. - Thank you. He's turning around. He's coming back. He's coming back. It's up to me. One man, alone, betrayed by the country he loves, now its last hope in their final hour of need. Prepare to be driven like never before, by the maestro. - Hey, hey! Don't go nowhere! Drive. - You'll never make it, kid. - I'm coming with you. - Bravery will only get you so far. You tased me, okay? You owe me! I'm going. Okay, okay. That was a test. You passed. All right? That thing's got alien tattoos all over it. That ain't Air Force. - What the hell was that? - Anyone copy? - Anyone there? Who's up? - Copy? - Radio's down. - It's dead. Comms are down. EMP burst. I see how this day is going in this godforsaken desert. Yes, sir? - Major Lennox told me to pull the cord. - I know, sir. Well, what country am I in right now? United States. No, not the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm in the middle of nowhere surrounded by donkeys. Well, that was our good friend, Galloway. He's less than pleased. How is it that we can't reach our men, but he can reach me from some random Egyptian desert? Nothing. Right, go burn an SOS. Let the eye in the sky know we need some help. - Yes, sir. - Okay, boys, old school time! Pop some more flares so the kid can find us. Look. There it is. We got a couple of miles. Lennox's team has the latest in quantum crypto gear. Can somebody tell me why we can't establish simple radio contact? We're hailing them on every frequency and mode in the book, sir. Our satellites in the area have gone blind. We're working it, sir. Damn it. Something's not right. It doesn't add up. Contact the Jordanians, see what air assets they've got in the area, and get Egypt's General Salam. Ask him to clear some USV overflights in Egyptian airspace. We need an assist in confirming visuals now. Scramble Predators now. V-1, rotate. We still have a mile that way. Come on. This way. This way. - One man, alone... - Stop saying that! ...betrayed by the country he loves! Oh, my goodness. I'm in the car, okay? You're not alone. Just relax. You're with the maestro. I don't think he's still following us. That's what you think. Master, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the soldiers brought the body of Prime. The boy must have the Matrix. We cannot let him reach Optimus. Decepticons, begin our assault! We've got incoming! We got a whole lot of fight coming our way. - How many? - About 13 of them. This ain't good. This ain't good. We're about to get our asses whupped. Bravo-Charlie, kneel! All right, those Decepticons are searching for Sam. Whatever he has, he thinks it'll bring Optimus back to life, so our mission is to find him and get him to Optimus. All right, we're gonna draw fire from the left flank. I need a scout team. I'm leading. Go up through the middle with Arcee and Ironhide! All right, when you see the precious cargo, I want you to pop green smoke and come back through those pillars. We'll have the ambush set. All right. Let's go. Move out! You ever see that film Gunfight at the O.K. Corral? - With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas? - No, why? - Looks like we're right in the middle of it. - Is that good? A lot of people died. Hide! - Vmonos, amigos! - Oh, my God! - Hit the deck! - Oh, my God! Sam, Sam. I don't think they saw us. Get down. Get down. Get down. Okay. Listen. Once it's clear, we run for Optimus as fast as we can, okay? What if it doesn't work? It's gonna work. - What if it doesn't? - It's gonna work. It'll work. Up, up, up! Get ready to jump! We got a half-mile. I don't think the soldiers know we're here. Fall back! - Ironhide, up the middle! - Ironhide, move it! Let's go! Go, go! Devastator! We're trapped! There's nowhere to go. We're gonna die. If we're going out, we're going out like men, understand? Look at this mother... Mean robots suck! Hang on! Hang on, okay? - Simmons! - Don't let go! Hang in there, I got you! Just hang in. I don't want to die! Kung fu grip, boy. Kung fu grip! You ain't getting me! He dead. He got so ate. - Who's your daddy now, huh? - He got all ate up. The only safe place is right under it. - Run at it. Run for its feet! Move it! - Yeah. You should've never eaten me! I'm gonna bust your face up! Oh, my God! Nobody mess with me! In your face! Keep fighting, Mudflap! Oh, my God! Nobody messes with the twins. I got you... My bad! Man! You shot me in the face! - Stay under it! - Yeah, stay under it! Come on. Judy! - Sam! Sam! - What? Sam! Sam! Sam! - Sam! - Dad! Wait, wait! Please listen to me! I want you to run! Run! Dad, just stop! They don't want you, they want me! - Oh, God! - Wait! Sam Witwicky. Don't hurt them. This is what you want. You don't want them. - Go! Go! - Please, stop! - Stop! - Listen to your father! Just get out of here! Just don't hurt them. I know what you want. Just go! Just go! And I know that you need me because I know about the Matrix. - Don't do it, Sam... - Please, Dad. - They're going to kill us all anyway! - Here's what you want, right here. Bumblebee! Kill him, Bee. Kill him. - Stay tight, Ma. - Come on. Get in here. - Bee? - Yeah. - Hey! - I don't know what's going on, but we've got to move! There's got to be a way out of here! Judy, get back, get back, get back. Against the wall! Against the wall! Against the wall. Against the wall. Bee! Bumblebee! You get them somewhere safe, all right? You've got to get in the car and get to safety. No, this isn't up for discussion! - You're my son! You're my son! - I know. - Dad... - We all go together! - Listen... - We're all going together! Dad, stop, okay? Get in the car. He's gonna get you to safety. You know, you run. You don't stop, you don't hide, you run. You hear what I'm saying, okay? I'll find you when you're safe. - No. - You've got to let me go, Dad. - You have to let me go. You have to. - Ron. Ron. Ron, let him go. You come back! Come on. Ron! Mikaela! Mikaela! - Go with my parents. - I'm not gonna go without you. Move to cover! We got Jordanians! We got help! Down! You okay, soldier? We're gonna help you, soldier. Let's get these wounded clear of the bird. Stay still. Stay still. Don't move. You all right, young man? You have a radio? Hey, kid, it's been nice knowing you. Remember what I did for my country. This is my moment. You're crazy! ETA to station, two minutes. - Put it on the main screen. - Sir. Yes, sir. Predator 01. Shit, it's a trick. Commence Operation Firestorm. Send everyone. - Get those Marines on the ground. - Roll in strike packages... Task Force Ripper, execute Lightning. - Spotted Sam! - Sam! Ironhide! Follow us to the pillars. We'll take you to Optimus. Get out, Sam! Get to the pillars! Let's go. Oh, God. This is it. The pyramid's built right over the machine. If they turn that machine on, no more sun. Not on my watch. Not on my watch. USS Stennis. Identify. Where the hell are you? Watching the Weather Channel? SportsCenter? I Dream of Jeannie or something? We got 300 satellites up there. Where the hell are all our men? Identify yourself. What is your name, sailor? Wilder, Captain of the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier. Okay, Captain Wilder. This is Agent Seymour Simmons of Sector Seven. There is the mother of all non-biologicals getting ready to blow up our sun. Do you want to have a throwdown about my lack of clearance or do you want to help save a gazillion lives? All right, Agent Simmons. I'm listening. Five clicks west of the Gulf, we got ourselves an alien remodeling a pyramid. Our one hope is a prototype weapon called a rail gun, - shoots a steel projectile at Mach 7. - That's classified. Don't talk to me about classified, all right? Now, if you've got a battleship in the Gulf, which I know you do, you tell them to ready that weapon! Contact destroyer USS KIDD. Alpha Team, flank left! This way! Move it! - Where do you need us, sir? - Protect those in the line of fire. Let's go! Go! Give me your Comms. Come on. Epps! Right now, we need air support, ASAP! Have troops in contact 20 miles northwest. Radar contact. Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra... B-1, snap 090. You are approved to drop your 2,000-pound JDAMs. - What you got? - I couldn't get to them, sir. They're 600 meters away and they're heading right for the pillars. All right. Precious cargo's coming! Move! Curse you! Sam! Spotted Sam! - Come on! - 2-2 covering fire. Two civilians, 12 o'clock! Cover for us! Hold the air strike! We're rescuing civilians! Keep firing! Come on! Mikaela! Come on! Get in here! Look who showed up. You better have a good reason for us to be here. - Where's Optimus? - He's right over there, across the courtyard. - I got to get to him right now. - Not with an air strike coming. I have to get to him right now. Go. Back, back, back, back. - Go. - Listen up... Okay. Incoming! Stick the landing. Behold the glory of Jetfire! Now let me show you how we brought the pain in my day! I'm too old for this crap. Keep going, man, 15 rounds of fighting. I am directly below the enemy's scrotum. 25.7 meters above sea level, 29.32 north. - Kill track, 5205... - Target acquired. - Killing track. - Two, one... Fire! Yeah! Yeah! B-1's time on target, 30 seconds. 2,000-pound JDAMs inbound. We're gonna make a break through the B's on my command, okay? You guys stick with me, you understand? You stay on my ass. - 1-1 tally orange smoke. - I hope these F-16s got good aim. - Yeah? Why is that? - I told them to hit the orange smoke. You mean that orange smoke? It wasn't my best toss, okay? - Viper, thunder. - Run! Incoming! Come on! Sam! Run! Die! Sam! Hold your fire! Sam! Stay back! Mikaela, stay back! Fucking do something! - Sam! Sam! - Sam! Sam! Sam! Sammy! Sam! - Let me go! - Come on, you got to move. - You got to move, come on. - We got no pulse. Starting CPR. - I have to see my kid! I got a son... - Sammy! Sam! - Clear. - Ready to shock. - Clear! - Ready to shock. One, two, three. Do it again! No! Okay, listen to my voice. I love you and I need you. Please. Please, come back to me. Sam, please! I love you. Where am I? Where am I? Am I dead? Am I dead? We have been watching you a long, long time. You have fought for Optimus, our last descendant, with courage and with sacrifice, the virtues of a leader, a leader worthy of our secret. The Matrix of Leadership is not found, it is earned. Return now to Optimus. Merge the Matrix with his spark. It is, and always has been, your destiny. Sam! I love you. I love you. Boy, you returned for me. A living Prime. I don't believe it! My Matrix! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up, Prime! Oh, no. He's turning on the machine! You got to stop him! Get up! Optimus! Fallen, my master. My brothers could not stop me from this. Yes, now I claim your sun. - Move! - Enemy target, top of pyramid. Engage! Engage! Engage! In moments, we'll be at firing strength. All my Decepticon life, I never did a thing worth doing until now. Optimus, take my parts and you will have a power you've never known. Fulfill your destiny. Jolt! Electrify! Transplant those afterburners. Let's roll. Fire mission on the pyramids. This planet will be dark forever. Die, like your brothers! They were your brothers, too. Starscream! You picked the wrong planet. Give me your face. I rise. You fall. No, no. Not to call you a coward, Master, but sometimes cowards do survive. This isn't over. It took all this for you to tell me that you love me. You said it first. Thank you, Sam, for saving my life. Welcome. Thank you for believing in me. Our races united by a history long forgotten and a future we shall face together. I am Optimus Prime, and I send this message so that our pasts will always be remembered, for in those memories, we live on. So glad you could join us, Professor Einstein. Yeah, I was kind of busy. Okay.,  When I was lying there in the VA hospital ...  ... with a big hole blown through the middle of my life, ...  ... I started having these dreams of flying.  I was free. Sooner or later though, ...  ... you always have to wake up. In Cryo you don't dream at all. It doesn't feel like 6 years. More like a fifth of tequila and ass-kicking. Tommy was the scientist, not me. He was the one who wanted to get shot light-years out in space to find the answers. Are we there yet? Yeah, we're there sunshine. We're there. It's about your brother. So, a week before Tommy was gonna ship out... A guy with a gun ends his journey ... ... for the paper in his wallet. Being in Cryo for 5 years, 9 months and 22 days. You will be hungry, you will be weak. If you feel nauseous please use the ... Yeah, Tommy was the scientist. Me, I'm just another dumb grunt going some place he's gonna regret. Up ahead was Pandora. You grew up hearing about it, but I never figured I'd be going there. Your brother represented a significant investment. We'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract. And since your genome is identical to his, you could step into his shoes. So to speak. It'd be a fresh start, on a new world. And the pay is good. Very good. Exo-Packs on! Let's go, Exo-Packs on! Remember people, you lose that mask you're unconscious in 20 seconds. You're dead in 4 minutes. Let nobody be dead today. It looks very bad on my report. This is TAD-1-6 on approach. Crossing outer marker. Monument in sight One life ends... Another begins. Harnesses off. Get your packs ... -- Put it together. Let's go. One minute, let's go. When the ramp comes down, go directly into the base. Do not stop. Go straight inside. Wait for my mark! Go! Go! Go! Go! .. Get out of there! Keep moving. Let's go! There's no such thing as an ex-Marine. You may be out...  ... but you never lose the attitude. I told myself I could pass any test a man can pass. They can fix the spine, if you got the money. But not on Vet benefits, not in this economy. Let's go Special K. Do not make me wait for you! Well, well, ladies. Look at all this fresh meat!  Back on Earth, these guys were Army dogs. Marines. Fighting for freedom. Look out hot rod. But out here they're just hired guns, taking the money, working for the company. Check this out man. Meals on wheels. Aww, man , that is just wrong. You are not in Kansas any more. You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen. Respect that fact, every second of every day. If there is a hell, you might wanna go there for some R and R after a tour on Pandora. Out there beyond that fence, every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for Ju-Ju Beads We have an indigenous population of humanoids called the Na'vi. They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin that will stop your heart in one minute. And they have bones reinforced with naturally occuring carbon fiber. They are very hard to kill. As head of security, it is my job to keep you alive. I will not succeed. Not with all of you. If you wish to survive you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude. You've got to obey the rules. Pandora rules. Rule number one... It's nothing like an old school safety brief to put your mind at ease. Jake, you're Jake right? Tom's brother. You look just like him. Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman. I went through Avatar training with him. The Bio-Lab. We're gonna spend a lot of time here. How you doing, Norm, Avatar driver. Here's the link room right here. This is where we're connecting to the Avatar. Me and Norm are here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called Avatars. And they're grown from human DNA mixed with the DNA of the natives. Hey, welcome. Welcome to Pandora, good to have you. Damn, they got big. - They fully mature on the flight out. So the progress up the stim seem to work really well. Yeah, they got great muscle tone. It'll take us a few hours to get them prepared, but you can take them out tomorrow. There's yours. Doctor, Norm Spellman. - Pleasure to meet you. Looks like him. Looks like you. This is your Avatar now, Jake. The concept is that every driver is matched to his own Avatar. So that their nervous system are in tune. Or something... Which is why they offered me the gig, because I can link with Tommy's Avatar. Which is insanely expensive. Is this right? I just say whatever to the video log? Yeah, we gotta get the habit of documenting everything. What we see, what we feel, it's all part of the science. And good science is good observation. - Plus it'll help keep you sane for the next 6 years. Whatever. So uh, ... Here I am. Doing science. They're coming out. Attention, drivers coming out of the lane. Oh God ... - Where's the lab coat? - Where's her lab coat? Who's got my goddamn cigarette!? Guys, what's wrong with this picture? Thank you! Grace Augustine is a legend. She's the head of the Avatar program. She wrote the book. I mean literally wrote the book on Pandoran botany. That's because she likes plants better than people. Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball. Grace I'd like you to meet Norm Spellman and Jake Sully. Norm, I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi? Grace, this is Jake Sully. Yeah yeah, I know who you are and I don't need you. I need your brother. You know, the PHD who trained for three years for this mission... He's dead. I know it's a big inconvenience for everyone. How much lab training have you had? I dissected a frog once. You see? They're just pissing on us with out even a courtesy of calling it rain. I'm going to Selfridge. - No Grace! No man, this is such bullshit! I'm gonna kick his corporate butt. He has no business sticking his nose in my department. Here tomorrow, 08:00. Try and use big words. Scorpion 2 Hotel, Hell's Gate Tower. You are cleared for South departure. ... Did you see that? - Yes sir. No you didn't, you were looking at the monitor. I love this putter Ronnie. Parker... I used to think it was benign neglect, but now I see that you're intentionally screwing me. Grace, I enjoy our little talks... I need a researcher, not some jar-head drop out. Well, actually, I thought we got lucky with him. Lucky? - Yeah. How is this in any way 'lucky'? Lucky your guy had a twin brother. And lucky that brother wasn't some oral hygenist or something. A Marine we could use. I'm assigning him to your team as security escort. The last thing I need is another trigger-happy moron out there. Look, you're supposed to be winning the hearts and the minds of the natives, isn't that the whole point of your little puppet show? You look like them, you talk like them and they'll start trusting us. We build them a school, we teach them English... But after how many years relations with the indigenous are only getting worse. That tends to happen when you use machine guns on them. Right, come here. This is why we're here, Unobtanium. Because this little gray rock sells for 20 million a kilo. That's the only reason. It's what pays for the whole party. It's what pays for your science. Comprendo? Now, those savages are threatening our whole operation. We're on the brink of war and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution. So use what you've got and get me some results. How much link-time have you logged? About 520 hours. - That's good. You're in there. You're here. How much have you logged? - Zip. But I read a manual. Tell me you're joking. This is cool. Let's go. Don't. I got this. So you just figured you'd come out here to the most hostile environment known to man... with no training of any kind and see how it went? What was going through your head? Maybe I was sick of doctors telling me what I couldn't do. Biometrics are good. - 1-3 is ready. Keep your arms in, hands in. Head down. Down. Just relax and let your mind go blank. That shouldn't be hard for you. Kiss the darkest part of my... - Initiate link. Run sequence, Unit 3. - Launching. I have the first congruency. That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity. Go figure. - Phase lock 40%. I'm going in. I'm going in in 4. Phase lock 99%. Link is stable. Jake, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Jake? Pupillary reflex is good. Hearing response normal. How are you feeling Jake? Hey guys. Welcome to your new body Jake.  Good. We're gonna take this nice and easy Jake. And touch your thumb to your fingers. Thumb to your fingers. No problem. - Good. I can see you remember that one. Got it. Well, if you want to sit up, that's fine. Let's take it nice and slow Jake. No tranquil attacks here, that's good. Do you feel lightheaded or dizzy? Wiggling your toes. - Good Jake. System motor control is good. Are you feeling any numbness or pain? Take it easy, don't get ahead of yourself, okay? There are few more sensory and motor reflex tests we need to run, so take it easy. Sit down. - Jake listen to me. Jake I need you to sit down. - It's OK, I got this. Jake you need to sit down. - Guys get him back on the gurney now. You need to sit down. you need time to adjust to atm.. Yeah! Sedate him! 1,000 mg of Seconal. Stop! ... -- Stop! Woah ... Woah. - Jake! - Jake, listen to me. You're not used to your Avatar body, this is dangerous. This is great. - Come on, they're gonna put you out. Sit down! No no, ... I got to get out of these leads. Goddammit! Bring them! Come on, you ain't got no skills. I don't even have to play defense. - Hey guys. It's OK, I'll get him. - Jake you have to come inside. Sorry. You're not supposed to be running! Sorry. - Watch it. Hey Marine! Damn... Grace? Who did you expect numb nuts? Think fast! Motor control is looking good. C'mon everybody quiet down. Lights out. C'mon Louise, chop chop. Don't play with that, you'll go blind. That's kinda freaky. - C'mon. Scat. Lights out, see you at dinner kitties. Welcome back. You all right? - Yeah, I'm OK. I'm Trudy, I fly all the Scientzoids. And this here is my baby. Hold on a second. Hey Wainfleet, get it done. We bounce at 09:00. - I'm on it captain. Mine-Strike's still loose. - You guys are packing some heavy gear. Watch it! That's cause we're not the only thing flying around out there. Or the biggest. But I need you on a Door-Gun. I'm a man short. Thought you'd never ask. There's your man. See you on the flight lane. You wanted to see me Colonel? This low gravity will make you soft. You get soft... Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning. I pulled your record Corporal. Venezuela, that was some mean bush. Nothing like this here though. You got some heart, kid, showing up in this neighborhood. Figured it's just another hell hole. - I was the first Recon myself. Few years ahead of you, well maybe more than a few. Three tours in Nigeria, not a scratch. I come out here... Day one. Think I felt like a shavetail Louie? They could fix me up, if I rotated back. Make me pretty again. But you know what, I kinda like it. It reminds me every day what's waiting out there. The Avatar program is a bad joke. Bunch a limp dick science majors. However, it does present an opportunity most timely and unique. Clear! A Recon GI-re in an Avatar body. That's a potent mix, Gives me the goosebumps. Such a Marine could provide the intel I need, right on the ground. Right in the hostile's camp. Look Sully, I want you to learn these savages from the inside. I want you to gain their trust. I need to know how to force their cooperation or hammer them hard if they won't. Am I still with Augustine? - On paper. You walk like on of her science pukes. ... You quack like one... But you report to me. Can you do that for me son? Hell yeah sir. Well all right then. Son, I take care of my own. You get me what I need, I'll see to it you get your legs back when you rotate home. Your real legs. That sounds real good sir. Link's ready. Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.  Link 3 ready. All right, I'm going in. Shut it down, we're gonna stay a while. Norm, your pack. Stay with the ship. One idiot with a gun is enough. You the man, Doc. Prolemurs, they're not aggressive. Relax Marine, you're making me nervous. So, how will they know we're here? - I'm sure they're watching us right now. Keep moving Norm. - Keep up guys. And here I go. - Scanning. It's that fast? Amazing isn't it? - Yeah That is signal transduction from this root to the root of the tree next to it. So, we should take a sample. Okay, ... Sample. You know, it's probably electrical, based on the speed of the reaction. Norm, you've contaminated the sample with your saliva. Oh, right. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. You'll piss him off. It's already pissed off. Jake, that armor is too thick, trust me. It's a territorial threat display, do not run or he'll charge. So what do I do? Dance with it? Just, hold your ground. C'mon, what you got?! Oh yeah. Who's bad? That's right. That's what I'm talking about bitch. That's right, get your punk ass back to mommy. You got nothing, keep running. Why don't you bring back some friends. What about this one? Run, don't run, what?! Run, definitely run! We're gonna have to call it guys, we're not allowed to run Night Ops. Col's orders. Sorry doc, he's just gonna have to hang on till morning. He won't make it till morning. I don't have all goddamn night. Come on! Wait, don't! Great. I know you probably don't understand this. But... Thank you. Thank you. That was pretty impressive. I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along. Wait a second, where are you going? Wait up. Slow down. I just wanted to say thanks for killing those things... Don't thank. You don't thank for this. This is sad. Very sad, only. OK, I'm sorry. Whatever I did, I'm sorry. All this is your fault. They did not need to die. My fault? They attacked me. How am I the bad guy? Your fault! - Aye, wooo. Your fault. -- Easy. You're like a baby, making noise, don't know what to do. Fine If you love your little forest friends... Why not let them just kill my ass? What's the thinking? Why save you? - Why save me? You have a strong heart. No fear. But stupid, ignorant like a child. Well if I'm like a child, then .. ... maybe you should teach me. Sky people can not learn. You do not see. - Teach me how to see. No one can teach you to see. Come on, can't we talk? Where did you learn to speak english? Dr. Augustine's school? You're like a baby. I need your help. You should not be here. OK, take me with you. - No, go back. No. Go back. What are they? Seeds of the sacred tree. Very pure spirits. What was that all about? Come. Where are we going? Come. What's your name? What's going on? What's happening? What's he saying? What's he saying? My father is deciding whether to kill you. Your father? It's nice to meet you sir. That is mother, she is Tsahik, the one who interprets the will of Eywa. Who's Eywa? What are you called? Jake Sully. Why did you come to us? I came to learn. We have tried to teach other sky people. It is hard to fill a cup which is already full. My cup is empty, trust me. Ask Dr. Augustine, I'm no scientist. What are you? I was a Marine. A warrior, of the jarhead clan. It is decided. My daughter will teach you our ways, Learn well Jake Sully. And we will see if your insanity can be cured. Good evening. Please don't get up. Sorry. Hey, how you doing? Jake. ... Jake. - He's coming out. Jake! Come on back kid. Come on. That's it. There you go. You were talking like a tick. Is the Avatar safe? - Yeah Doc. You are not gonna believe where I am. The last thing we see is this Marine's ass disappearing in the bush with this angry Thanator coming after him. It's not something you can teach. For reasons I cannot fathom the Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us all. Jarhead clan? And it worked? I'm practically family. They're gonna study me, I have to learn to be one of them. That's called taking initiative son. I wish I had ten more like you, Sully, just find out what the blue monkeys want. You know, we tried to give them medicine, education... ... roads, but no, they like mud. And that wouldn't bother me, it's just that their uh ... Can somebody just... Sector 12. Stop. Where .. Stop. Jesus. Their damn village happens to be resting on the richest Unobtanium deposit within 200 clicks in any direction. I mean, look at all that cheddar. Who gets them to move? - Guess? What if they won't go? I'm betting that they will. Killing the indigenous looks bad. But there's one thing that shareholders hate more than bad press. And that's a bad quarterly statement. I didn't make up the rules. So just find me a carrot that will get them to move, otherwise it's going to have to be all stick. Okay? You got three months. That's when the dozers get there. Well we're wasting time. I like this guy. OK, let's run through them again. Moat: Dragon lady. Eytuken. - Eytukan He's the clan leader. She's their spiritual leader. Like a Shaman. - Got it. Tsutey. - Tsu'tey He'll be the next clan leader. Neytiri. - She'll be the next Tsahik. They become a mated pair. So who's this Eywa? - Who's Eywa?! Only their Deity. Their Goddess made up of all living things. Everything they know. You'd know this if you had any training whatsoever. Who's got a date with the chief's daughter? Let's go. Village life starts early. Don't do anything unusually stupid. Easy boy. It's a female. Easy girl That is Sa'helu, the bond. Feel her. Feel her heart beat. Her breath. Feel her strong legs. You may tell her what to do, inside. For now, say where to go. Forward. You should go away. Nah, you'd miss me. I knew you could speak english. Again. If you want to hit this thing, it's going to be complicated. Your scan doesn't show the internal structure. There's an outer row of columns, real heavy duty. There's a secondary ring here, and an inner ring. There's a core structure like a spiral. That's how they move up and down. We're gonna need accurate scans of every column. Roger that. What else can you tell us about the structure? I'm guessing this secondary ring, that's also load bearing. Where are we going? Gettin out of Dodge. I'm not about to let Selfridge and Quaritch micro-manage this thing. There's a mobile link up as site 26, we can work out of, way up in the mountains. The Hallelujah mountains? That's right. - Are you serious? Yeah. Yes! The legendary floating mountains of Pandora, heard of them? We're getting close. Yeah, look at my instruments. We're in the flux vortex. VFR from here on. - What's VFR? Means you got to see where you're going. You can't see anything. - Exactly. Ain't that a bitch. Oh my God... You should see your faces. Thank you for flying Air Pandora. Welcome to Camp. So, this is my bunk. - This stuff is nasty. Norm, go under. Grace didn't miss a thing. She knew I was talking to the Colonel. But I had what she needed, a way back in with the clan. So she's playing nice. Jake, hang a left. You'll be in the link at the end. Unit 1, Beulah. She's the least glitchy. Holy shit. Do not look in her eye. Ikran is not horse. When Sa'helu is made... Ikran will fly well. Only one hunter in the whole life. To become Aron'yu, hunter... You must choose your own Ikran and he must choose you. When? - When you are ready. Okay, ... This is video log 12. Time is 21:32. Do I have to do this now? Like, I really need to get some rack. No, now, when it's fresh. Location, shack. The days are starting to blur together. The language is a pain, but... I figure it's like field stripping a weapon, repetition, repetition... If only you were stronger. Neytiri calls me Scoun. It means moron. Norm's attitude is improved lately. But it's not just I'm seeing you in front of me I see into you... It's good he's back on board, but he thinks I'm a Scoun too. You've got to run, OK? Let's go. I feel me getting tougher. I can run farther every day. I have to trust my body to know what to do. Yeah, check it out! Crap. Every day it's reading the trail, track's of the wora'hon, tiniest scents and sounds. She's always going on about the flow of energy the spirits of animals. I really hope this tree hugging crap isn't on the final. This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there you know. You need to listen to what she says. Try to see the forest through her eyes. Excuse me, this is my video log here. With Neytiri it's learn fast or die. You got to be kidding me. I talked Moat into letting Grace into the village. 1st time since her school was closed down. No you don't, come back here. Bon apetit. Come on, Marine. I'm trying to understand this deep connection the people have to the forest. She talks about a network of energy. That flows through all living things. She says, all energy is only borrowed. And one day you have to give it back. A clean kill. You are ready. Learning to ride an Ikran, we call them Banshees, is the test every young hunter has to pass. But to do that, you got to go where the banshees are. Ooh-rah Jake Sully will go first. Now you choose your Ikran. This you must feel inside. If he also chooses you move quick like I showed. You will have one chance Jake. How will I know if he chooses me? He will try to kill you. Outstanding. Let's dance. Make the bond! Jake! Sa'Helu Jake! Sa'Helu! Stop! That's right, you're mine. First flight seals the bond, you can not wait. Think fly. - Fly? God damn... Oh shit! Shut up and fly straight! That's it. Bank left. Level out! That's it. Go Jake Sully! Yeah baby I got this! Oh shit! I may not be much of a horse guy, but I was born to do this. I came like this, this you, I turn, I feel the wind, I turn very strong. I see, I bank so hard. The Tree of Souls. Aybetraya Ramunam It's their most sacred place. See the flux vortex and these full color images? That's what messes up my instruments. There is something really interesting going on in there biologically. I would die to get samples. Outsiders are strictly forbidden. You lucky swine. I was a stone cold aerial hunter. Death from above. Only problem is, you're not the only one. Dive! Follow me! Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx. It is Toruk, Last Shadow. Right, it's the last one you ever see. My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk Makto. Rider of last shadow. He rode this? Toruk chose him. It has only happen five times since the time from the first songs. That's a long time. - Yes. Toruk Makto was mighty. He brought the clans together in a time of Great Sorrow. All Na'vi people know the story. Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream. It's hard to believe it's only been three months. I barely remember my own life. I don't know who I am anymore. Haven't got lost in the woods, have you? Your last report was more than two weeks ago. I'm starting to doubt your resolve. Way I see it, it's time to terminate the mission. - I can do this. You already have. You've given me good usable intel. This Tree of Souls place... Yeah, I got them by the balls with that when this turns into a shit fight which it will. Now is time to come in. By the way, you're gonna get your legs back. Yeah, I got you Corporate approval. It's a done deal, gonna have you on a shuttle tonight. I'm a man of my word. I got to finish this. It's one more thing. Ceremony... It's the final stage of becoming a man. If I do it, I'm one of them. They'll trust me. And I can negotiate the terms of their relocation. Than you better get it done Corporal. The Na'vi say, every person is born twice. The second time is when you earn your place among the people, forever. Come. This is a place for prayers to be heard. And sometimes answered. We call this tree Utral Aymokriy The Tree of Voices. The voices of our ancestors. I can hear them They live Jake. Within Eywa. You are Omaticaya now. You may make your bow from the wood of Hometree. And you may choose a woman. We have many fine women. Nenat is the best singer. I don't want Nenat. Paral is good hunter. Yes, she is a good hunter. I've already chosen. But this woman must also choose me. She already has. I'm with you now Jake. We are mated for life. What the hell are you doing Jake? Don't forget the phase integration, middle button. You got to eat something. Jake! Wake up. Jake please! Don't make me force feed a cripple. There, I'm done, let's go. And when was the last time you took a shower? I don't need a shower. - Jesus Marine. Jake! Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up! Hey! Stop! Hey boss... What? - I got a native doing a funky chicken here. He's blocking my blade. Keep going, he'll move. These people have to learn that we don't stop. Come on, go, go go .. Stop! Go! Go! There, see, he moved. Woah, woah, ... Dude, woah, dude, no! Oh! I'm blind! Jake! - Neytiri! Come on! Freeze it, right there! Scale up, enhance. Son of a bitch. Unbelievable. Get me a pilot. - Yes sir. You do not speak here! Don't do this! You! - Listen, brother... You mated with the human! - Oh shit... Is this true? We are mated before Eywa. It is done. Brother please, do not attack the sky people. Many Omatacaya will die if you do. - You are not my brother! And I am not your enemy! The enemy is out there! And they are very powerful! I can talk to them! - No more talk! I am Omaticaya, I am one of you. And I have the right to speak. These words are like stones in my heart. Sir, I'm sorry. You can't interrupt a link in progress. It's very dangerous! Grace! Wait! - Stay down sir! Look, ... I was sent here to ... Are you out of your Goddamned mind?! - You crossed the line. Wheel this meat out of here. Jake! What the hell is going on here? You let me down son. So what, you... You found yourself some local tail and you completely forget what team you're playing for? Parker, there is time to salvage this situation... Shut your pie hole! Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me? - I could do that. You need to muzzle your dog. Can we take this down a couple of notches please? You say you want to keep your people alive? Start by listening to her. Those trees were sacred to Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine. You know what? You throw a stick in the air around here it's gonna land on some sacred fern for Christ's sake. I'm not talking about some kind of pagan voodoo I'm talking about something real, something measurable in a biology of the forest. Which is what exactly? What we think we know, is that there's some kind of electro chemical communication between the roots of the trees. Like synapses between neurons. And each tree has 10 to the fourth connections to the trees around it. And there are 10 to the tvelfth trees on Pandora. Which is a lot, I'm guessing. It's more connections than the human brain. Get it? It's a network. It's a global network, and the Na'vi can access it. They can upload and download data. Memories, at sites like the one you just destroyed. Yes! What the hell have you people been smoking out there? They're just Goddamn trees. You need to wake up Parker. - No, you need to wake up. The wealth of this world isn't in the ground, it's all around us. The Na'vi know that, and they're fighting to defend it If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them. I'd say we understand them just fine, thanks to Jake here. Hey Doc, come take a look. They're not gonna give up their home. They're not gonna make a deal. For light beer? And blue jeans? There's nothing that we have that they want. Everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time. They're never gonna leave Hometree. Since a deal can't be made I guess things get real simple, Jake. Thanks. I'm getting all emotional. I might just give you big wet kiss. I'll do with minimal casualties to indigenous. I'll drive them out with gas first. It'll be humane. More or less. Alright, let's pull the trigger. This is how it's done. When people are sitting on shit you want, you make them your enemy, then you justify taking it. Quatrich just rolled in the gunships. He's gonna hit Hometree. - My God. Dr. Augustine, you cannot be up here! Back off! Parker, wait, stop, These are people you're about to... They're fly bitten savages that live in a tree. Alright, look around. I don't know about you but I see a lot of trees. They can move. Can you guys just please... - There are families in there. There are children, babies... Are you gonna kill children? You don't want that kind of blood on your hands, believe me. Let me try to talk them out. They trust me. Calibrate the path. We're going in right now.  Calibrating 3 and 4 Run sequence -Initiating 30 seconds Listen to me, you've got one hour. Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the axe comes down you get them to evacuate. One hour. Tell them they're gonna be here soon. You have to leave, or you're gonna die. Are you certain of this? They sent me here... to learn your ways. So one day I could bring this message, and that you would believe it. What are you saying Jake? You knew this would happen? Yes. At first, it was just orders. And then, everything changed. I fell in love. I fell in love with the forest. With the Omaticaya people. With you. I trusted you. - Trust me now, please. You will never be one of the people! He tried to stop them! You have to go, they are coming! Run to the forest! - They're coming! They want to destroy this place. Neytiri, you must go now. Get to the forest! Run! Run! Goddamn it, run! That is one big damn tree. Well, well, well ... I'd say diplomacy has failed. Alright people, let's get this done. I want every gas round you got right in the front door. Roger, CS-40's going hot. Fire. - Firing. Bingo, good shooting ace. Sir, they've opened fire. You got to be kidding me. These dumb bastards ain't getting the message. Let's turn up the heat. Switch incendiaries. Fire. And that's how you scatter the roaches. Neytiri... We gotta move, he's gonna blow the columns! Moat, no! If you are one of us... Help us. All call signs switch missiles. Give me HE to the base of the West columns. This way! Yeah baby, get some! Bring it down. Come on Grace, move! Get down! Screw this. What the hell are you doing? I didn't sign up for this shit! Go! Go! Go! Good work people. First round's on me tonight. Let's boogie. Neytiri! I'm sorry. Get away! Get away from here! Never come back! Pull the plug. You can't do that! I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace. Sooner or lather though... You always have to wake up. You murderers! What's going on brother? Long time no see. Personally I don't feel these tree hugging traitors deserve steak. They got steak? That's bullshit. Let me see that. Yeah, you know what that is. Down. Trudy - All the way down. Max! Trudy, fire up the ship. Here. Clear, come on. Here you go. Max, stay here. I need someone on the inside I can trust. Okay, go. Clear. Come on baby. Colonel, sir. I got a situation here. It's sector 1-6 Unauthorized engine start. Come on! Mask on! I'm taking fire, let's go! Colonel! Crap. Everybody all right back there? - Yeah baby. Norm, you good? - Yeah. This is gonna ruin my whole day. Grace is hit. - What? Get the trauma kit. Keep the pressure on Grace. Trauma kit's forward, on the bulk head. Hang on Grace. - Doesn't matter. It's fine. Good to go? - Take it up. Hold on. You're clear! Keep going north, get us deep into the mountains. Copy that. Norm, you all good up there? Yup, still here. At least they can't track us up here. Not this far into the vortex. It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right? Yeah. - Good. Cause that's where we're going. Ouch! You big baby. Are we moving? I'm gonna get you some help Grace. I'm a scientist, remember? I don't believe in fairy tales. The people can help you, I know it. Why would they help us? The people say, Eywa will provide. But no home, no hope... There was only one place they could go. Link's running. What's the plan here Jake? There's no plan. Tsu'Tey is the chief now. He's not gonna let you near that place. I've got to try. Launching. Outcast... Betrayer... Alien... I was in the place, the eye does not see. I needed their help. and they needed mine. But to ever face them again... I was gonna have to take it to a whole new level. Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move. There's something we gotta do. You're not going to like it. The way I had it figured, Turok is the baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks him. Easy boy. So why would he ever look up? That was just a theory. I see you. I see you. I was afraid Jake. For my people. I'm not any more. You are the leader. And a great warrior. I can't do this without you. Toruk Makto. I will fly with you. My friend is dying. Grace is dying. I beg the help of Eywa. Look where we are Grace. I need to take some samples. Great Mother may choose to save all that she is... In this body. Is that possible. She must pass through the eye of Eywa, and return. But Jake Sully... She is very weak. Hold on Grace. They're gonna fix you up. Jake... Grace... I'm with her Jake. She's real. Grace. Grace. What's happening? Grace. Grace... What's happening? Did it work? Her wounds were too great. It was not enough time. She is with Eywa now. With your permission, I will speak now. You would honor me by translating. The sky people have sent us a message... That they can take whatever they want. And no one can stop them. But we will send them a message. You ride out as fast as the wind can carry you. We tell the other clans to come. You tell that Turok Makto calls to them. You fly now! With me! My brothers, sisters... And we will show the sky people. That they can not take whatever they want! And that this, this is our land! We rode out to the four winds... To the horse clans of the plain... To the Ikran people of the eastern sea. When Turok Makto called them, they came. Everyone on this base, everyone of you is fighting for survival, and that's a fact. There's aboriginal horde out there, massing for an attack. These orbital images tell me, that the hostiles numbers have gone from few hundred to well over two thousand in one day. And more are pouring in. In a weeks time, there could be 20.000 of them. At that point they will overrun our perimeter. That's not gonna happen. Our only security lies in preemptive attack. We will fight terror with terror. Now the hostiles believe that this mountain stronghold of theirs is protected by their Deity. And when we destroy it... We will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep that hey won't come within a 1000 clicks of this place ever again. And that too, is a fact. Jake it's crazy here, full mobilization. They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber. They got these huge palettes of mine explosives for some shock and awe campaign. Freakin daisy cutters. Quaritch has taken over, he's rolling them and there's no stopping him. When? - 06:00 tomorrow. I got to go. We're screwed. And I was hoping for some sort of tactical plan that didn't envolve martyrdom. We're going up against gunships with bows and arrows. I have 15 clans out there. That's over 2000 warriors. We know these mountains. We fly them, You fly them. They don't. Their instruments won't work up here. Missile tracking, won't work. They'll have to fire a line of sight. If they bring the fight to us... then we have the home field advantage. You know he's gonna commit that bomber staight to the Tree of Souls. I know. If they get to it, it's over. That's their direct line to Eywa, their ancestors. It'll destroy them. Then I guess we better stop them. I'm probably just talking to a tree right now. But if you're there... I need to give you a heads up. If Grace is with you... Look into her memories. See the world we come from. There's no green there. They killed their mother. And they're gonna do the same here. More sky people are gonna come. They're gonna come like rain that never ends. Unless we stop them. You chose me for something. I will stand and fight. You know I will. But I need a little help here. Our Great Mother does not take sides Jake. She protects only the balance of life. It was worth a try. This is group leader, we're entering the flux vortex. Switch to manual flight mode. This is papa dragon. I want this mission high and tight. I want to be home for dinner. Suit team, go. Alright ladies, let's bring the pain. Eyes up, check that overhead. Watch those thermal scans. All call signs, papa has lead. Pushing the target. Escorts, be close on my shuttle. We are gonna lose some paint in here. Gun crews keep your head on a swivel. Make no mistake people, they're out there. Alright people, target in sight. Range four clicks. Valkirye 1-6, get your payload ready. Push to the ramp! Hold position, we got movement out there. Hold position. Sir, ground has movement. Fire in line! - Targets closing. Range 400 meters. Can't you clean it up? - No sir, it's the flux. Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole, you follow me through. All aircrafts, weapons free. Brake right, come around. Break formation. Engage all hostiles. Scorpions, pursue and destroy. Jake, Jake you copy? We're falling back! We're getting hammered! Copy, get out of there. That's him, get after him! Take him out! Oops. Light her up! You're not the only one with a gun bitch. Keep her in your sights! That's it! Rogue 1 is hit! I'm going in! Sorry Jake. Fire. Tsu'Tey, brother do you read? Rogue 1, you copy? Trudy? Time to target, 2 minutes. - Valkyrie 1-6, you are clear in hot. Copy dragon, we are starting our bomb run. Fire number one! Number one armed! Jake! I read you! Neytiri. They are very close, there are many. Do not attack. Do you read me Neytiri? Do not attack! Fall back now, get out of there. That's an order! Neytiri! I've got movement. Hold position. Something's coming. We've got movement, 200 meters. Get ready. Get out of here! Fall back! Jake! Eywa has heard you. Eywa has heard you! Sir, all escorts are down or falling back. Let's get this done. Valkirye 1-6, this is dragon, press the target. Copy, pressing the target. Stand by to drop, 30 seconds. On my mark, 2, 1, mark. Drop! It's Sully! Masks on! - Breach alarm! Come on, come to papa. Give it up Quaritch. It's all over. Nothing's over while I'm breathing. I kinda hoped you'd say that. Come on! Sully, how does it feel to betray your own race? You think you're one of them? Time to wake up. Jake! Jake... Jake... Jake! My Jake! I see you. I see you. The aliens went back to their dying world. Only a few were chosen to stay. The time of Great Sorrow was ending. Toruk Makto was no longer needed. Well, I guess this is my last video log. Whatever happens tonight... Either way, I'm not gonna be coming back to this place. Well I guess I better go. I don't want to be late for my own party. It's my birthday after all. This is Jake Sully signing off.  subz by majortjkong, NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER: Movietown News presents Spotlight on Adventure.

Keep coming. And stop. Stop. Stop! Why... Hey! Hey, you! What do you... What do you think you're doing? - I am so sorry, sir. - Don't touch that! No, no, no. Let me take care of that for you. - Get away from our mailbox! - Hey. Sir, I... I don't want you to touch it! Ow! MAN: Steve, you all right? OFFICER EDITH: Sorry, Mr. Fredricksen. You don't seem like a public menace to me. Take this. The guys from Shady Oaks will be by to pick you up in the morning, okay? What do I do now, Ellie? Morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen. You ready to go? Ready as I'll ever be. Would you do me a favor and take this? I'll meet you at the van in just a minute. I wanna say one last goodbye to the old place. Sure. Take all the time you need, sir. That's typical. He's probably going to the bathroom for the 80th time. (SCOFFS) You think he'd take better care of his house. So long, boys! I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls! Heh! We're on our way, Ellie. Huh? Hmm. Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It's me, Russell. What are you doing out here, kid? I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse. Please let me in. No. Oh, alright, you can come... Huh. I've never been in a floating house before. Goggles. Look at this stuff. Wow! You're going on a trip? ""Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."" You're going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen? Don't touch that! You'll soil it. You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you will have all your TV and clocks and stuff. Whoa. Is this how you steer your house? Does it really work? Kid, would you stop with the... - This makes it go right. - Let go of that... - And that way's left. - Knock it off! Hey, look! Buildings. That building's so close I could almost touch it. RUSSELL: Wow! This is great! You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen. Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away! Hey! I can see your house from here. Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoa! Well, that's not gonna work. I know that cloud. It's a cumulonimbus. Did you know that the cumulonimbus forms when warm air rises over cool air? Stayed up all night blowing up balloons... for what? ...and that's how we get lightning. - That's nice, kid. - Mr. Fredricksen? (MUTED) There's a storm coming. It's starting to get scary. We're gonna get blown to bits! We're in big trouble... - What are you doing over there? - Look. See? Cumulonimbus. My pack! Got ya! I thought you were dead. What happened? I steered us. I did. I steered the house. Steered us? After you tied your stuff down, you took a nap. So I went ahead and steered us down here. Yeah. Sure. Can't tell where we are. Oh, we're in South America, all right. It was a cinch with my Wilderness Explorer GPS. - GP... What? - My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet. With this baby, we'll never be lost! Oops. We'll get you down, find a bus stop, you just tell the man you wanna go back to your mother. Sure, but I don't think they have buses in Paradise Falls. There. That ought to do it. Here, I'll give you some change for bus fare. RUSSELL: No, I'll just use my city bus pass. RUSSELL: Whoa. That's gonna be like a billion transfers to get back to my house. Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer? Well, we're up pretty high. Could take hours to get down. That thing was... building or something. What was that, Mr. Fredricksen? We can't be close to the ground yet. Wait! Wait, no, don't! Don't, don't! Wait, wait. Wait! - Russell, hang on! Hey! - RUSSELL: Whoa! Whoa! Aaaagggghhhhh! - CARL: Walk back. Walk back. - Okay. CARL: Come on. Come on. Where... Where are we? This doesn't look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen. Don't worry, Ellie. I got it. There it is. Ellie, it's so beautiful. We made it. We made it! Russell! We could float right over there! Climb up. Climb up! You mean, assist you? - Yeah, yeah. Whatever. - Okay. I'll climb up. CARL: Watch it! RUSSELL: Sorry. Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up! Got it? You on the porch yet? What? That's it? I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile? Great. Hey, if I could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge? - What are you talking about? - We could walk your house to the falls. - Walk it? - Yeah! After all, we weigh it down. We could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon. CARL: Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly - with no rap music or flash dancing. - RUSSELL: Uh-huh. We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we're not at the falls when that happens... - Sand. ...we're not getting to the falls. I found sand! Don't you worry, Ellie. We'll get our house over there. RUSSELL: This is fun already, isn't it? By the time we get there, you're gonna feel so assisted. Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call. Caw, caw! Raar! RUSSELL: Wait. Why are we going to Paradise Falls again? CARL: Hey, let's play a game. It's called ""see who can be quiet the longest."" RUSSELL: Cool! My mom loves that game! Darn thing! Come on, Russell. Would you hurry it up? I'm tired. And my knee hurts. Which knee? My elbow hurts, and I have to go to the bathroom. I asked you about that five minutes ago. Well, I didn't have to go then! (MUFFLED) I don't wanna walk anymore. Can we stop? Russell, if you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you. There are no tigers in South America. Zoology. Oh, for the love of Pete! Go on into the bushes and do your business. Okay! Here! Hold my stuff. I've always wanted to try this. RUSSELL: Mr. Fredricksen, am I supposed to dig the hole before or after? None of my concern! RUSSELL: Oh. It's before! Bah! La la la la la! Huh? Tracks? Snipe. Here, snipe. Come on out, snipe. Snipe. Huh? Ha! Gotcha! Don't be afraid, little snipe. I am a Wilderness Explorer, so I'm a friend to all of nature. Want some more? Hi, boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out. Come on. Come on. Don't be afraid, little snipe. Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice... Giant snipe. - I found the snipe! - Oh! Did you? - Are they tall? - Oh, yes, they're very tall. - Do they have a lot of colors? - They do, indeed! - Do they like chocolate? - Oh, yes... chocolate? - Gah! What is that thing? - It's a snipe! There's no such thing as a snipe! - But you said snipes eat your... Whoa! - Hey! Go on! Get out of here! Go on! RUSSELL: Whoa! Whoa! Careful, Russell! (GIGGLING) Hey, look, Mr. Fredricksen. It likes me. Whoa! - Russell! - No, stop! That tickles. CARL: Get out of here! Go on! Get! Uh-oh. No, no, no! Kevin! It's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice. - Kevin? - Yeah. That's his name I just gave him. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram! Hey! That's mine! Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here! Go on! Beat it! RUSSELL: Can we keep him? Please? I'll get the food for him. I'll walk him. I'll change his newspapers. CARL: No. ""An Explorer is a friend to all, be it plants or fish or tiny mole."" - That doesn't even rhyme. - Yeah, it does. - Hey, look. Kevin. - What? Get down! You're not allowed up there! You come down here right now! Sheesh! Can you believe this, Ellie? Ellie? Hey, Ellie! Could I keep the bird? RUSSELL: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. She said for you to let me. But I told him no. I told you no! N-O. I see you back there. Go on! Get out of here! Shoo! Go annoy someone else for a while. DUG: Hey, are you okay over there? Uh... Hello? CARL: Oh! Hello, sir! Thank goodness. It's nice to know someone else is up here. DUG: I can smell you. What? You can smell us? DUG: I can smell you. Hey. (SNICKERS) You were talking to a rock. Hey, that one looks like a turtle. Look at that one! That one looks like a dog. - It is a dog! - What? We're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment. Hey, I like dogs. We have your dog! - Whoa! - Wonder who he belongs to. Sit, boy. Hey, look, he's trained. Shake. Uh-huh. - Speak. - DUG: Hi, there. Did that dog just say ""Hi, there""? DUG: Oh, yes. My name is Dug. I have just met you, and I love you. My master made me this collar. He is a good and smart master, and he made me this collar so that I may talk. Squirrel! My master is good and smart. It's not possible. DUG: Oh, it is, because my master is smart. - Cool! What do these do, boy? - DUG: Hey, would you... DUG: I use that collar... ...to talk with. I would be happy if you stopped. Russell, don't touch that! It could be radioactive or something! DUG: I am a great tracker. My pack sent me on a special mission all by myself. Have you seen a bird? I want to find one, and I've been on the scent. I am a great tracker. Did I mention that? DUG: Hey, that is the bird. I have never seen one up close, but this is the bird. May I take your bird back to camp as my prisoner? Yes, yes, take it. And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog. DUG: I can bark. And here's howling. Can we keep him? Please, please, please! - No. - But it's a talking dog! It's just a weird trick or something. Let's get to the falls. DUG: Please be my prisoner. Oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner! GAMMA: Oh! Here it is. I picked up the bird's scent! BETA: Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is this? Chocolate. I smell chocolate. GAMMA: I'm getting prunes and denture cream! Who are they? BETA: Oh, man, Master will not be pleased. We better tell him someone took the bird. Right, Alpha? ALPHA: (IN SQUEAKY VOICE) No. Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again. Find the scent, my compadres, and you too shall have much rewardings from Master for the toil factor you wage. BETA: Hey, Alpha, I think there's something wrong with your collar. You must've bumped it. GAMMA: Yeah, your voice sounds funny! ALPHA: Beta! Gamma! Mayhaps you desire to... Squirrel! ALPHA: Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning. BETA: No, no, no. But maybe Dug would. You might wanna ask him. GAMMA: Yeah. I wonder if he's found the bird on his very special mission. ALPHA: Do not mention Dug to me at this time. His fool's errand will keep him most occupied. Most occupied indeed. Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now? BETA: Sure, but the second Master finds out you sent Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat. ALPHA: (GROWLS) You are wise, my trusted lieutenant. This is Alpha calling Dug. Come in, Dug. DUG: (WHISPERING) Hi, Alpha. Hey, your voice sounds funny. ALPHA: I know, I know! Have you seen the bird? DUG: Why, yes. The bird is my prisoner now. GAMMA: Yeah, right! ALPHA: Impossible! Where are you? DUG: I am here with the bird, and I will bring it back, and then you will like me. - Gotta go. - Hey, Dug, who you talking to? ALPHA: No, wait, wait! BETA: What's Dug doing? GAMMA: Why's he with that small mailman? BETA: Where are they? ALPHA: There he is. Come on! DUG: Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner. RUSSELL: Dug, stop bothering Kevin! DUG: That man there says I can take the bird, and I love that man there like he is my master. CARL: I am not your master! DUG: I am warning you once again, bird. - Hey! Quit it! - DUG: I am jumping on you now, bird. Russell, at this rate, we'll never get to the falls. DUG: Here, bird. I am nobody's master, got it? I don't want you here, and I don't want you here! I'm stuck with you! And if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three... DUG: A ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy! A ball! Ball? Yeah, yeah? You want it, boy? Huh? Huh? Yeah. Yeah? DUG: Yes, I do! I do ever so want the ball. - Go get it! - DUG: Oh, boy! Oh, boy! I will get it and then bring it back! Quick, Russell. Give me some chocolate. - Why? - Just give it to me! Bird. Bird! Come on, Russell. Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen. RUSSELL: What are we doing? Hey, we're pretty far now. Kevin's gonna miss me. I think that did the trick. DUG: Hi, Master. Afternoon. Well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway, Ellie. Which one's the front? Oh, boy. Is this step three or step five? RUSSELL: There. All done! That's for you. Oh... Tents are hard. Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy, with the GPMs and the badges? Yeah, but can I tell you a secret? - No. - All right. Here it goes. I never actually built a tent before. There, I said it. You've been camping before, haven't you? Well, never outside. Well, why didn't you ask your dad how to build a tent? I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff. Well, why don't you try him sometime. Maybe he'll surprise you. Well, he's away a lot. I don't see him much. He's gotta be home sometime. Well, I call, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much. Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name? Phyllis isn't my mom. Oh. But he promised he'd come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge. So, he can show me about tents then, right? Hey, why don't you get some sleep? Don't wanna wake up the traveling flea circus. Mr. Fredricksen? Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner. We have to protect him. Can Kevin go with us? All right, he can come. Promise you won't leave him? - Yeah. - Cross your heart? Cross my heart. What have I got myself into, Ellie? Morning, sweetheart. We better get moving. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell won't notice. All right, everybody up! Where's Kevin? He's wandered off! Kevin! Dug, find Kevin! DUG: Find the bird, find the bird! Hi, hi. Point! Look. There he is! DUG: Point! Hey! That's my food! Get off my roof! DUG: Yeah, get off of his... What is it doing? DUG: The bird is calling to her babies. Her babies. Kevin's a girl? DUG: Her house is over there in those twisty rocks. She has been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them. Wait. Kevin's just leaving? But you promised to protect her. Her babies need her. We gotta make sure they're together! Sorry, Russell. We've lost enough time already. Yeah. This was her favorite chocolate. Because you sent her away, there's more for you. Huh? Kevin? ALPHA: Where's the bird? You said you had the bird. DUG: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have said that, I can see how you would think that. ALPHA: Where is it? DUG: Uh... Tomorrow. Come back tomorrow, and then I will again have the bird. Yes. ALPHA: You lost it! Why do I not have a surprised feeling? Well, at least you now have led us to the small mailman and the one who smells of prunes. ALPHA: Master will be most pleased we have found them and will ask of them many questions. Come! Wait. We're not going with you! We're going to the falls! Get away from me! CARL: Get down! MUNTZ: Stay! You came here in that? Uh, yeah. MUNTZ: In a house? A floating house? That is the darnedest thing I've ever seen. You're not after my bird, are you? But if you needed to borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige. Well, this is all a misunderstanding. My dogs made a mistake. Wait. Are you Charles Muntz? Yeah, well, yes. THE Charles Muntz? ""Adventure is out there!"" It's really him! That's Charles Muntz! - It is? Who's Charles Muntz? - Him! - DOGS: Yes! Yes! That's him! - I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were your biggest fans. Oh, well. You're a man of good taste. Now, you must be tired. Hungry? Uh-huh. Now, attention, everyone! These people are no longer intruders! They are our guests. DOG 1: Follow me. I like you temporarily. You do smell like prunes. CARL: Whoa! DOG 2: I will not bite you. DOG 3: The small mailman smells like chocolate. MUNTZ: I'm sorry about the dogs. - Hope they weren't too rough on you. - GAMMA: We weren't. MUNTZ: Go ahead and moor your airship right next to mine. We're not actually going inside the Spirit of Adventure itself? Oh... Would you like to? Would I? CARL: Wait up, Mr. Muntz. Jiminy Cricket. BETA: Not you. GAMMA: What do we do with Dug? ALPHA: He has lost the bird. Put him in the Cone of Shame. DUG: I do not like the Cone of Shame. MUNTZ: Well, most of the collection is housed in the world's top museums, New York, Munich, London. Of course, I kept the best for myself. Did you ever! Will you look at that? MUNTZ: Oh, yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast charged while I was brushing my teeth. Used my shaving kit to bring him down. Oh, yeah. Well, surprise me. Only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared as dental equipment. Oh, my gosh! The giant Somalian leopard tortoise! Oh, you recognize it. I'm impressed. That's an interesting story there. Excellent choice. I found it on safari with Roosevelt. He and I fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings, and did he cheat! Oh, he was horrible. ALPHA: Master, dinner is ready. Oh, dear. Broken translator. It's that loose wire again. There you go, big fella. ALPHA: (IN DEEP VOICE) Thank you, Master. I liked his other voice. Well, dinner is served. Right this way. So, how are things stateside, huh? Almost tempted to go back a few times, but I have unfinished work here. Please. I hope you're hungry, because Epsilon is the finest chef I've ever had. Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again! Yes! Hey! Hey! Oh, my Ellie would've loved all this. You know, it's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by Paradise Falls. I'm honored. And now you've made it. You're sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose. No, no. It's a pleasure to have guests, a real treat. DOG 1: Treat! Where's the treat! DOG 2: Treat! MUNTZ: No, no. Quiet! Calm down, calm down. - DOG 3: I want a treat! I want a treat! - Hey! I shouldn't have used that word. Having guests is a delight. More often I get thieves come to steal what's rightfully mine. No! They called me a fraud, those... But once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared. Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a lifetime tracking it. Sometimes years go by between sightings. I've tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives. You can't go in after it. Once in, there's no way out. I've lost so many dogs. And here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take. But they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place. Hey, that looks like Kevin. - Kevin? - Yeah, that's my new giant bird pet. I trained it to follow us. Follow you? It's impossible. How? - She likes chocolate. - Chocolate? Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes gaga for it. But it ran off. It's gone now. You know, Carl, these people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories. A surveyor making a map. A botanist cataloguing plants. An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls. I mean, that's the best one yet. I can't wait to hear how it ends. Well, it's been a wonderful evening, but we better be going. Oh, you're not leaving. We don't want to take advantage of your hospitality. - Come on, Russell. - But we haven't even had dessert yet. The boy's right. You haven't had dessert. Epsilon here makes a delicious cherries jubilee. Oh, you really must stay. I insist. We have so much more to talk about. Kevin? It's here. Get them! - Hurry! - RUSSELL: I am hurrying! Ahhh! They're coming! DUG: Master, over here. DUG: Go toward the light, Master! Russell! Get back! DUG: Go on, Master! I will stop the dogs! Stop, you dogs. Whoa! RUSSELL: Help! Help! Caw, caw! Raar! Caw, caw! Raar! Give me your hand! Hang on to Kevin! RUSSELL: Kevin. Oh, no, no, no. Kevin. Stay down. She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home? All right, but we gotta hurry. You lost them? BETA: No, it was Dug. GAMMA: Yeah. He's with them. He helped them escape! Wait. Wait a minute. Dug. See anything? DUG: No. My pack is not following us. Boy, they are dumb. This is crazy. I finally meet my childhood hero, and he's trying to kill us. What a joke! DUG: Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel walks up to a tree and says, ""I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead."" Ha! It is funny because the squirrel gets dead. CARL: Careful, Russell. You okay, Kevin? You know what, Mr. Fredricksen? The wilderness isn't quite what I expected. CARL: Yeah? How so? It's kind of wild. I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book. (SCOFFS) Get used to that, kid. My dad made it sound so easy. He's really good at camping and how to make fire from rocks and stuff. He used to come to all my Sweat Lodge meetings. And afterwards, we'd go get ice cream at Fentons. I always get chocolate and he gets butter brickle. Then we sit on this one curb right outside, and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most wins. I like that curb. That might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most. Look! There it is! Hey, kid. Hold on, Russell. Stand still. Look at that bird go. Wait up, you overgrown chicken. That's it. Go, Kevin! Go find your babies! Run, Kevin! Run! Oh, no! Russell, give me your knife! MUNTZ: Get away from my bird! No! RUSSELL: No! MUNTZ: Careful. We'll want her in good shape for my return. RUSSELL: Let her go! Stop! Kevin! RUSSELL: You gave away Kevin. You just gave her away. This is none of my concern. I didn't ask for any of this! DUG: Master, it's alright. I am not your master! And if you hadn't have shown up, none of this would've happened! Bad dog! Bad dog! Now, whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me. Here. I don't want this anymore. Russell? Russell! I'm gonna help Kevin, even if you won't! No, Russell! No! Huh? Russell? Dug! DUG: I was hiding under your porch because I love you. Can I stay? Can you stay? Well, you're my dog, aren't you? And I'm your master. DUG: You're my master? Oh, boy! Oh, boy! CARL: Good boy, Dug! You're a good boy! Yes! Don't worry, Kevin. I'll save... And they wouldn't believe me. Just wait till they get a look at you. ALPHA: Master? - The small mailman has returned. - What? Let me go. Where's your elderly friend? He's not my friend anymore. Well, if you're here, Fredricksen can't be far behind. RUSSELL: Where are you keeping Kevin? Let me go! BETA: Scream all you want, small mailman. GAMMA: None of your mailman friends can hear you. I'll unleash all my Wilderness Explorer training! MUNTZ: Alpha, Fredricksen's coming back. Guard that bird. If you see the old man, you know what to do. Hey, where are you going? I'm not finished with you! MUNTZ: Nice talking with you. Ahhh! Where are you, Fredricksen? Russell! - Mr. Fredricksen! - Dug, bring her over! You came back for Kevin! Let's go get her! CARL: I'm getting Kevin. You stay here. But I wanna help. I don't want your help. I want you safe. How do we get past these dogs? DUG: Point! Kevin. Don't worry, Kevin. We're on our way. ALPHA: Allow no one to be entering through these doors. Guard well that bird, my minions. What do we do now, Dug? Who wants the ball? DOG 1: Me! I want it! DOG 2: Me! I do! DOG 3: I want the ball! DOG 4: Give it to me! Then go get it! GAMMA: I'm gonna get there first! GAMMA: Getting the ball! GAMMA: I got it! Uh-oh. I'm sorry, Kevin. Let's get you out of here. GAMMA: Master! He's gone! The old man! DOG 1: He's here! GAMMA: He's got the bird! DOG 2: The bird's gone... Calm down! One at a time! I... want... to... help! Ha-ha! DOG 3: He's in Hall D! DOG 4: He's in Hall C! DOG 5: It's the old man! Does anyone know where they are? Gray Leader? Take down the house. BETA: Gray Leader, checking in. GAMMA: Gray Two, checking in. GRAY THREE: Gray Three, checking in. BETA: Target sighted. Come on, Kevin. Auuggghh! DUG: Hi. Any last words, Fredricksen? Come on! Spit it out! - Come on. - Enough! I am taking that bird back with me. Alive or dead! Come on, Kevin. ALPHA: I will have many enjoyments from what I am about to do, Dug. DOG 1: He wears the Cone of Shame! ALPHA: (IN SQUEAKY VOICE) What? Do not just continue sitting. Attack! ALPHA: No, no! Stop your laughing! Get this off of me! DUG: Listen, you dog. Sit! ALL: Yes, Alpha. DUG: Alpha? I am not Alpha. He is... Oh! I can't do it. - CARL: Russell! - Huh? CARL: Caw, caw! Raar! Caw, caw! Raar! You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone! Hey, squirrel! GAMMA: Squirrel? Where? Where? Where? BETA: Where's the squirrel? GAMMA: I hate squirrels. Dug! DUG: Master! Russell! Over here! Let's go! Mr. Fredricksen! CARL: Go on, Kevin! No! Russell! Get out of there! No! Leave them alone! Russell, hang on to Kevin! Don't let go of her! Kevin! Chocolate! RUSSELL: That was cool! Don't jerk around so much, kid! Easy, Russell. DUG: Oh, I am ready to not be up high. Sorry about your house, Mr. Fredricksen. You know, it's just a house. Look at you. You're so soft. ALL: Aw! I wish I could keep one. Where's my cane? I just had it here. You know what? Keep them. A little gift from me to you. Bye, Kevin! Ready? Ready. STRAUCH: And by receiving their badges, the following Explorers will graduate to Senior Explorers. For Extreme Mountaineering Lore. Congratulations, Jimmy. For Wild Animal Defensive Arts. Congratulations, Brandon. For Assisting the Elderly... Uh, Russell, is there someone that... Excuse me. Pardon me. Old man coming through. I'm here for him. Congratulations, Russell. Sir. Russell, for Assisting the Elderly and for performing above and beyond the call of duty, I would like to award you the highest honor I can bestow. The Ellie badge. Wow. STRAUCH: All right, I think that covers everybody. So let's give a big Explorer call to our brand new Senior Wilderness Explorers. Ready, everybody? ALL: Caw, caw! Raar! Caw, caw! Raar! - Blue one. - Red one. - Blue one. - DUG: Gray one. - Red one. - RUSSELL: That's a bike. CARL: It's red, isn't it? RUSSELL: Mr. Fredricksen, you're cheating. CARL: No, I'm not. Red one. RUSSELL: That's a fire hydrant. CARL: Maybe I need new glasses. RUSSELL: Another blue one. Adventure is out there It's heading our way So grab your scarf and goggles Let's fly I've mapped out our journey We're up here to stay A sunset is our home A moonbeam we will own My spirit of adventure is you Freaks of nature span a globe That's too big to deny With canine guards we'll travel there and spit into their eye Bang, bang Once the smoke has cleared After all the crowds have cheered We'll make it a joint venture Before we're in our dentures My spirit of adventure is you Adventure is out there Let's crack some champagne I've hung a hundred heads on my wall To say that I'm traveled is far too mundane Let's grab our aero-fare The high-brows will be there The spirit of adventure is something to indenture My spirit of adventure is you, Five thousand years ago... a fierce warrior known as the Scorpion King... led a great army on a campaign... to conquer the known world. After a vicious campaign which lasted seven long years... the Scorpion King and his army were defeated... and driven deep into the sacred desert of Ahm Shere. One by one, they slowly perished under the scorching sun... until only the great warrior himself was left alive. Near death... the Scorpion King made a pact with the dark god Anubis... that if Anubis would spare his life... and let him conquer his enemies... he would give him his soul. Anubis accepted his offer and spared his life. Anubis gave the Scorpion King command of his army... and like an evil flood, they washed away... all that lay before them. When his task was done... Anubis forced the Scorpion King to serve him for all time. His army was returned to the sands from whence they came... where they wait, silently... to be awakened once again. Alex? What were you thinking, a mummy had come back to life? I'll tell you a story some time. What are you doing down here? I told you to wait for us in the temple. It's dangerous down here. - But I saw your tattoo. - You saw what? On a wall by the entrance. There's a cartouche just like it. With the pyramid and the eye... and the two kings and everything. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. Well, I'll be up to take a look at that in a minute. In the meantime, I want you to wait for us up there. Pick up your stuff, and I'll see you up in the temple. Go on. And what should I do? I don't know. Surprise me. - Build a better mousetrap. - Okay. While your mother goes and desecrates another tomb. Go away. - Those are poisonous, you know. - Only if they bite you. What was all that about? Nothing. Alex wanted to show me something. I swear... the kid gets more and more like you every day. You mean more attractive, sweet... and devilishly charming? No, he's driving me crazy. Now, where were we? Hammer and chisel. All right, all right! Let's do it your way. Thank you. Ever since I had that dream... this place is all I can think about. Ever since you had that dream, I haven't had a decent night of sleep. I feel like I've been here before. I know I've been here before. Evy, nobody's been here before, not in at least 3,000 years. Except for these guys. Then how do I seem to know exactly where I'm going? Let's go. Knock, knock. Anybody home? You two check out that stuff, see if it's there. I'll sort out the O'Connells. If you move that fast enough, you can almost write your name. I just had a vision. It was like my dream, but it was real. It was like I was actually here in ancient times. Well, if you actually were here... could you show me how to open this thing? Hold this. - Now you're starting to scare me. - I'm starting to scare myself. What is this? Look at the state of this rubbish. The Egyptians never had a clue. Look at that stuff. It's all chintz and stuff. Look at that. Cheap pottery, this. Ancient rubbish. Jacques, something's hit me head! Shut up, Spivey. This place is cursed. We do not want to wake the gods. That's the emblem of the Scorpion King. He's supposed to be pure myth. No trace of him has ever been found before. No artefacts. No archival evidence. Maybe they didn't want anybody to find him. - Let's open this. - Evy, I don't know. - I don't have a good feeling about this. - It's only a chest. No harm ever came from opening a chest. Right, and no harm ever came from reading a book. - Remember how that one went? - Come on. We can't stop now. Just remember, I was the voice of reason here. For once. Rubbish. Dreck. Chintz. God, that hurt! Hon? Let's do it your way. The bracelet of Anubis. I'll take care of this. Oh, my God. It's a bit late for that! - Put it in your rucksack. - Let's leave it here. - It's a bit late for that! - What's it say? ""He who disturbs this bracelet... shall drink from the Nile."" That doesn't sound too bad. Jacques is gonna make a nice fillet out of you, my son. Spivey! Jacques! Let's get the hell out of here! Come on. This is bad, Evy. - We've had bad before. - This is worse. Mom? Dad? I can explain everything. The Book of the Dead gives life. And the Book of the Living... takes life away. I thought that was my job. We're getting close. Did you acquire it? We're getting very close. We found him. We found him! We found him! Step aside there. Out of the way. Imhotep. It's him. It's Imhotep. Now we must raise those that serve him. Get out of my way. Get out of the way. Get out of my way or I'm gonna shoot you in the face. He means it. He shot someone before. Give it to me. The opportunity passed us by. - We need that bracelet. - We need it before it opens. Enough. My dear Hafez... I told you I should have handled it. I did not want your past history... to cloud the issue. Don't worry. We know where it is. We'll take care of it. No, we'll take care of it. I have a different chore for you now. Where is the bracelet? It's on its way to merry old London. Then London is where we must go. I think the bracelet is some sort of guide... to the lost oasis of Ahm Shere. Evy, I know what you're thinking... and the answer's no. We just got home. That's the beauty of it. We're already packed. Why don't you just give me one good reason? It's just an oasis... darling. A beautiful... exciting... romantic... oasis. The kind with the white, sandy beach and the palm trees... and the cool, clear, blue water? We could have some of those big drinks with the little umbrellas. - Sounds good. - Sounds too good. What's the catch? Supposedly it's the resting place of Anubis's army. You see? I knew there's a catch. There's always a catch. How did I know that? And let me guess. It was commanded by that Scorpion King guy? Yes, but he only awakens once every 5,000 years. And if someone doesn't kill him, he's gonna wipe out the world. - How did you know? - I didn't, but that's always the story. The last known expedition to actually reach Ahm Shere... was sent by Ramses the Fourth over 3,000 years ago. - He sent over a thousand men. - None of them was ever seen again. - How did you know? - I didn't, but that's always the story. - Did I mention the pyramid of gold? - Twice. Alexander the Great sent troops in search of it. - Hooray for him. - So did Caesar. - Look what happened to his career. - And Napoleon. Yeah, but we're smarter than him. - Taller too. - Exactly. - That's why we're gonna find it. - Because we're taller? - That's why I love you. - Nice try. Mom! What do I do with this chest? Sucker weighs a goddang ton. Alex, watch your language. Rather weighty, this. Evy, that first weird dream of yours was exactly six weeks ago, right? Yes, but what's that got to do with anything? It just happens to coincide with Egyptian New Year. That's right. What a coincidence. Maybe. All I'm saying is let's be cautious. If anything happened to you, I would never forgive myself. You and Alex are the only thing that matter to me. Well... the Bembridge scholars have been begging me... to run the British Museum. Cripes, how do you get this thing off? Have I kissed you today? I hate it when you do that. Why? - Makes me agree to anything. - Anything? Those knickers are not mine. Jonathan. Alex, behave yourself for five minutes, all right? You betcha. - Happy to be home? - Couldn't be happier. It's the Year of the Scorpion. - Neat. - Thought you might like that. So I killed the mummy and his minions and stole his sceptre. Oh, you're so brave. And rich. Did I mention rich? What do you think I'm doing here? - Sorry, we must be in the wrong house. - You said this was your house. - I didn't. - Call me! - You're not Sheila's husband? - No. If you work for Johnny, I was gonna pay him back on Tuesday. I don't know any Johnny. We are looking for the bracelet of Anubis. Oh, good for you. Good thing to have, the old bracelet of Anubis. Where is it? Ah, you're looking here for the bracelet. I see. I have no idea what you're talking about. Mr. O'Connell, you try my patience. Mr. O'Connell? Hold on a minute. You've got the wrong ma... That bracelet. Now I remember. - I lost it in a card game. - For your sake, I hope not. It can't be. - Where's your wife? - My wife? You mean Evy. I think she went off to Baden-Baden or Tibet or something. The girl's a free spirit. Did I mention I was single now? Egyptian asps are quite poisonous. It's downstairs. There's a safe. The combination is 3-20-58. 393-something. It's in the safe downstairs. I told you! And your point is? - I told you so you wouldn't kill me. - When did we make that arrangement? Jonathan, I thought I said no more wild parties. Well, when you're popular... I'm serious. If you've lost that key, you're grounded. I haven't lost it. I just can't find it. There's a difference. Well, you better start finding it then. I will, Mom. There's nothing to worry about. Good evening. Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm looking for the chest, of course. Give it to me now. Get out of my house. Whoa, Mom. - Maybe not the best idea. - Alex, get back there. Definitely not the best idea. I think it's time to yell for Dad now. - I will kill you and take it anyway. - I think not. Ardeth. What are you doing here? Perhaps explanations are best kept for later. Ardeth Bay. Lock-Nah. Hey, folks, knowing my brother-in-law... he probably deserves whatever you're about to do to him... but this is my house. I have certain rules about snakes and dismemberment. Shoot him! Whoa, Mom! - Where did you learn to do that? - I have no idea. That I learned from your father. I'll take that. Not bad for a Medjai. Let go! - What's in the chest? - The bracelet of Anubis! They must not get the bracelet. Get it and get out of here! Mom, look out! Evelyn! What'd you do this time? I haven't done anything to anybody. - Lately. - Come on! Rick! Look out, Rick! Dad! Dad! - Are you all right? - Yeah. What the hell are you doing here? Scratch that. I don't care. Who are those guys and where are they taking my wife? My friend, I'm not sure... but wherever this man is... your wife will surely be. Hey, I know him. He's the curator. - He works at the British Museum. - Are you sure? Better believe him. He spends more time there than he does at home. Okay, you're here. The bad guys are here. Evy's been kidnapped. Let me guess. They once again removed the creature from his grave. Not to point fingers, but isn't it your job to make sure that doesn't happen? That woman with him knows things no living person could possibly know. She knew exactly where the creature was buried. We hoped she would lead us to the bracelet. She obviously did. Now they have it. I wouldn't get too nervous just yet. Is that gold? When I stuck it on, I saw the pyramids at Giza. Then whoosh... straight across the desert to Karnak. You have started a chain reaction that could bring about the next apocalypse. You, lighten up. You, big trouble. You, get in the car. I am sorry if I alarmed your son, but you must understand. Now that the bracelet's on... we have 7 days before the Scorpion King awakens. We? What we? If he is not killed, he will raise the Army of Anubis. - I take it that's not a good thing. - Oh, he'll wipe out the world. The old ""wipe out the world"" ploy. Whomever can kill the Scorpion King... can send his army back to the Underworld... or use it to destroy mankind and rule the Earth. They dug up Imhotep 'cause he's tough enough to take out the Scorpion King. That is their plan. Alex, I got a big job for you. Stay here and protect the car. - I could do that. - Protect the car? Come on. Just because I'm a kid doesn't mean I'm stupid. - I know. - Dad! If you see anyone come running out screaming, it's just me. Maybe you should stay here and watch him. Now you're talking. - You want the shotgun? - No, I prefer the Thompson. If I were to say to you, I'm a stranger travelling from the east... seeking that which is lost... Then I would reply that I am a stranger travelling from the west. - It is I whom you seek. - Then it is true. - You have the sacred mark. - What, that? That got slapped on me in an orphanage in Cairo. That mark means you're a protector of man... a warrior for God, a Medjai. Sorry. You've got the wrong guy. Mr. Hafez. They found him. Imhotep. Do not be frightened. I am not afraid. You know... a couple of years ago, this would've seemed really strange to me. Lord Imhotep will be much pleased. Where is it? Where is the bracelet? I think I know. At the very top of the gold pyramid, there was a huge diamond. How huge? It was so big, it would reflect the sun... and wink at distant travellers... beckoning them to their deaths. Get off! Get off! Oh, my God. You wait! I'll put you in your grave again. Our thinking was, not if we put you in your grave first. Burn her! You bast... - Open it! Open it! - I'm trying! - Hurry up! - Come on, come on! - You broke it! - Be quiet! If there's gonna be any hysterics, they'll come from me! Go, go, go! Oh, no. Not these guys again. What are we gonna do? You're asking me? I'm only eight years old! Honey, what you doin'? These guys don't use doors. Where the hell's Jonathan? - Alex! - What's the matter with my car? I was forced to find an alternative means of transportation. - A double-decker bus? - It was his idea. - Was not! - Was too! - Just go! - It was too! No, not my car! Oh, I hate mummies. - Glad to see me now? - Just like old times, huh? Turn, turn! No! Get out of the way! Look out! Great driving, Uncle Jon. Yeah. You all right? This was my first bus ride. - What would I do without you? - Are all librarians this much trouble? Jeez, get a room. Let me go! Silence! Stop! Please do not fear for your son, my friends. They cannot hurt him, for he wears the bracelet of Anubis. Alex is wearing the bracelet? When he put it on, he said he saw the pyramids at Giza, the temple at Karnak. At Karnak, the bracelet will show him the next step of the journey. If we don't get to Karnak before them, we won't know where to look for him. Seems to me... like we need a magic carpet. When Lord Imhotep last encountered the O'Connells... they sent his immortal soul to the Underworld. As powerful as he will become, he is still vulnerable. Only with the Army of Anubis will he be invincible. He will need your help. Keep this with you always. The Book of the Dead! What a bright little child. Your mother must be missing you terribly. If you wish to see her again, you'd better behave. Lady, I don't behave for my parents. What makes you think I'm going to do it for you? Silence! Because your parents wouldn't slip poisonous snakes into your bed... while you were sleeping. Lord Imhotep wishes to meet the boy. Now we shall see how brave you are. Hey, watch the suit. Ow! Me fingers. Nice. Very nice. Did you acquire what we asked? We acquired it, all right. You know what? We had to kill two of those guards at the mausoleum to acquire it. This chest is cursed. It says there is one... the undead... who will kill all those who open this chest. Yes, and the creature will suck them dry then become whole again. We've all heard this story before. Yeah, but I heard the Yanks who found it nine years ago all died. Horrible deaths, they were. - So with that in mind... - We want ten. Quiet! The agreement was for five. Well, we want ten or we'll take it elsewhere. - If you... - Ten will be just fine. Follow me, gentlemen. Get in. It is you who are the chosen one... you who will take me to Ahm Shere. What if I don't? What if I get a little lost? You have strength, little one. You are your father's son, but I know something you don't. This bracelet is a gift... and a curse. The sands of time... have already begun to pour against you. Yeah, I already heard this part. From the minute I put the bracelet on... seven days do I have before the Scorpion King wakes up. Did you also hear that if you do not enter the pyramid... before the sun strikes it on that very morning... that the bracelet will suck the life out of you? That part I missed. Hey, wait a minute. That means I've only got five days left. Then I believe it will be best if we do not get lost, don't you? My dad is going to kick your ass. I do not think so. In here, gentlemen, you shall receive your just rewards. No tricks now, woman. We're not givin' up this chest till we're satisfied. Don't worry. There is much satisfaction to be had. What's going on? This place is cursed. - What is it with you and curses? - He ain't happy without a good curse. ""This is cursed. That is cursed."" Give it a rest, will ya? Christ! He wants you to open the chest. Open the chest! Where'd he go? Where'd he go? - This is the magic carpet? - It'll be fine. He's a professional. Izzy! He definitely remembers you. He's a little shy. Jonathan, get our bags. - Oh, my hands are full. - Now. - Right. I'll get the bags. - I'll deal with the flight details. - Honey, you're not a subtle man. - We don't have time for subtle. Izzy, come here. - Doesn't look happy to see you. - Never turned me down yet. Whatever it is, whatever you need, I don't care. Forget it, O'Connell. Every time I hook up with you, I get shot. Last time I got shot in the ass. I'm in mourning for my ass. - Remember that bank job in Marrakesh? - Bank job? - It's not like it sounds. - It's exactly how it sounds. I'm flying high, hiding in the sun. The white boy here flags me down, so I fly in low for the pick-up. The next thing you know, I get shot. I'm lying in the middle of the road with my spleen hanging out... and I see him waltzing up with some belly dancer girl. Belly dancer girl? - Izzy, I think you and I should talk. - As long as I don't get shot. Quit your whining. You're gonna get paid this time. Have you looked around here any? What do I need money for? What the hell am I gonna spend it on? I'm gonna keep this short. My little boy's out there. I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get him back. If you give me that gold stick, you can shave my head... wax my legs and use me for a surfboard. Didn't we do that in Tripoli? Say, by the way, when did you lose your eye? I didn't. I just thought it made me look more dashing. Come on. Get to work. - You're not catching me at my best. - Oh, I'm sure I am. I knew it. I'm gonna get shot. These are the commanders of the 12 tribes of the Medjai. Horus. Pet bird. My best and most clever friend. He will let the commanders know of our progress so that they may follow. If the Army of Anubis arises... they will do all they can to stop it. - Are you sure Izzy is reliable? - Yeah, he's reliable-ish. - Isn't she beautiful? - It's a balloon. It's a dirigible. - Where's your airplane? - Airplanes are a thing of the past. - Izzy, you were right. - I was? Yeah, you're gonna get shot. She's faster than she looks. And she's real quiet. Perfect for sneaking up on people, which is a very good thing. Unless, of course, we go with your approach... barging in face first, guns blazing, gettin' your friends shot in the ass. Why can't you people ever keep your feet on the ground? O'Connell does not want to believe, but he flies like Horus to his destiny. Yes, very interesting. Tell me more about this gold pyramid. It is written that since the time of the Scorpion King... no man who has laid eyes upon it has ever returned to tell the tale. Where is all this stuff written? Hello! Got it. Pretty nice, eh? This is all I have left in the world. The rest of my fortune was lost... to some rather unscrupulous characters, actually. If the curator reacted the way you say, it must be very important. If I were you, I would keep it close. My friend, the gods couldn't take this away from me. - That's mine. - No, it's not! Keep your hands off it. I want him back, Rick. I want him in my arms. I know. We taught him well. He's smarter than you. He's tougher than me. - I love him so much, I just can't... - I know. We both do. Alex knows that. I'll get him back, Evy. I promise. I know you will. - Are we there yet? - No. That was amazing. Perfect aim. What are you talking about? I missed. I have to go to the bathroom. Make it quick. Hurry up. - Hey, reading material! - Now! I can't go when someone's watching. I don't trust you. You'll look. Darn! Oh, my God! Doesn't anyone around here know how to flush a toilet? Karnak. If a man does not embrace his past, he has no future. Look... even if I was some sort of sacred Medjai... what good does that do me now? It is the missing piece of your heart. If you embrace it and accept it, you can do anything. Sounds great. Listen, what can we expect from our old friend Imhotep? His powers are returning quickly. When he reaches Ahm Shere, even the Scorpion King won't be able to stop him. Evy, I know you haven't been yourself lately with these dreams and visions... No, they're memories from my previous life. Honestly, I'm not losing my mind. It all makes perfect sense now. - That's why we found the bracelet? - Exactly. - I was its protector. - Now do you believe, my friend? Clearly, you were destined to protect this woman. Right. She's a reincarnated princess, and I'm a warrior for God. Your son leads the way to Ahm Shere. Three sides of the pyramid. This was all preordained thousands of years ago. And how does the story end? Only the journey's written, not the destination. Convenient. How else do you explain Evy's visions? That it is your son who wears the bracelet? - How do you explain your mark? - Coincidence. My friend, there is a fine line between coincidence and fate. Don't even think about it. Hold on there, partner. When the time comes... I shall truly enjoy killing you. But until that time... you'd better be a little nicer to me. Now, where's my water? No ice? Make sure he doesn't move! They've gone. We've lost them. Alex left us his tie... and he made us a little sand castle. It's the Temple Island of Philae. - They've gone to Philae. - Attaboy, Alex. Come on! The great temple of Abu Simbel. That's the Blue Nile down there. We must be out of Egypt by now. In ancient times, all this still belonged to the upper kingdom. The oasis must be around here somewhere. Don't worry. We'll find him. He's a smart kid. He'll leave us a sign. Surprised to see me? Leaving bread crumbs, huh? We're in trouble! Horus, fly! Izzy, come hard right! Starboard! Starboard! Was there a little something you forgot to mention? People? Ahm Shere. Right. He's back! Hang on! Well, that's not good. Hang on! Mom? Dad? We're gonna go get my son. Then we're gonna want to get out of here fast, so make this work, Izzy. You don't understand. This thing was filled with gas. Not hot air, gas. I need gas to get this thing in the air. Where am I gonna get gas around here? Bananas? Mangoes? Tarzan's ass? Maybe I could finagle it to take hot air. But do you know how many cubic meters I'd need? It's too big! If anybody can fill this thing up with hot air, Izzy, it's you. Come to Daddy. So, Rick, what's the plan? Let's find some higher ground. - I must go. - Where? To tell the commanders where we are. - If the Army of Anubis arises... - I need you to help me find my son. Then first I shall help you. Thank you. Look. Roman legionnaires. And here, turn-of-the-century French. Napoleon's troops. What in the name of Anubis did this? - You hear that? - What? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. My word! I say, chaps, look at this. Shrunken heads. I'd love to know how they do that. Just curious. You any good with that? Three times Fox and Hound's grand champion. You any good with that? You'll know soon enough... because the only way to kill an Anubis warrior is by taking off its head. I'll remember that. Try to remember to... just keep it tight in the shoulder and... lead the target a little bit, and then... squeeze the trigger... don't pull it. I won't miss. Pyramid. Cripes, I'm in trouble now. Now may I kill him? - Retrieve that bracelet. - With pleasure. Something is coming. That's my husband and my son down there. Make me proud. Today's that day, Evy. Where's the boy? The Black Book! Let's go! There you are! The time has come, my little friend. Let go! - Dad! - Alex! Time to remove that bracelet, my good son. Behind you! - Let's go. - Thank God for that. The two of you must sacrifice yourselves for me. You shall be rewarded in heaven! Nice shootin', Tex. - What were those creepy pygmy things? - Just the local natives. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. It was nothing. Come on, Mom. Come on, Dad. We have to get to the pyramid. I have to get the bracelet off now! Leave it on. Looks good on you. No, you guys, you don't understand. It'll kill me if I don't get inside the pyramid before the sun hits it... today! Oh, my God. Time to go! I thought you said it was nothing! Where's Jonathan? Look! There's a burial ground! We're safe! We're safe! They'll never cross those sacred stones! - You are sure? - Yes, of course I'm sure. Sorry. My mistake. - Wait for me! - Hurry up, Jonathan! Wait for me! - What's that for? - Just something in case of an emergency. Let's go, Alex. Run! Come on, Alex, faster! Dad! The bracelet! Come on! Come on! You know... it's not easy being a dad. Yeah, but you do it really good. Thanks. They made it. Thank God. Yes. Great. Fabulous. - She's going to be all right, isn't she? - She'll be fine. Take him. Mommy's fine. It's okay. Your mother's going to be fine. Okay? You're real strong. You're gonna make it. You're fine. What do I do? Take care of Alex. Sweetheart, no. I love you. Come back, Evy. Come back. Stay here. Try to think of it like this, Alex. She's gone to a better place. - Like it says in the good book. - The book! - What? - That's it. - That's it! - That's what? Come on, Uncle Jon! That's it! The book! You're too late, O'Connell. I have released the Army of Anubis. Lord Imhotep shall soon kill the Scorpion King... and take command. Not after I get through with him. You realize, of course, that this can only be done... by someone who can actually read ancient Egyptian. I don't know about you, but I'm a tad rusty. - Now where? - We go right. How do you know? Basically, ""This way to the Scorpion King."" Mum taught me. This just might work. It's time someone taught you a lesson, wench. Come on. This is for my sister. Is that all you've got? Hurry up, Alex! Uncle Jon, I don't know what this last symbol is! What's it look like? It's a bird. A stork! I know that one! I know that one! Then what is it? That's it! Why don't you pick on somebody your own size? Oh, my God. - Evy! - Take Alex. Go and help Rick. - But, Mom... - No ""buts."" Come on. I'll be just fine. - We did it, Uncle Jon! - Right, partner. Now let's go help your dad. That's a little something new. My lord! Save me! Save me! Okay, now I'm a believer. It's a spear! The golden stick thing! It's a spear! Really? Doesn't look like a spear! That's because it opens up into one! Yes? And? It opens up into a spear! - Twist it! - Push! You have to pull! Jonathan, quick! Throw it! Kill the Scorpion King! Send his army back to the Underworld! Step aside, Alex. I'm a professional. Go to hell, and take your friends with you! Get out of here! Just get out of here! Hang on, Rick! Let's go up! This whole damn place is gonna get sucked up! Let's move up! Go! Go, Alex! Rick, we're trapped! Get your butts moving! Hurry up! I haven't got all day! You're next! Go! Jonathan! Hold on! - Pull him up! - Pull me up! Wait! Wait! Let me down! Let me down! - It's not worth your life, you idiot! - Yes, it is! Yes, it is! Right. Pull me up! Pull me up! - O'Connell, you almost got me killed! - At least you didn't get shot. Thank you! Thank you! O'Connell, who the hell have you been messing with this time, huh? You know, the usual. Mummies, pygmies... big bugs. I thought I almost lost you there. For a moment there, you did. Would you like to know what heaven looks like? Later. - Oh, please! - Oh, please! - That's half mine, you know. - What? - That's half mine. - What are you talking about? You took my gold stick! I swear on the head of my wife, I have no idea what you're talking about. You ain't got a wife! I don't have your gold stick either!, Peter. You could not watch even one hour with me? Master, what has happened to you? Should I call the others, Lord? No, John. I don't want them to see me like this. Are you in danger? Should we flee, Master? Stay here. Watch... ...pray. What is wrong with him? He seems afraid. He had spoken about danger while we ate... He mentioned betrayal and... Thirty. Thirty, Judas. That was the agreement between me... and you? Yes. Where? Where is he? Hear me, Father. Rise up, defend me. Save me from the traps they set for me. Do you really believe... ...that one man can bear... ...the full burden of sin? Shelter me, O Lord. I trust in You. In You I take refuge. No one man can carry this burden... ...I tell you. It is far too heavy. Saving their souls is too costly. No one. Ever. No. Never. Father, you can do all things. If it is possible, let this chalice pass from me... But let Your will be done... ...not mine. Who is your father? Who are you? Who are you looking for? We're looking for Jesus of Nazareth. I am he. Hail, Rabbi! Judas... ...you betray the Son of Man with a kiss? Peter! Put it down! Those who live by the sword shall die by the sword. Put it down. Malchus! Get up! We've got him. Let's go! What, Mary? What is it? Listen... ""Why is this night different from every other night?"" ""Because once we were slaves... ""...and we are slaves no longer..."" They've seized him! Everyone you can, hear? To the courtyard of the High Priest. Quick! Go! Halt! Not so fast. This is not your party, you toothless vermin. Peter... Hey! What's going on here? In there! Stop them! They've arrested him! In secret! In the night! To hide their crime from you! Stop them! What are you yelling about, woman? Who have they arrested? Jesus. Jesus of Nazareth! Shut up! She's crazy. A criminal. Brought in for questioning, that's all. Broke the temple laws. I see. Better go tell him there's more trouble brewing. Tell who? Abenader, you idiot. Get going! Go! Jesus... Are you hungry? Yes, I am. This is certainly a tall table! Who is it for? A rich man. Does he like to eat standing up? No. He prefers to eat like... so. Tall table, tall chairs! Well, I haven't made them yet. This will never catch on! Oh, no you don't! Take off that dirty apron before you come in. And wash your hands. It has begun, Lord. So be it. Sir, there's trouble at... What, in the middle of the night, Abenader? I'm sorry. What's the problem? Trouble within the walls. Caiphas had some prophet arrested. Who? Some Galilean. The Pharisees apparently hate the man. A Galilean? Who are you talking about? Who is this beggar you bring to us... ...chained up like a condemned man? He's Jesus, the Nazarene troublemaker. You're Jesus of Nazareth? They say you're a king. Where is this kingdom of yours? What line of kings do you descend from? Speak up! You're just the son of some obscure carpenter, no? Some say you're Elijah. But he was carried off to heaven in a chariot! Why don't you say something? You've been brought here as a blasphemer! What do you say to that? Defend yourself. I have spoken openly to everyone. I've taught... ...in the temple where we all gather. Ask those who have heard what I have to say. Is that how you address the high priest? With arrogance? If I have spoken evil... ...tell me what evil I have said. But if not, why do you hit me? Yes, we'll listen to those who heard your blasphemies. Good! Let's hear them. He cures the sick by magic! With the help of devils! I've seen it. He casts out devils, with the help of devils. He calls himself the king of the Jews! No, he calls himself the son of God! He said he would destroy the temple... ...and rebuild it in three days! Worse! He claims he's the bread of life! And if we don't eat his flesh or drink his blood... ...we won't inherit eternal life. Silence! You're all under this man's spell. Either offer proof of his wrongdoing... ...or be quiet! This entire proceeding is an outrage. All I've heard from these witnesses is mindless contradiction! Who called this meeting anyway? And at this hour of the night? Where are the other members of the council? Get him out of here! Get out! A travesty! That's what this is, a beastly travesty! Haven't you anything to say? No answer to these accusations? I ask you now... ...Jesus of Nazareth... Tell us, are you the Messiah? The son of the living God? I AM... ...and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of power... ...and coming on the clouds of heaven. Blasphemy! You heard him. There's no need for witnesses! Your verdict. What is your verdict? Death! Haven't I seen you in the company of the Galilean? Yes! You're one of his disciples! I recognize you! Quiet! I've never met the man. I don't know him. You are Peter! One of the disciples of Jesus. I don't know the man! You are wrong! Stop! Stop! I've seen you before! Stop him! He's one of them! You're wrong, damn you! I swear I don't know the man. I've never seen him before. Wherever you go, Lord... ...I will follow. To prison, even to death. Amen, I say to you... ...before the cock crows... ...three times you will deny me. Peter? No, no... I am unworthy! I have denied him, Mother! Denied him three times. Let's go! You take care of it. Let him pass. He's harmless. Release him! Take back the silver. Here! I've sinned, betrayed innocent blood. Take back your silver. I don't want it! If you think you've betrayed innocent blood, that's your affair. Take your money and go. Now go! What's wrong? Are you all right? Look at his mouth. Hey, can we look at it? You need help? Can we help? He's bleeding! Look! Blood! Leave me alone... ...you little satans! Aha! Cursing! Are you cursed? He's cursed! Yes, a curse! It's inside him, look! Watch out, it's like burning oil from his bones! Get away from me! Leave me alone! Don't condemn this Galilean. He's holy. You will only bring trouble on yourself. Do you want to know my idea of trouble, Claudia? This stinking outpost, that filthy rabble out there. Do you always punish your prisoners before they're judged? Governor... What accusations do you bring against this man? Well... If he weren't a malefactor, we wouldn't have brought him before you. That's not what I asked. Why don't you judge him according to your own laws? Consul, you know it's unlawful for us... ...to condemn any man to death. To death? What has this man done to merit such a penalty? He has violated our Sabbath, Consul. Go on... He has seduced the people... ...taught foul, disgusting doctrines. Isn't he the prophet you welcomed into Jerusalem only five days ago? And now you want him dead? Can any of you explain this madness to me? Your Excellency, please... So far the high priest hasn't told you this man's greatest crime. He has become the leader of a large and dangerous sect... ...who hail him as the Son of David! He claims that he is the Messiah... ...the king promised to the Jews. He has forbidden his followers to pay tribute to the emperor, Consul! Bring him here! Go! Drink. Are you the king of the Jews? Does this question come from you? Or do you ask me this because others have told you that is what I am? Why would I ask you that? Am I a Jew? Your high priests, your own people delivered you up to me. They want me to have you executed. Why? What have you done? Are you a king? My kingdom is not of this world. If it were... ...do you think my followers would have let them hand me over? Then you are a king? That is why I was born. To give testimony to the truth. All men who hear the truth hear my voice. Truth! What is truth? I have questioned this prisoner, and I find no cause in him. This man is a Galilean, is he not? He is. Then he is King Herod's subject. Let Herod judge him. Governor... Hand him over. Jesus of Nazareth! Where? Where is he? This... ...is Jesus of Nazareth? Is it true that you restore sight to the blind? Raise men from the dead? Where do you get your power? Are you the one whose birth was foretold? Answer me! Are you a king? How about me? Will you work a little miracle for me? Take this stupid fool out of my sight. He's not guilty of a crime, he's just crazy. Give him a fool's homage... What is truth, Claudia? Do you hear it, recognize it when it is spoken? Yes, I do. Don't you? How? Can you tell me? If you will not hear the truth, no one can tell you. Truth... Do you want to know what my truth is, Claudia? I've been putting down rebellions in this rotten outpost for eleven years. If I don't condemn this man... ...I know Caiphas will start a rebellion. If I do condemn him, then his followers may. Either way, there will be bloodshed. Caesar has warned me, Claudia. Warned me twice. He swore that the next time the blood would be mine. That is my truth! Herod refuses to condemn the man. They're bringing him back here. We're going to need reinforcements. I don't want to cause an uprising. There is already an uprising. King Herod found no cause in this man. Neither do I. Men! Attend to the crowd! Quiet! Have you no respect for our Roman procurator? As you know, every year I release a criminal back to you. We are now holding a notorious murderer... ...Barabbas. Which of the two men would you have me release to you? The murderer Barabbas? Or Jesus, called the Messiah? He is not the Messiah! He is an imposter! A blasphemer! Free Barabbas! Again I ask you: Which of these two men should I release to you? Free Barabbas! Free him. What would you have me do with Jesus the Nazarene? Have him crucified! No! I will chastise him... ...but then I will set him free. See to it that the punishment is severe, Abenader. But don't let them kill the man. My heart is ready, Father... ...my heart is ready. My son... ...when, where, how... ...will you choose to be delivered of this? If the world hates you... ...remember that it has hated me first. Remember also that no servant is greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you. You must not be afraid. The Helper will come... ...who reveals the truth about God... ...and who comes from the Father. Stop! Enough! Your orders were to punish this man... ...not to scourge him to death! Take him away. Get going! Get him out of here! Your majesty... Take care of it. A beautiful rose bush. Look at him... king of the worms! Hail, wormy king! A color fit for a king! We're here to pay our respects. A leader for our brotherhood! Behold the man. Crucify him! Isn't this enough? Look at him! Crucify him! Shall I crucify your king? We have no king but Caesar! Speak to me. I have the power to crucify you, or else to set you free. You have no power over me... ...except what is given you from above. Therefore, it is he who delivered me to you... ...who has the greater sin. If you free him, Governor... ...you are no friend of Caesar's. You must crucify him! It is you who want to crucify him, not I. Look you to it. I am innocent of this man's blood. Abenader... Do as they wish. I am your servant, Father. Your servant, and the son of Your handmaid. Why do you embrace your cross, fool? All right, your highness, let's move! Help me get near him. This way. This way, Mother. Mother... Mother... I'm here... I'm here... See, mother, I make all things new. Who is that? Who? She's the Galilean's mother. Let's go. Come on! Don't fret, my daughter. Don't fret. Are you blind? Can't you see, he can't go on? Help him! You! Yes, you! Get over here! What do you want from me? This criminal can't carry his cross by himself anymore. You will help him! Now get going! I can't do that. It's none of my business. Get someone else! Help him! He is a holy man. Do as I tell you. Now move! Let's go! All right, but remember... ...I'm an innocent man, forced to carry the cross of a condemned man. Stay here. Wait for me. Permit me, my Lord. Who do you think you are? Get away from here. Impossible people! Someone stop this! Stop! Stop! Leave him alone! If you don't stop, I won't carry that cross one more step. I don't care what you do to me! All right, all right, let's get moving. We don't have all day. Let's go! Let's go... ...Jew! Almost there. We're nearly there. Almost done. You have heard it said... ...you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say to you... ...Iove your enemies and pray for those who persecute you... For if you love only those who love you... ...what reward is there in that? I am the good shepherd. I lay down my life for my sheep. No one takes my life from me... ...but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down... ...and power to take it up again. This command is from my Father. Get away now, you're free to go. Go on! Go on! You can get up now! Get up, your majesty. Can't you get up? We haven't got all day. Come on, move! We're ready. Get up, your highness. You are my friends. There is no greater love than for a man to lay down his life for his friends. I cannot be with you much longer, my friends. You cannot go where I am going. My commandment to you after I am gone is this... Love one another. As I have loved you... ...so love one another. You believe in me. You know that I am the Way... ...the Truth, and the Life. And no one comes to the Father but by me. Further out... Idiots! Let me show you how to do it. Like this! There! No, get in there. Hold the hand open like this. Father, forgive them... Father... ...Father my Father... my God... They don't know... they don't know... Stupid mongrels! Turn the wood over on its face, idiots! Take this and eat. This is my body which is given up for you. Take this and drink. This is my blood of the new covenant... ...which is given for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me. If you are the son of God, why don't you save yourself? Prove to us... ...you are who you say you are. You said you could destroy the temple... ...and rebuild it in three days... ...and yet you cannot come down from that cross. If he is the Messiah... ...I say let him come down from the cross... ...so that we may see and believe. Father, forgive them... ...they know not what they do. Listen... ...he prays for you. We deserve this, Gesmas... ...but he does not. I have sinned... ...and my punishment is just. You would be justified in condemning me. I ask only that you remember me, Lord... ...when you enter your kingdom. Amen, I tell you... ...on this day you shall be with me... ...in paradise. I thirst. Flesh of my flesh... ...heart of my heart... My son, let me die with you. Woman... ...behold your son. Son, behold... ...your mother. There is no one left. No one, Jesus! My God... ...why have you forsaken me? It is accomplished. Father, into your hands... ...I commend... my spirit. Cassius! Hurry! He's dead! Make sure!, You must do something. Baby's coming. Yeah, I know. Miss, you have to stay calm and take deep breaths. Myra. I need a doctor here now. - I'm working on it. - You're not doctor? - I'm a nurse. - You are man and you are nurse? What kind of man is nurse? Look, folks. I'm a professional, OK? I know what I'm doing. Trust me, everything's going to be fine. Yeah. Yeah, you're fully dilated. Hey. I need that doctor right now. There are no free doctors. You'll have to deliver the baby. I can see a head. Holy shit. Check it out. We did it. We had a boy. A boy. You're my hero. - I name a baby for you. - You don't have to do that. I must. It's a Latvian tradition. We will name the baby... You've reached the Fockers. We're not around, so leave a message. Goodbye. Roz. How the hell do you shut this thing off? I have no idea. Just press a button. I'm pretty sure it's off. Honey, you want a chimichanga? - They give you gas. - A little, but it's worth it. For you. I'm the one that gets the fumes. - I'm in the mood for a chimichanga. - So make a... Hey, guys, it's me. Dad, I told you six months ago to change that message. I'm calling to double check, cos I didn't hear from you. Pam and I are flying out to Oyster Bay today, then to Miami tomorrow with the Byrneses. We get in at 7.30. That should put us at the house around 9.00. So give me a call back on my cell. I want to go over a few things with you about Pam's dad and some other stuff for the weekend. Love you. Bye. - Hey. - Morning. How was your shift? - Guess what. - What? - I delivered my first baby. - No way. - Honey, I'm so proud of you. - It was incredible. I mean, just to be pulling this life force out of this woman's... You know. It was just so... The whole baby thing is... - It's so cool. - That's great, honey. - That's great. - So, you ready to go? - I want to get to the airport. - In a sec. - Things always go wrong. - We have four hours. I wish we could set a wedding date without our parents meeting. This weekend is going to be fine. - Your parents are great. - They're great in small doses. 48 hours in Coconut Grove is a small dose. Besides, you've won over my dad. And that is the hard part. It is true. I am still in the Byrnes family Circle of Trust. You're firmly in the Circle. Finally. - Taxi. - Taxi. - You going to the airport? - Yeah. - Take mine. - All right. Great. - Nice guy, huh? - Yeah. You two, you're up. - Oh, dear. - What? Well, they overbooked coach. So what does that mean? Do we miss our flight, or... Well, we are gonna have to upgrade you to first class. Really? Thank you. Sir, why don't you let me take that for you? OK. Yeah. You wanna check it? Or put it on another flight? That's cool. Just gonna store it in the captain's closet. - That was nice. - Yeah. - Champagne? - Thank you. - Champagne, sir? - Thank you. Enjoy. Would you like to purchase rental insurance, Mr Focker? No. - Thanks. - No? It's a scam. That's how they make all their money. That's true. You don't need it. Get outta here. The house of Byrnes. A lot of good memories here. Mom? Dad? I am watching you. Almost. But you have to do it with two fingers, one on each eye, like this. I am watching you. We'll get back to that later. Guess who's here? It's Professor Einstein. Hi, Little Jack. You are a genius. I see a Nobel Prize in your future. Yes, I do. Study break, boys. Company's here. - Pamcake. - Flapjack. Short stack, short stack, coming up. Put some syrup in the cup. That's how it goes, right? That's OK, Greg. - Nice to see you. - Yes. - Nice to see you, Grandpa. - Yeah. My goodness. How did my nephew get so big? Look at you. - You look just like your mommy. - He does, doesn't he? Hey, this is Greg. Remember we talked about him? Sorry, Greg. The card only comes in one gender. Yeah, no, that's all right. He's taking you in. He has a very keen sense for people, Greg. A chip off the old block, huh? Might have another CIA man on our hands. I'd be discreet about my profession if I were you. As far as your parents are concerned, I'm a horticulturalist. Are Deb and Bob house-sitting while we're in Florida? No, they're in Thailand, visiting the clinic they opened on their honeymoon. What is all this stuff, anyway? After Denny was sent away to military school, your father turned this into a learning laboratory for you-know-who. Can't you talk yet, Mr Munchkin Head, you little... Greg, Greg, don't infantilise him. Talk to him like an adult. Muskrat. - Muskrat, Jack. - Right. Try to understand, he's a little person. His communication skills aren't verbal yet, but he understands. Observe. LJ, are you hungry? Look at that. ""I would like to eat more, please."" ""I'd like a nap, and then later I'll enjoy a nice poop."" I've heard about this baby signing stuff. This is, like, cutting edge. Like... yeah. At his age, Greg, his mind is like a sponge. But when he reaches your age, his mind will be less capable of absorbing information. He's so cute. Can I hold him? I don't think that's such a good idea, Greg. Muskrat. All right. All right. This is Greg. Greg will not drop you. OK? OK. - Be careful. - Hello. Hello. I think he likes me. No? - Shit. - Focker. He's absorbing you. I don't want his first word to be a profanity. It's OK. Cover your nose. You're terrifying him. - I'll get a towel. - Focker. Cool how your dad's so into being a grandparent. I think it freaks my mom out. He spends every last second with that kid. Oh, my God. Daddy? Daddy, what is this thing? A custom-designed motor coach. Jack calls it the ""Highlight of our Twilight"". - This is incredible. - Isn't it? It's like a tank. In these uncertain times, I opted for a Kevlar-reinforced hull with two-inch thick Plexiglas windows, like on the Russian Widowmaker submarines. I want you to conduct a field test for us, Greg. I want you to demonstrate the impregnable outer skin of the coach. Throw it at the window. Jack. I'm not gonna throw a brick at your window. - It's a simple demonstration. - No. - Throw the brick, Greg. - OK. Just... - All your might. - All right. Don't worry. Your rental insurance will take care of it. Jack? Come on. We'll call a tow truck from the road. - The road? - Yeah, we're driving this to Miami. I thought we were flying tomorrow. No. Airline travel being what it is these days, so unreliable, I'll feel more comfortable knowing I have my own Posturepedic bed, my own thermostat, my own lavatory facility. So we're all gonna be in this together? We hit the road in exactly seven minutes, 27 seconds. This way we'll get in early, spend an extra half-day with your parents. - Isn't that great? - That is great. ...but I'm the one that gets the fumes. - I'm in the mood for a chimichanga. - So make a... Hey, guys, it's me. I'm getting worried that I haven't heard back from you. There's been a little change of plans. We're coming down in Jack's RV. We'll be arriving tomorrow afternoon, not tomorrow night. OK, tomorrow afternoon. And they're bringing their little grandson. So... He's a baby, so... I don't know. Welcome aboard, me hearties. This is incredible. - It's as big as our apartment. - Pretty neat, huh? Mr Jinx finally learned how to flush the toilet, huh? Yeah, Jack installed a special flusher and he learned in about two days. Hey there, Jinxy. How are you doing? Ready to hit the road, Co-Captain? - I'm the co-captain? - Let's set sail, sailor. Good afternoon. This is Captain Jack Byrnes speaking. - Daddy. - A quick announcement. As a courtesy to fellow passengers, the on-board lavatory should be used for number one only. Should a need for number two arise, we'll stop at a rest stop or a heavily wooded area. Thank you. Welcome aboard. I like that thing. You mind if I make a little announcement? Well, only the captain gets to make an announcement. Do you want to honk the horn? Sure. Only the captain gets to honk the horn. Look. Hey, Jinxy. See that? LJ, are you hungry, do you want some milk? Hey, Jack. - She wants you to honk the horn. - Not interested. Rules of the road. She honks, you honk. Come on, Jack. Give her a honk. There you go. Yeah. Hey. Looks like a team or something. ""Honk if you're horny."" Thanks for that, Greg. I'm the one that gets the fumes. - I'm in the mood for a chimichanga. - So make a... Hey, there. No hard feelings, all right? Friends? What's that? What are you saying? Wait a minute. What does this mean? I know what this means. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Poop. You gotta poop? OK. Good. Thank you for warning me. Everybody poops. Sometimes it hurts. It's OK. Just let it... Let it come out. - What did you do? - Nothing. I think he has to poop. That's not the sign for poop. It's the sign for milk. - This is the poop sign. - What's the sign for sour milk? This tastes a little funky. Because that's from Debbie's left breast. She pumped for a week to give us enough for the trip. - OK, snack pack for Little Jack. - What are you doing there? During the breast-feeding stage, Greg, infants can get confused when separated from their mothers. So I invented something to ease LJ's anxiety during chow time. I call it the Manary Gland. I had it made from an exact cast of Debbie's left bosom. Oh, yeah. OK. It's been so effective, I'm thinking of getting it patented. - Would you like to touch it? - I wouldn't. - Feel how soft it is. - I can see how soft it is from here. - No, feel it, Greg. - It looks... Yeah. Just feel the breast, Greg. - Just... - Watch the nipple. Just around here. The nipple is his. Oh, yeah. It's got a great, lifelike kinda... Or what I would imagine Debbie's breast might feel like. Not that I would know. Greg? What? You promised you wouldn't take the boob out in front of company. Nothing to be ashamed of. Breast-feeding is natural. Dad, that's not natural, that's just weird. As soon as Little Jack's topped off, we're gonna hit the road. Oh, Jack. You can't drive any more. Dr Monroe said no aggravating your sciatica. We're on a precise schedule. We bunk here tonight, we hit horrendous traffic in the morning. - Greg? - Yeah? Maybe you can drive the night shift. I could do that. I am the co-captain. So I think that falls under my responsibilities, right? - Keep her at 55. Stay alert. - Yeah. I want to get behind the wheel of this big boy. You got it. Pass. Sorry. Gotta go 55. Captain Jack's orders. - Would you like some company? - Yeah, sure. You can't sleep? Have a seat. - How about a cappuccino? - You don't have to do that. - It's no problem for me. - Really? Yeah? OK. Dina. Wake up and make Greg a cappuccino. Shake a leg, woman. Jesus. You know what, I'm not that tired. Really. It's... Relax, Greg. This cockpit's completely soundproof. You should have seen the look on your face. OK. You got me. That was a good one. Yes, it was. Yes. That's funny. But you should never talk to a woman like that. It's disrespectful. - Right. Of course. Yeah. - Greg. A man reaches an age when he realizes what's truly important. And you know what that is? Love and friendship? Enjoying the moment? Living, just... Love. - His legacy. - That too. Right. Yeah, sure. Now, my grandson, Little Jack, is part of that legacy. In six months, you and Pam are gonna be married. Then you'll want to start your own family. Actually, on that subject... - I've thought about the wedding date. - We'll discuss that later. Let's get back on point. Let me put it very simply. If your family circle does indeed join my family circle, they'll form a chain. I can't have a chink in my chain. Yeah. OK. I get the metaphor. Now, I've never met your parents, so I won't jump to hasty conclusions. But like studying a frozen caveman, if I see where you came from, I'll have a better idea of where you're going. OK. Are you thinking, maybe my parents might be a chink in the chain? A doctor and a lawyer. What's there to worry about? It seems very nice. Is that your father? That is my father. Gaylord. What the heck is that contraption? - I thought you were flying in tonight. - I left you a message. - I didn't get a message. - I left five messages. Will you get over here and plant one on me? I've been waiting so long to see my best buddy. - Good to see you. - Come here. Come here. - I missed your smell. - All right. Is this not the most handsome young man you've ever seen? I used to call him a young Jewish Marlon Brando. Can you believe I conceived him with one testicle? No, really. It's true. I only have one because the other one never dropped. It's not uncommon. But look at him. Imagine what he would have looked like if I had two. That's a good icebreaker. There's the sexiest second-grade teacher I've ever seen. That was a good one. Gets her every time. Goose bumps. She loves it. I'm Dina Byrnes. It's so nice to meet you. The pleasure is all mine, mon cherie. - You gotta be the flower man. - Right. Jack Byrnes. Pam's father. Bernard Focker, Gaylord's father. We're all grown-ups here, and we shake hands like men. All right. We're just playing here. Give me some love. We're family now. What are you so shy about? Come here. Look at those pecs. You're harder than sheetrock. You gotta work out with weights, right? I do calisthenics and medicine-ball training and I play bi-monthly football. Oh, football. I was just practising my capoeira. - What? - What? The Brazilian martial-art of dance-fighting. He knows what that is. Yeah. You know, I've been doing it for weeks. Really into it. Keeps me level. Sometimes I get wound up so tight I could just snap. You know what I mean? What is that? Is that a baby on board? That's a baby. Yes, yes. It's all in the message. Moses. Go ahead. Say hello to your future in-laws. - He's harmless. - Oh, my. - Yeah, and fixed. Moses. - It's all right. He's... - Just shake him off. - No. He likes the shaking. Get off. Don't worry. The pink part didn't get on you. - Get in your basket. Go. - He's all talk. - Who's this? - This is our grandson, Little Jack. A widdle baby. How are you, Widdle Jack? Dad, don't infantilise him. Just talk to him like a person. What are you talking about? I'm gonna talk to him like a baby. He likes me. When Roz's dad died I said, ""Hey, we're freezing here in Detroit."" ""Let's head south and get some year-round fun in the sun."" This house is over 100 years old... Continue the tour. I'll tell Mom we're here. The upstairs bathroom is on el fritzo so we'll all share this one. And there's a water scarcity on the island, so we abide by the ""If it's yellow, let it mellow, if it's brown, flush it down"" policy. Forgot my own rule. The RV's paying for itself already. All right, kids. Forward. And backward. Rotate those hips. Let's get your kundalini rising. It's time for the ladies to get into the reverse cowgirl position. Guys, lie across the Liberator pad like so. Everyone look at how Ira's doing it. The man is loose, he's limber and ready for action. Climb aboard, girls, and let me hear your bodies talk. Yes. This position is terrific for anyone with osteoporosis, gout or goitre. Stay with me. We're almost done. Honey. All right, guys. We have to wrap it up. Take your Liberator pads, and don't forget to stretch before you try this at home. We don't want anyone shattering a pelvis. Hello, my precious. I love you so much. I haven't seen my bubeleh in months. You feel thin. You're not eating. What's the matter? I'm fine. How will we explain these people? They're leaving. The Byrneses won't know they were here. You agreed to be discreet about being a sex therapist until you know Jack and Dina better. I'll be discreet. I put all my toys away. - My office is all ready for them. - Your office? No. - They're going upstairs. - They'll be comfortable. The plumbing, you don't wanna know. Talk about something important. How are things with you and Pam? - They're great. - They're great? You have to work to keep things going. Does she still climax regularly? Mom, you can't talk that way this weekend, OK? Honey, I didn't raise you to be a so-so lover. - What is he doing? - What? Don't worry about that. Mom, you've got to get these people out of here. Wipe that little gloss off you. OK. - They converted it. - You hunt deer? No, I hate that thing. Roz's father gave it to us. He was into all that macho-wacho crap. So is Greg. He and I went duck hunting together. - Duck hunting. Me and you. - Duck hunting. Yeah. What? Gay? You went duck hunting with Jack? Yeah. We went on a little hunting trip. - You shot a duck. - I shot at a duck. You killed an innocent creature of the sky? Did I? I think I might have clipped it or... Never really checked. Oh, Lord. And now for the pice de rsistance... - My goodness. - Something I'm working on. I see. Mom'll be in in a sec. What's that? It's you. It's the Wall of Gaylord. The Wall of Gaylord? Isn't it nice to finally display your accomplishments? Look at all your awards. That's great. He's my champion. I didn't know they made ninth place ribbons. They got 'em all the way up to tenth place. Anybody want to get a drink out by the lagoon? This one looks impressive. ""Mazel tov, Gaylord M Focker: World's Greatest Nurse."" Very nice. We have tried to instil a sense of self in Gaylord - without being too goal-oriented. - Be nice. It's not about winning or losing. It's about passion. We just wanted him to love what he's doing. Know what I mean? Not really, Bernard. I think a competitive drive is the essential key that makes America the only remaining superpower today. Well, whatever works. - Don't forget the positions. - Bye. You're a lifesaver. Thank you, BJ. Goodbye, Sidelle. Ira, easy on the thrusting. You're not 78 any more. What kind of work does your mother do with those patients? Those look like yoga mats. Is there yoga involved? It's yoga-esque. It's sort of a couples therapy. Kind of mind/body. It's kind of her own sort of... Rozala. Sweetheart. Living room. Hello. Hello, hello. How are you, baby girl? Oh, my God. - Look at you, you're glowing. - Thank you. Hi. I'm Roz Focker. You must be Jack. - And you must be Dina. - Hi. I can't believe it's taken us this long to meet. - And who's this little hairball? - Their grandson, Baby Jack. He's so adorable. I could eat him up. Bern, did you show them where they're sleeping? Right. We don't have air-conditioning, so I made a nice spot for you in Roz's office cos it gets a breeze and it's near the communal commode. Actually, we're gonna stay in our motor home. In the trailer? Come on, Jack. We're family. We sleep under the same roof. Mom's office is cluttered, so that works out. It's really easier with Little Jack. No, really, we insist. If they want to sleep in a trailer, let them. Mom, it's not a trailer. It's like a hotel on wheels. - It's incredible. - This is practically a hotel. I'd do a turndown service with chocolates under the pillow. Wherever you feel comfortable. - It's not right. - Let it go. - Let it go? Fine. - Yeah, let it go. Are you sulking? Look at this. I married a teenager. Right? At least you have the libido of a teenager. - I gave her a little matinee today. - Don't you dare. Stop it. How about a double feature? Come on. The lagoon. Why don't we show them the lagoon? - The lagoon. Come see the lagoon. - Jack, come on, come on. We'll get drunk. We'll take a piss in the lagoon. Roz, take them outside and show them around. I'll make the drinks. Oh, God. - Hey, Dad. - It's going good, right? You gotta take down that weird shrine. I'm very proud of you. What's wrong with showing it? It's ridiculous. Most people aren't proud of sixth place. Since when do you care about most people? I don't. But Jack is really into winning and competition and sports. - It's a whole other thing with him. - You're a winner up here and in here. That's all that matters. OK. Thank you. I don't know what that means, but thank you. To solve that problem I created a lifelike latex left breast moulded from his mother's left breast, so this way LJ will avoid any nipple confusion. You're avoiding confusion by strapping a boob on a man? Believe it or not, it is less confusing because of the texture of the breast itself. I guess it's very creative. It's very creative. A little birdie told me that one of our guests here is a Tom Collins man. For pity's sake. Isn't that nice, Jack? That is nice. Thank you. Don't drink. I wanna make a toast. Now. I had a vasectomy in 1974. - '73, honey. - You're right. '73. So I never had a chance to procreate a daughter. But had I been able to, I really would have wanted a girl as sensitive and as intelligent and as beautiful as this young lady - sitting right here before us. - Thank you, Bernie. - And she's not an accident... - Greg. - Yeah? - I thought you had a sister. Nope. No sister. You said you had a sister. You said you milked your sister's cat. OK, I'm not done yet. What I'm trying to say is, it's taken far too long to do this. You know. But we're finally all together. That's nice, honey. Oh, thank you. All right. That's enough. - L'Chaim, everyone. - L'Chaim. Like you have popcorn stuck in the throat. - OK. To family. - Family. I forgot. I want to say one more thing about my vasectomy. Sit down. Honey, get yourself over here. - I went overboard? - A little bit, honey. But you're so cute they'd forgive you anything. God, you're so beautiful. You are the sexiest woman alive. You're just trying to get me back into bed. Or the hammock. This is a delicious Tom Collins. I use real lemon juice. It's from our trees. That's the secret. He was squeezing all afternoon. Yeah. And, Jack, I managed to make some lemon juice, too. - Gay. Are you all right? - Are you OK, honey? I think that Roz and Bernie seem like very nice people. Very nice. A little off-colour, but very nice. But isn't it wonderful? After all this, the kids are finally getting married. - I feel so happy. - Wait, I think he just spoke. Little Jack. Were you about to speak? No. Just a little flatulence. What were you saying? Nothing, dear. - Guys. - What? - Where are you going? - Checking out Jack's macho trailer. - I want to see that boob. - Could I talk to you for a second? Don't let Moses go in there. They have a cat. Moses is perfectly trained. What boob? - He humps everything. - He's like his father. - I never cheated on you. - They're not listening to me. - What's up? - They're getting along really well. Yeah, they are. I feel bad that I worried so much. Yeah. It's OK. What's going on? - I'm pregnant. - You're pregnant? I'm two weeks late, nauseous, my boobs hurt and I can smell everything. - You're gonna have a baby. - A baby, yeah. - We're gonna have a little baby. - A baby. I'm pregnant. Yeah. Oh, shit. You realize your father's going to kill me. No. He's not gonna find out, because we're not gonna tell him. No. Come on. He's a human lie detector. - He lives to sniff out stuff like this. - We'll get through tomorrow and we'll tell them on Sunday before we go. I just hate keeping secrets from your dad. It's just one little secret. Oh, hi, neighbours. - Hello. - The Fockers, honey. - Fancy-schmancy. - Welcome to the chateau. No wonder they don't want to sleep in our shitbox. I don't think the dog is a good idea. Moses is more of a lover than a fighter. - Jinx. - Moses. He's always dreamed of me having a white wedding. He'll be upset. I know. Moses. - Jinxy. - Moses. I told you to keep him out of the RV. - He wanted to see it. - Dad. Moses. Moses. Get that goddamn dog out of here. Mo... - Oh, God. - Dad. - Whoa. - Jinx. - Jinx, don't do it. - Jinxy, no. No. Jesus. Moses. Hold on. Moses, hold on, I'll save you. The cat can flush? Oh, my God. - It's OK. - Get out of the way. - That's my toilet. - I have to get my dog. What about my toilet? Moses. Greg, grab the baby. He's alive. He's fine. So much for the protection of our rolling safe house. Oh, honey, he was trying to save his pet. I mean, what if it was Jinxy who got flushed into a toilet? Mr Jinx has had aquatic training. He would have known exactly what to do. 20-minute warning for dinner, guys. Sorry about the trailer, Jack. Muskrat. It's OK, Bernard. - We're not telling your father. - That's what I was saying. - What do you want to do? - I'm not sure. I thought we'd be married before we got pregnant. - Hey. - What? What if we move the wedding up to next month? Then we tell your dad you got pregnant on the honeymoon. Oh, my God. Yeah, that could work. - It's perfect, right? - Yeah. - OK, good, just follow my lead. - OK. Without further ado, my famous Focker fondue. Go on. Dig in. Get it while it's hot. That is so impressive, Bernie. Did you do that yourself? Sure. I love to cook. I can't even fry an egg. I burn cornflakes. I'm amazed he finds time to cook with such a high-powered career. High-powered? I wouldn't exactly call it... - Why did you kick me? - I kicked you because you're being modest and you should tell people that you are a good lawyer. He's fought some big, important legal battles. When Gay was born, I stopped practising and became a stay-at-home dad. Believe me, he won a trial or two in his day. - Extremely good trial lawyer. - A regular Clarence Darrow. So Roz was the breadwinner and you didn't have a job. - Dad... - Honey. Come on. You could say he had the hardest job. - He's just kidding. - Of course. I'm... Yes. Why don't we jump into the big Focker-Byrnes wedding? Yes. Good. I know we've mentioned a fall wedding... Isabel? - Is that Isabel? - Yes. Our former housekeeper. She has her own catering business now. I asked her to come and help Bernie in the kitchen. - You didn't say she was here. - Gay had a monster crush on her. - Really? - I didn't have a monster crush... - You didn't tell me. - It's not true. Not true that I didn't catch you doing a ba-ziga to her passport photo? - Honey, stop. - I walk in the door... Where is he? There's my baby. It's good to see you. - I haven't seen you in years. - I know. Yes. You... Yeah, look at you. You look... I know. I had a boob job. Yeah. Hey. This is Dina and Jack Byrnes. Hi, Isabel. And this is Pam Byrnes, my fiance. Nice to meet you too. Not yet married and already a little one? He is a handsome little Focker. - No, he's not a Focker. - No, he's not mine. You stayed to raise her child? Good for you. He's Pam's nephew. He has no connection to Greg whatsoever. I love you, too. He wants some milk. Little Jack, no. Those aren't for you. - Mom. - I think I'll take him inside. Good idea. You are a very lucky woman, Pam. He is very special, this one. - I think so too. - I could tell you some stories. - Really? - She's just being silly. - It was nice to meet you all. - Nice to meet you. So sweet. Gosh. So sweet. Do you guys want some more wine? You did good. - She's very pretty, this one. - Yeah, she's really great. Can you believe it's been 15 years? So many wonderful memories from those days. Yes. Yes. A lot of wonderful, kind of private, memories. So you never told your fiance about us? No, I don't think I did. It never really came up. Not that I didn't want her to know, it just never really... Not that it wasn't great. It was really... For me, it... And you were so helpful. Don't worry, your secret's safe with me. OK. There's no secrets. But good. Yeah, maybe keep it quiet this weekend. I don't want Pam to feel uncomfortable. And then later, when it's the proper setting... OK. Yeah. Good. Good. And the fondue. It's going over. Gay, you're just in time to hear me tell how you lost your virginity to Isabel. He was 19. A late bloomer. You slept with Isabel? We were relieved. - Why would you bring that up? - What? It was 15 years ago. Your father thought it would be fun to share stories about our first time. - Really? That sounds like fun. - It's fine. Tell how you poppity-popped your cherry. I don't feel comfortable discussing that with you. Let's get back to talking about the wedding. - Yeah. - Thank you. What... Didn't you just take Little Jack back to the room? I'm monitoring him from a microphone planted in his crib. Baby monitors, hidden cameras. Whatever happened to privacy? Surveillance technology protects the freedoms we Americans take advantage of today. He's right. It has been good. Son, that is bullcrap in a chef's salad. Jack, tell me one smart thing the CLIA has done, I will give you the deed to her house. The CLIA? The Central Lack of Intelligence Agency. That baby might need a pull on that knocker of yours, Jack. It's OK. We're Ferberizing him. - What? - The Ferber method. You let him cry it out so he doesn't depend on coddling. And yet, the Continuum Concept shows that a baby benefits more from constant physical contact. - We use the Ferber method. - We used the Focker method. We hugged and kissed our little prince like there was no tomorrow. We Fockerised him. That's right. Greggy slept in our bed till he was ten. - Oh, my God. - It wasn't quite that long. - Yes, it was. - I wasn't ten. - Nine and a half at least. - Mom, I don't think so. I didn't sleep in their bed till I was ten. - Get the photo album. - I'm one step ahead of you. No, we're eating dinner. Come on. These are the curls from his first trip to the barber shop. Nobody wants to see this. - Show Jack. - Look at all those little teeth. Isn't that sweet? Somebody looks very grumpy there. - That's Gay with the mohel. - The mohel? He's the man who snips the baby's little winky-dink. That's Greg getting circumcised, right here. The ceremony was at my parents'. There was a cold snap... Tell it. The heater conked out so no matter how he tried, the mohel couldn't coax Greggy's tiny turtle from its shell. Let's not talk about the tiny turtle, OK? This is dinner. Honey, half the people at this table have penises. - Mom, control yourself. - Roz, he's right. - You're embarrassing him. - I'm sorry. To make a long story short, he wound up with a semi-circ. - What's that? - I can't wait to hear this. - A cross between an anteater... - And a German army helmet. But, honey, you wanted to talk about the wedding, right? Don't tell me you kept his umbilical cord. Of course not. That's Greg's foreskin. That's it. That's enough. - Come on. We're having fun. - We're not having fun. - Why deny us our memories? - Because we're done. Anyone in the mood for a Chinese? You told me your first time was with a Danish transfer student. You weren't upfront about your engagement to Kevin. - Well, he wasn't my baby-sitter. - OK, I should have told you. Can we just let it go, please? We've both got enough stuff to deal with this weekend. - Oh. Hi, Jack. - Hello, Greg. - Funny dinner, huh? - How do you mean? You're studying my family like the frozen caveman. So I just don't want you to be worried, OK? They're a little quirky but they're really well-intentioned. - I think they were just nervous. - Greg. Tomorrow will be better. Sorry, ma'am. I thought you ordered room service. Are you sure you don't want any whipped cream with your sundae? - Bern, stop it. - Who's Bern? - I'm Chad the bellhop. - Oh, no. We did that last week. Be Sam the carpet-cleaning man. Why would a carpet cleaner have whipped cream? Improvise, honey. Evening, Miss, I'm here to clean your carpet. Do you mind if I put some foam down on your rug? I don't mind at all. - Good night, Greg. - Sleep well. How long have you worked at this hotel? It's time to put some snow on your mountains. Get some whipped cream on those Tetons. - Guys. - Come back in the morning. Gay, see the cowboy hat on the door? Hat is off the door. No cowboy hat this weekend. I'm coming in, so stop doing what you're doing. Look, I was talking to... Oh, no. You know what that cowboy hat means. - Please help me out here. - What? We're just being ourselves. - Mom, please... - He's saying not to be. Be yourselves, but be yourselves in a way that's a little less than being your full selves. I don't understand this. Why are you so afraid of Jack? You've kissed his ass since you got here. I'm not afraid. That's not true. - It is. - You went duck hunting with him. Our people don't shoot ducks. Just make Jack feel more comfortable. You don't want us to be ourselves. I don't want you to break his RV and say I had sex with Isabel and play weird sex games that everybody can hear. Mom. If you ask me, it wouldn't be so bad if your future in-laws heard this. Don't therapise the Byrneses this weekend. At all. OK? A few minutes of concentrated work with him and Dina, she'd get him to blow like Krakatoa. Right. OK. Yeah. You know what? Just give me one day without any complications. We get through it, everybody goes off, we go on with our lives. - Can we do that? - You got it, dude. - Thank you. - Hon? - Put the hat back on the door. - No. - No cowboy hat this weekend. - But tonight doesn't count. - All aboard. - My God, that tickles. Morning, partner. - Morning. - Sleep OK? I slept all right, thank you. It's nice all of us being here together, don't you think? Bernard, do you mind if I have some privacy? Almost done. Bernie, this frittata is wonderful. What's in it? A lot of the taste comes from this skillet. I never wash it. Hey, guys, can I have everybody's attention, please? Gay, I'll be back in a sec. OK. Dad? All right. - So... Mom? - Yeah. I know we've been talking about having the wedding in October, but Pam and I have been playing around with some ideas and we're thinking of moving it up to June. - Nice. - This June? - Yeah. - Yeah. That's... That's in a month. I always wanted a spring wedding. We can announce it at the party tonight. - Good idea. - Wait. What party? Jack, let's play football. Your father and I are throwing an engagement soire for you two lovebirds. Would you look at that punim? That's so sweet. Thank you, guys. I thought we were having a quiet dinner? - It was supposed to be a surprise. - The list keeps growing. Now it's up to 50 Fockers. When were you going to tell us about this? 50 Fockers. What could be better? What are you doing? We never play football. Trying to cement relationships. Jack said he was into footie-ball. Let's show El Stiffo how we play the game. - ""Footie-ball""? - Come on. Come on, let's play. I'm feeling tired. I'll sit this out with Little Jack. - You want company? - No, Dina. You and I will take on Jack and Roz. Come on, Jack. It'll be fun. We'll swap wives. Don't worry. You'll get him back after the game. We'll play three on two with somebody as quarterback. - Gay goes both ways. - Oh, I bet he does. One. Two. - Huddle up. - I want it down and in. Draw in the defence, then you'll hit Roz here for a TD. What do you mean? He hits me where with a what? Why? I'll throw it, you catch. - You want me to catch that thing? - Yeah. On two. Ready? One. Two. Go, Mom, go. - This way. - That way. That way. It's over. It's over. Your ass is mine. Remember that time in the park? Remember the park? Guys, come on, cut it out. - I'm so proud of you. - I caught the ball, honey. - Mom, come on. - I caught the ball. - Huddle up. - I'm bored. Here. Dina, come on. Let's go. - You want a spritzer? - What? Oh, a spritzer. Yummy. Dad, you've got to focus. He's beating you down the field. - You want me to be macho-wacho? - What? Have I ever said ""macho-wacho"" to you? I got it. Gay, I won't disappoint you. OK, let's try again. I want to stop and go. Fake the short pass and hit me with a Hail Mary. Got that? Yeah. Do you want to mix it up a little, or... No. I've exposed Bernie's weakness. I want to take advantage of it. Exposed his weakness? OK. All right. On four? Four. Just you and me, Jack. Mano a mano. Think you can take me, Flower Man? Pretty sure I can, Mr Mom. You're going down, Byrnesy boy. I'm gonna rearrange your bouquet. Sell the pump-fake, Greg. That Focker's gonna bite. One. Two. Three. Four. - Oh, God. - Daddy, are you OK? Shit. Jack, don't move. - Hey, Jack, are you OK? - I'm fine, Greg. Thank you. I see that kind of injury all the time. Let me give you a quick exam. No, I'm fine. I'll have my doctor look at it at home. OK. It's amazing how your father anticipated the pump-fake. It's almost like he knew it was coming. Well, he definitely takes competition seriously. How a man handles himself on the field says a lot about his character. - Know what I mean? - Yeah. OK. - Hey. - Hey, we got him, didn't we, dude? - Was he impressed? - No, Dad. He wasn't. That was a hard shot, you could have hurt him. I just wanted it to be fun, but you wanted to win so, you know, you got me all steamed up. I asked you to play a little defence, not turn it into a blood sport. I play too easy. I play too hard. - What are you asking me to do? - I'm not asking anything of you, Dad. Just go down there and apologize. He thinks it was a cheap shot. - Sure. OK. Whatever you say. - OK. - I can't win with this kid. - Honey, it's OK. - Hi, baby. - Hey. So... - How far along is Pam? - What? Come on, I knew it the minute I saw her. Her boobs are bigger, she's hormonal, no wine at dinner, no football. She just found out yesterday. Honey. My bubeleh's gonna have a baby. My bubeleh's gonna be a father. Oh, my God. Tell me. Talk to me. This is so exciting. What? - You didn't tell Dad? - Not yet. He's gonna plotz. - You can't tell him. - Why not? Because he can't keep a secret. Do you think Jack knows? That guy is in such denial, he thinks his daughter's still a virgin. Pam doesn't want to tell him till after the wedding. - That is ridiculous. - It isn't. - You don't know him. - Fine. My lips are sealed. I am so excited and thrilled for you. I'm so happy for you two. - Did you plan this? - No, it just sorta happened. - How did it happen? - How? It just happened. You know how it happens. I mean, I'm not gonna go into details. - But, honey, I love details. - Sorry. All right. OK. You know, honey, many unplanned pregnancies happen because the man is such a sexual dynamo and the woman craves his sperm on an unconscious but very powerful level. I'm not comfortable having this conversation. - No? - I've said that since I was 11. - All right. Love you. - Love you, too. Jack, what say you and me go into town? - I got a guy who can fix your RV. - I'm in far too much physical agony. I'm sorry. But it'll be good for you to get out and about. Perfect. I can take the girls shopping in Coconut Grove. Little Jack is on a specific napping schedule. - I'd better stay here. - No. Go. Greg can watch him. He has wonderful parental instincts. Greg deals with little kids in the E.R. All the time. They don't call me Barry Poppins for nothing. That's funny. Why would someone call you Barry Poppins? They wouldn't. Remember, Greg, we're Ferberizing him, so unless it's an emergency, under no circumstances should you pick him up when he cries. - OK. - He's learning to self-soothe. That means no television, no unapproved toys, and most of all, no monkey business of any kind. Clear? No monkey business. - Jack. Shall we get a move on? - I'm ready. I love this, Roz. This is a great find. Oh, good. It's loose, so you can wear it even if you gain a few pounds. Isn't that lovely? Honey, are you all right? You look a little flushed. It's the heat. It takes some getting used to. I'm fine, I'm gonna try this on. Thank you, Roz. And now, madam. Let's find something sexy for the mama to wear. Look at this little number. I think this'll get Jack's blood flowing. Jack would have a coronary. I thought so. Oh, Dina. Talk to me. What's really going on with that man? He seems very uptight. Jack's always been a little wound up. His job was very stressful. Being a florist is stressful? There's more to it than people think. If you don't mind me asking... How's your sex life? I can't tell you that. What's the big deal? I'm a professional. I'm a sex therapist specializing in senior sexuality. I knew those weren't yoga mats. No. Well, we're not 25 anymore. You're not dead, either. Many couples our age lack intimacy in marriage. I didn't say we weren't intimate. There are special occasions. Anniversaries and... Well, on our anniversary. - I beg your pardon? - Not good. I think that I can help you and Jack reconnect. How? Well, it all starts with a little bit of, how shall I say, intimate contact. Yeah? Oh, my. That tingles. Every pleasure in the body can be stimulated through the ears. I would give it a shot with Jack tonight. - What's going on over here? - Nothing. Just having some girl talk. Roz. OK. Here's the deal, LJ. I'll give you some attention. But you have to promise you don't tell Grandpa Jack anything, OK? All right. Good. OK, I don't know what that means, but I'll trust you. All right. Here we go. OK. OK. It's OK. A little huggy-wuggy never hurt anybody. I know we're not supposed to watch TV, but we won't tell Grandpa Jack. Oh, look. Look. It's Elmo. Do you like fishes? You don't like fishes? No. OK. OK. Hey. I got an idea. Let's see what pre-approved genius toys Grandpa Jack has in his big basket of fun. Oh, look. Look. It's a... It's a... an abacus. Abacuses aren't that much fun, are they? I don't know why people think they are. Look at this. Look. It's bolts on a plank. Fun bolts. No, not very fun. Hey. A little birdie. Look. He sings. And if that mocking bird don't sing Then Greg is gonna buy you a diamond ring And if that diamond ring gets sold Greg's gonna feel like a big asshole Ass... hole. No, no, you don't want to say that word. No, that's a bad word. - Ass... hole. - No, no. - I thought this was a repair shop. - This is better. That's Isabel's son, Jorge. 15 years old. He can fix anything. Hey, Bernie. Georgie-boy. So, I think you got a tear in the bilateral valve. - 15, huh? - Genius. Jorge, no more tinkering until you finish your science homework. I was gonna finish it, but Mr Gerson is out with rickets. He said definitely don't do it until his rickets are cured, and... Who knows if he's ever telling the truth? Bernie? I made chimichangas. You guys want? Have you ever known me to turn down a chimi? - Jack, you in the mood, amigo? - No, thanks. Why are you looking at me funny? I said I... No, you just look like somebody I know. No, no, no. Tadpole. Tadpole. - Can you say tadpole? - Ass... hole. Jack's mole. Jack has a big mole on his face. - Is your father a mechanic? - I don't know. I never met him. Never met your dad? Well, that's unfortunate. But very interesting. Mind if I take a picture of you? - You know, just for fun. - OK. Mr Moose likes to say good words He doesn't like you to say bad words Ass... hole. OK, just hang on a sec there. Ass... hole. - Yeah, hello? - Hi, it's me. How's it going? Horribly. He's crying and screaming and cursing. That poor kid is desperate for human contact. Hold him and kiss him. Do whatever it takes. I've been hugging him in secret. Feeding him chocolates, too. ...and told Elmo all about it. All animals have babies. Say hello to my little friend. He's probably teething, so put a dab of rum in his milk. It'll ease the pain and he'll go to sleep. - Give him a drink? - Less than a thimbleful. You don't want Jack coming home to a screaming baby. Listen to your mother. Goodbye. I love you. All right. Mom? OK, Little Jack, I got a surprise for you. Little Jack? Mr Moose is looking for you. Oh, shit. Where the hell did he go? LJ? Little Jack. LJ. Little Jack. Where are you? Does that Jorge resemble anyone you know? No one I know. There's something you don't see every day. Focker. Focker. OK, I know this looks bad, but I can explain. What happened? I said no monkey business. - There was no monkey business. - You're wearing my breast. Little Jack is drinking. Moses is sodomizing Jinxy. No monkey business? What is going on here? - We're home. - Hey, guys. Give me the bottle. - What happened to Little Jack? - His hands are stuck. - Thanks. - You bet they're stuck. Greg, how did this happen? And why are you wearing antlers? - It's very complicated. - It's just glue. He's fine. He's not. If he had the use of his hands, he'd say so. - All right. - Honey, are you OK? - Greg... - Dina? Pam? Yes, Dad. Coming. Little Jack? Honey, I said a thimble, not a bottle. - Oh, Greg. - Hey. - How's the little guy doing? - Everything's just as good as new. - Yeah? - Dad, come on. - Is he all right? - He's asleep. I don't care if they called you Larry Poppins. You can't handle a child. - It was Barry Poppins. - What cocktail were you making? He's teething. I told Greg to give him rum to ease the pain. - It was your idea? - Yes. - What is wrong with you people? - I used to rub bourbon on Denny's gums. Look what happened to him. You couldn't follow simple instructions? He was screaming so I gave him a little attention, OK? These setbacks are disastrous for his development. Don't exaggerate. The child is adorable, but he's not Little Buddha. What are you saying? I've seen that kid eat at least 15 boogers since he's been here. I've got news for you. Prodigies don't eat their own boogers. And prodigies don't come in tenth place. OK, Dad, that's my fianc. I have never seen people celebrate such mediocrity. Why? Because we love our son? We hug our son? The truth is, you are so concerned about that Little Jack but I think it's the Little Jack in you who's crying out for a hug. The Little Jack in me? You have issues. You run around with a rubber boob strapped to your chest. - Were you breast-fed? - Mom, stop. - Key question. - I guess not. Spare the drugstore psychology. - It all comes down to that. - Everybody, all right, just... Everybody just stop. OK? Jack, yes, Little Jack wouldn't stop crying so I gave him some hugs and I let him watch TV. I answered the phone, I came back in, he'd let himself out of the playpen, put on Scarface and glued his hands to the rum bottle. OK? - That's it. - Oh. That's it. Greg just said that's it, so I feel better. That's it. OK, let it go. He's fine, Greg. He's asleep. He spoke. Ass... hole. - What? - I dunno. Come on. Did he say what I thought he said? Little Jack, what did you just say? Ass... hole. His first word? It just slipped out of my mouth. He... - He has a mind like a sponge. - Enough. I'm calling a family conference. Great idea. Let's finally get your problems out on the table. With my own family. Excuse us. I'd like to talk to Pam and Dina in private. Of course. Of course. Take your time. Come on, honey. Come on. I'm not sure this wedding is a good idea, to say the least. I don't like what I see of these Fockers. What? Has Greg mentioned a Jorge to you? I don't know what you're talking about. No, why? I think your fianc may have skeletons in his closet he's not telling you about. Skeletons don't like living in closets. God, here we go again. Dad, listen. - Greg has no skeletons, OK? - Oh, really? - No. - You know that? - Yes. - I see. - She knows. - I'm not a child. This wedding is happening. The sooner you accept it, the better for all of us. - I can't talk to you. - Wait a second, sweetheart. I'm not so sure Roz is a yoga instructor either. Jack, you promised you would behave yourself. What you said to them was really hurtful. I think you should go up there and apologise. I'm not going to apologise to them. Jack. A little birdie told me that somebody's gonna be a daddy. - Mom. - Sorry, honey. Look at that face. How could I keep it a secret? He's so excited about being a grandpa. We can call me Poppity-Pop. - Pop-a-doodle-doo. - OK, OK. Look. - But no champagne, OK? - Why? Jack's angry. He's also a bit meshuggener. Come on, honey. How often do we get to be grandparents? - We are having a toast. - This is a secret. - Jack can't know till we're married. - Why? We're honest people. No. I can't stand this secrecy any more. Please, be quiet. Why diminish our joy because they live in denial? Seriously. I promised Pam, OK? She thinks it'll break his heart. - I'm not drinking. - Your father's right. This is the 21 st century. Married or not, there's no shame in fatherhood. This is the fruit of your loins. That is so beautiful. Say that to him again. - The fruit of your loins? - Yes. This is the fruit of your loins. Let's toast and make a sandwich. Mom wants to be the cheese. What are you doing? What did you do? - You OK there, Jacko? - What's the matter? What happened? I was coming to apologise and my back went into spasm. It's tender from that horrific football accident. I feel it. You're knotted like a pretzel. You must be in a lot of pain. I don't mind. I learn from pain. Pain, schmain. My fingers are magic. I'll work out the kinks. Oh, yeah, that's a lovely offer, Jack. No, thanks, I'll be fine. My wife does wonderful body work, Jack. I don't think he needs it. OK, handsome, shirt off. I'd rather have it on. Oh, no dice. No, no, no. It has to come off. Lovely. You know, most back pain is psychological. We carry our emotional baggage right here in our muscles. I've been watching you, Jack. Studying your body language. And you're a very sensual man. But I'm not sure you realize that. - What are you doing? - It's a technique I learned in Hawaii. It's a Lomi-Lomi massage. Named after the gentle waves of the Polynesian sea. The waves go in, and the waves go out. The waves go in... Hit some driftwood. Jack Byrnes, you are a caged lion. But lions can't be captives their entire lives. They have to be free to roam the bush, free and wild. Your wife is a hot, sexy tigress. She's waiting for you to pounce on her. Let me hear you roar, baby, roar. Your body is talking to me. It's hungry for action. I can feel it. - Unleash the beast inside you. - Stop it, you're hurting him. I am not hurting him, I am helping him. Just don't... You shouldn't move just yet. Jack, come back for an afternoon session. It'll do you good. - What are you doing? - We were close. - I was getting through to him. - He doesn't like to be touched. He has the emotional hide of a rhinoceros. - Don't break him down. - I was trying to do you a favour. You were riding him like Seabiscuit. Dial Foxtrot One. Alpha Foxtrot One. Foxtrot One, I need a full comparative DNA analysis on one Gaylord M Focker, one Jorge Villalobos, translation: George House of the Wolves. - Might take a few weeks, Santa. - I need a 12-hour turnaround. I'll secure physical evidence. Handoff at Harry Focker's Good Time Supper Club, 2100 hours tonight. You got it. Foxtrot One, out. - Hello. - Bernie, this is Jack Byrnes. Where are you calling from? My RV. Would you have Greg meet me here in three minutes? - Your trailer? - Thanks. Goodbye. But... Hey, Gaylord. Jack wants you to meet him in his trailer in precisely three minutes. And I have to tell you, El Stiffo is really starting to freak me out. Greg, wait, OK? No matter how hard he probes you, promise you will not break. I'm not ready to tell him I'm pregnant. - Honey. - What? Let him probe. Cos he's probing a brick wall. Now show me how you would like a romantic evening to go. Jack, wine and candles. Gosh, it's not even our anniversary. Come here, hot stuff. Yes. Yes. - Jack. - That was good, Dina. - Jack? - Down here, under the bed. Down here, Greg. Have a seat. Watch the panel. This is incredible. So this is like your mobile command centre for all your spy activities? Mainly a secure space for me to spend some alone time and reflect on my thoughts. Very cool. - Greg. - Yeah? You'll recall we had a discussion earlier in the week regarding my feelings about family, legacies, children and so forth. Yeah, of course I recall. I'm going to just ask you once. Is there anything you want to tell me regarding things that might have happened? Unplanned things. Things involving the fruit of your loins. No. Well, if he's not going to admit it on his own... - Hello. - Hello, Jorge. - It's Jack Byrnes. Remember me? - Yeah, sure. You came with Bernie. You had that camera pen. Yeah, that's right. - Do you have any plans tonight? - No. Good, cos I'd like to invite you to a party. - Hey, sweetie. - Hey. - Having a good time? - No, not really. No? Did you tell your mother I'm pregnant? She keeps touching my stomach, smiling. - Like that. - No, I didn't tell her, she guessed. - She what? - Then she told my dad. Oh, my God. Stop it, Bernie. Bernie, stop. It's not funny. - Well, I told my mom. - What? - Yeah. - What are you... I... - Your dad will find out. - No. She knows him. She won't say a word. - He's very suspicious. - Greg. - Hi. - Hi. Please take this to your mother. It's a wine spritzer. That's all she drinks now. OK. You boys have fun. Nice... Nice party. Isn't it? Yeah, it is. It's got a nice, festive vibe. You've met some of the cousins? I met some, yes, I met some... Dom. Yeah, Dom Focker, that's my dad's first cousin. Did you meet his kids, Randy and Orny? I've met Randy and Orny, yes. Come on, I want to introduce you to somebody. Come on. There he is. Glad you could make it, Jorge. Thanks for the invite, Mr B. Greg, this is Jorge Villalobos. How you doing? Isabel's son. I didn't realise Isabel had a son. - When did she get married? - She's not married. He's never met his father. I'm sorry. I mean, that's too bad. Oh, no, it's cool. My mom said my dad wasn't mature enough to deal with a kid. So, yeah. So how do you know each other? This young man is quite the mechanic. He's only 15 years old. Isn't that impressive? Really? You're 15? - Yeah. - That is impressive. - He's a handsome kid, huh? - Yeah. Almost like a young, half-Hispanic Marlon Brando. Well, I'll leave you two guys to talk. You probably have a lot in common. Well... So you're 15? Come on, you Fockers, conga. Did you order the Tom Collins, sir? Is it made with fresh lemon juice? They're Bermuda lemons, sir, and I squeezed them myself. Stay safe, Santa. Go, Bernie. Go, Focker. Go, Bernie. Go, Focker. I mean, it's romantic out here, don't you think? The moon, the sea. - Isn't it nice? - Yeah, it's nice. You look very handsome tonight, Jack. Thank you, I... What are you doing to my ears? Nothing. I was... Gay. Gay. I have to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. OK. - Hello, Greg. - Hi, Jack. Did you have a nice conversation with your son? Jack, I never even met that kid before. Focker, you've been covering this up from the beginning. No, I haven't, Jack. It's just another one of your crazy theories. Greg, you're still in the Circle of Trust, so I'm gonna give you one more chance. Are you ready to admit you've been hiding this from Pam? No, I haven't. - You're not hiding anything? - No. All right? Oh, Greg... What are you holding? What's in your hand? Nothing. I can see in the mirror. There's something in your hand. - Don't worry about it. - Is that a needle? Yes, it is. You seem tense. I was going to offer you a sedative. - You're joking, right? - No, I'm not. - Jack... - Is that tartar sauce on your shoulder? Tartar sauce? Why? You've been injected with a concentrated dose of sodium pentothal, street name ""truth serum"". You will have no recollection of this. Tonight, for the first time in your life, you are going to be honest. Keep the pressure on it. Get down, Little Jack. Get funky. - Hey there, preggers. - Quiet. - How you doing? - Where've you been? I went to the bathroom to pee, and now I am talking to you, my fiance, who I've delayed marrying for two years because I didn't want our parents to meet. What? - What? - What? You don't like me? It's OK. I don't like your little red outfit. Makes you look like a demon baby. Maybe I'll get you a pitchfork for Christmas, so we can put you on a can of Underwood ham. I'm sorry I can't make little poop sounds and I can't make little things that tell people when I want to do things. Guess what. I can make a sign to you, too. How's that for a sign? Look, Bernie's onstage. Come on. Now, to say a few words, one of the great registered nurses of all time, Gaylord Myron Focker. Come on, let's give it up to Gay. Give it up to him. Bernie Focker. I love the shirt, Dad. Thank you. All right. It's great to be here with all of you, as I am about to set sail in my ship of life with my first mate, the beautiful young blonde lass there. Hey, baby. I love you, honey. I still masturbate to Pam. - Greg. - What? It's true. Honey, what? Come on. You're hot. Look at her. Look at those boobs. Man. I just wanna lather them up with soap and just... I love it. Man, I just wanna nestle in there and take a little vacation in there. - Honey. - Honey, what? I'm sorry. OK, excuse me for you being perfect. Hey, you know who else is great? That woman over there. My future mother-in-law, Dina Byrnes. If you want to know what a woman will look like when she gets older, look at her mother. Well, I'm a-lookin' and I'm a-likin'. Look at her. Sweetness. Good genes in the Byrnes gene pool. Hey. Hey, you. Yeah, you. Hold on. Pam, I got to tell you something about this little dude. In my first really passionate sexual awakening, I did in fact lose my virginity to our beautiful housekeeper, Isabel... Greg, that was in the past. So come and sit down. No, honey, I have to get this off my chest. Sit. We conceived a child. His name is Jorge Villalobos. Come up here, Jorge. Let's lift the veil of mystery. The fruit of my loins is right here. Everybody, take a look. See his face. He is mine. Search your feelings, Jorge. You know it to be true. It's OK, I know. I know. A lot of information. You let it settle. Who'd have thunk it? Give that kid a hand. Oh, and, Jack. Pam's pregnant. Focker out. What happened last night? Well, you got drunk and told my dad I'm pregnant. You revealed you have a 15-year-old son named Jorge. And apparently, you have the hots for my mom. Oh, my God. - Is that really true? - I think she's attractive. No. That you have a son you never told me about. Honey, if it is, I never heard about it before last night. Isabel never said anything to me. I mean, I don't even remember drinking. - You're telling me the truth? - Of course I am. Pam, I love you. I'd never lie to you about anything like that. I love you, too. And if Jorge really is your son, then we will make it work. OK. How did your dad react to the pregnancy news? Well... Just as you'd expect. Slept in the RV. Hasn't spoken to anyone since last night. Pam, we have to leave. Get in the RV now. Bernard, get out from under the vehicle or I will run you over. I'm not moving. There's a nonviolent way to handle this. What's going on? Your father wants to leave, Bernie is staging a sit-in. Dad, get up. This is ridiculous. You weren't around in the '60s. This is how we got things done. Pam, Dina, we have to get off this island. It's evil. Jack Byrnes, out of the RV. You are acting like such a jerk. Yes. There you go, Jacko. Yes. Man, we're gonna have a grandchild. - We should be celebrating. - How could you not see it? Greg is completely unfit to handle a child. He's neglected his own son for 15 years. Jack, I didn't even know he existed. Who knows? You're dishonest about everything. You're so much better? Tell us all what you did last night to Greg at the party. - Muskrat, Dina. - Stuff your muskrat, Jack. He shot Greg with truth serum before his speech. - What? - I found this in his pocket. Here we go again, Dad. He did this to Pam's junior-prom date. Wait a minute. Yes. You stuck a needle in my neck. - You drugged my son? - I had no choice. - He refuses to tell the truth. - He's terrified. He thinks he has to impress you. He's had us trying to impress you, but in my opinion, it's you who should be trying to impress us. Jack. You've insulted me, my wife, my son, our entire way of life. I've sat back and taken it, but you've crossed the line, sir, and I am gonna have to kick your ass. Dad, wait a second. I'm going to teach this florist some justice, Focker-style. - Calm down. - Just give a minute to stretch. You're gonna hurt yourself. - We can talk this through. - Too late for words. Dad. No dance-fighting. Stop. This is capoeira. This is hardcore shit. Bernard, if you continue, you will force me to engage you and once I begin the secrets of combat, it will only end with your demise. Bring it, dawg. Come on, bring it. Come on. - He's taunting me. - Dad, chill out. - Greg. - What? You're gonna snap now? - Greg. - What? - Greg, honey. - Now look what you did. - It's your fault. - He's bleeding, Daddy. Pam, Dina, I'm calling a family conference. - Come on. - No, Dad, this is the family. In a few weeks I won't be Pam Byrnes. I'll be Pamela Focker. Or Byrnes-Focker. We haven't decided. No, no, no, I'm gonna be Pamela Martha Focker. I know how that sounds, but that's the name I'm taking. Pamcake, you're upset. I'm not sure you're thinking clearly. It's you who is not thinking clearly. These two kids love each other. We've been kvelling over the pregnancy all weekend. You knew she was pregnant? We all did, Jack. I was gonna tell you after the wedding. This was the reason I created the Circle of Trust, so we could discuss these things. The circle isn't gonna work if you don't trust anyone that's in it. That's right, honey. - Dad. - Jack. - Don't go. - Daddy. Daddy, please. Daddy, where are you going? - Come on. - Don't drive away. - Daddy, come back, please. - Jack. - What are you doing? - Dad. This is nisht gut. - Is it ringing? - There's no answer. Give him space. Maybe he's self-soothing. - Roz. - This is crazy. I'm going. - I'm coming with you. - I can do it myself. I know these roads like the back of my hand. Come on. Let's put this family back together. Floor it, Gay. I know a shortcut. We'll beat El Stiffo to the freeway. I think you make a right up here. Or a left. It's either one or the other. - You don't know where we are. - Something's wrong. - This makes no sense. - Dad. It's a map of Detroit. - Well, that explains it. - Dad... Punch it, Gay. We're gonna catch that dude. - Oh, shit. - Come on. Come on. Keep going. Dad, it's a cop. Listen carefully. Let me do the talking. I know how to handle local cops. - Dad, don't do any talking. - Don't shush me. I'm a lawyer. Know how many tickets I've talked myself out of? Look at this yutz. Don't they have height requirements? We're screwed. Don't. Dad. He said to remain in the vehicle. Sir, I said to remain in your vehicle. - I just wanna talk... - I gave you an order. - Let's talk like... - Fail to comply, I will arrest you. - His future father-in-law... - Shut it. ...thinks Gay has a bastard son. - I said, shut it. - Shut it. - I know my civil rights. You know your rights? - I have sensitive wrists. - Sir, return to your vehicle. - I don't know what he said... - That's it. On your belly. - My belly? - Got a hearing problem, freak? Now we got two failures to comply. Now, I need the two of you to remain on the vehicle. - OK, now, here's my plan. - Plan? Dad, no. It was just a joke. I'm sorry. I was just trying to help you, Gay. I know, Dad. You're always trying to help. What's the intel on Operation Living Skeleton? Focker's not the kid's father, Jack. Are you kidding me? I was sure I had that pegged. I'm sending you a visual uplink. The dad was a minor-league Florida ballplayer. His name is Rusty Bridges. We all make mistakes, Santa. Foxtrot One out. 34 years spent reading other people and I get it all wrong. My own wife, I don't even know what she's thinking and my daughter keeps secrets from me. Sometimes I think you're the only person I can really talk to, LJ. Ass... hole. I know. F-O-C-K... Fock-kare. Hey, it's Jack. Hey, Jack. Jack. Jack. Halt. - Jack. Jack. - Jack. Weaver stance. Oh, my God. You shot my son. Halt. Your son has merely been stunned by a less-than-lethal weapon. Remain calm. 50,000 volts of electricity are now passing into your skeletal muscle tissue. Your nervous system has been incapacitated, but you will regain motor functions momentarily. Do you mind telling me why you are arresting these men? Oh, mercy. It just gets better and better. That is none of your business, lookie-loo. - Gay? - Return to your camper. At ease. Put away the TASER. - Jack Byrnes, CIA. - Cl-what? It says here you're retired. What you gonna show me now, old timer? - Your AARP card? - You listen to me. Listen good. - What's he doing? - Don't worry. - He'll get us out of this. - You have... - Stand down, sir. - I will not. You stand down. - I will not stand down. - You will. Or you'll be working security in a retirement home. Remain calm. It's been an hour. You think they caught up with him? I'm sure, sweetheart. If I know Bernie, they're in a caf in Little Havana, eating chimichangas and working out their issues. Check it out. He's got a rubber booby. - What's going on? - I talked to Judge Goldfarb. It's done. We're out. - You were making our call. - I ran into the judge. - I took care of everything. - Yeah, right. What are you saying, Jack? If you had kept your mouth shut, we wouldn't be in this mess. I'm a lawyer. I'm trying to get us out. Give the judge your fondue recipe? I'm comfortable enough in my skin to cook for my family. When did you last give Dina breakfast in bed? When did you last give her anything in bed? - You're out of line. - You are out of line. - You are. - You hurt my feelings. There is no reason to hurt my feelings. - Stop it. - He insulted me. Yeah, well, this isn't about you, all right? Either of you. It's about me and Pam. We're getting married. That's it. We're starting our own Circle of Trust and guess what, you're not in it. You can't start a Circle of Trust. It's my circle. You don't have a patent on the circle. And you're not in your own circle right now. That is untrue. I say who's in or out of the circle. I'm confused. Whose circle am I in? Nobody's. Look, we're starting a family, OK? We're gonna have a baby. I have a 15-year-old son. You guys have gotta put aside your issues and do what's best for us, OK? - Greg, Jorge's not your son. - What? I had a comparative DNA analysis conducted and I made a mistake. You made a mistake? - Yes, I did. - Wait a minute. Truth serum, DNA matches. Who the hell are you, Jack Byrnes? I'm not really a florist, Bernard. I was in the CIA for 32 years. I retired right before I met Greg. Oh, sure. Well, that makes sense. Bernie, why the heck are you still here? - Ira. - Cletus, open up. Let these guys out. Judge, what exactly did he say to you? He didn't have to say anything. Dr Roz saved my marriage. I'd do anything for that woman. You tell Sugar Pants I'll see her in class next week. Will do, Ira. Thanks. What can I say? I'm married to a very powerful woman. - All right. Let's go. - Excuse me. - Could you close the cell door? - You wanna remain in the cell? We're not done talking yet. What? So what do you think? Can we work this out or not? OK. Jack? I don't know. Good enough. All right. I think Pam and I should get married this weekend. I'm not so sure that's a good idea. - You wanna be in the circle? - OK, this weekend. Jack. I think I can get Judge Ira to marry you guys. I don't think so, If it's all right with you, I already have a minister in mind. Oh, God, Daddy, you didn't? Meeting Greg made an impression on Kevin. He spent eight months on a kibbutz, took an internet course and got ordained as an interfaith minister. Jack told me that you were OK with me conducting the ceremony. - I hope that's true. - I think it's great you're doing it. I mean, it is a little weird. Listen to me when I say this. Pam and I did not have one-tenth of the spiritual connection you two obviously share. I look at you both together and you're beautiful. I get it. - OK? - OK. - Thank you, Kevin. - Thank you, Greg. You're gonna be a great mom, Pamcake. Thank you, Daddy. And who gives this woman to this man? I do. Jack Tiberius Byrnes. Daddy. - Sorry, Greg. - OK. She's all yours now. That was sweet, honey. You all right? - Shalom, everyone. - Shalom. Which is Hebrew for ""What's going on?"" Let us begin with the blessing of the wine. Amen. - Kevin. - What? Yeah, go ahead. Well, hi. - Rosalind. - Yeah? I just have to say, I underestimated you. When it comes to relationships, you might know what you're talking about. I appreciate that, Jack. Really, thank you. I also was curious about the advice you gave Judge Ira. Is that classified information? I thought you'd never ask. I'm gonna give you a crash course. OK? Come here. Really? And I do that for how many minutes? There's my brother from another mother. Congratulations, Jacko. We made it. Put that away, Bernard. We're family now. We're family. If you'll excuse me, I have some unfinished business to take care of. Go get her, Tiger. - We Fockerised him. - We sure did. I'd like to Fockerise you. Sweetheart, do we have to hurry like this? We're on a covert operation. The bandleader told me we have 23 minutes before they cut the cake. Jack, what are you doing? A little trick Bernie taught me. Now, let's find out, LJ, why the Ferber method isn't working. Hi, baby. Hi, Little Jack. OK. Look what I brought you. What did I bring? A chocolate for the baby. Is that good? You're not supposed to have this. Grandpa Jack doesn't like chocolate. He's wacko. Don't tell him, OK? I got cake in the refrigerator. Later I'll bring you that, OK? Chocolate cake. Good boy. But don't tell anyone, OK? OK. One more. Yell and scream all you want. Making noise is what this country's about. We got a little protestor on our hands. It figures. I should have known this was gonna go on. Always question authority. Question everything El Stiffo Grandpa Jack says. Know why? Because he's full of... He's full of... Grandpa Jack is full of... Grandpa Jack is full of... There he is. Little man Jack. How you doing? Can I interest you in a little wodka? Just kidding. I'm officially your uncle now so I was thinking I should give you some uncle-y advice. Hints for surviving in this family. You gotta learn to keep secrets from your psycho Grandpa Jack. He was upset when you got out of the playpen. We'd never tell him that instead of watching you, I was out by the lagoon, smoking a little reefer. Or that whole thing about Pam being pregnant. There's no little Focker on the way. The whole thing was made up so Jack would let us get married. You got to do what you gotta do, right? That's cute. It's like an alligator tchotchke thing. What's that in its mouth? It's got a camera. Busted. Hi, Jack. I knew you were there all along. I was just doing a little show for you. You know I don't smoke pot, or anything. And Pam is pregnant. You should have seen the look on your face. - So good. - Ass... hole. Look at me, Jack. What am I? I'm a frozen caveman. Study me, Jack. Learn how strange the Focker genetic code is. We are weird mutants who hug and kiss. We show emotion. Jack must learn from us and chip away with his hammer of truth. Focker., Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by Love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. Like that's ever going to happen. What a loony. Shrek Beware Stay out I think he's in here. All right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains. Well actually that would be a giant. Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse. They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin. They'll chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes. Actually, it's quite good on toast. Back, back beast, back! I warned you! Right. This is the part, where you run away. Yeah! And stay out. Wanted. Fairytale creatures. Right, this one is full. Take it away. Give me that. Your fine days are over. -25 pieces of silver for the witch. Next. -Come on. Sit down there! And be quiet! This cage is so small. You wouldn't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please, give me another chance. Oh, shut up! Next. What do we got? This little wooden puppet. I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy. Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. No! Please, don't let them do it! Next. What do you got? Well, I've got a talking donkey! Right. Well that's good for ten schillings, if you can prove it. Oh, go ahead fella. Well? He's just a li..., just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. You boneheaded donkey! That's it. I have heard enough. Guards! No, no, he talks, he does! I can talk. I love to talk. I've talked to... Get her out of my sight! -No, no, I swear! Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He can fly! He can talk! -That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey! You might have seen house fly, maybe even a superfly. But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly! Seize him! Get him! This way! Hurry! You there. Ogre. -I. By the order of lord Farquaad. I am authorized to place you both under arrest. And transport you to designated resettlement facility. Oh really? You and what army? Can I say something to you? Listen, you were really, really something, back there. Incredible. Are you talking to... ...me? Yes, I was talking to you. Can I just tell you that you were really great back there with those guards. They thought that was all over there. And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping on over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. Oh, that's great. Really. Man, it's good to be free. Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? But I... I don't have any friends. And I'm not going out there by myself. Hey wait a minute. I have a great idea... I'll stick with you. You and me in green fighting machine. Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us. Oh, a, that was really scary. Maybe you don't mine me saying. If that don't work, your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause... you definitively need some tic-tac or something, 'cause your breath stinks! Man you've? my note! Just like the time... ...and then I ate some rotten berries. Man I had some strong gases leaking out of my but that day. Why are you following me? I'll tell you why. 'Cause I'm all alone, there is no one here, beside me. My problems have all gone. There's no one to derive me. But you got to have free... -Stop singing! Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends. Wow! Only a true friend would be that truly honest. Listen! Little donkey. Take a look at me! What am I? A... ...really tall? No! I'm an Ogre. You know, grab your torch and pitchforks. Doesn't that bother you? Nope. Really? -Really really. Oh? Man, I like you. What's your name? A..., Shrek. Shrek?! But do you know, what I like about you, Shrek? You've got that kind of: ""I don't care what nobody thinks of me"" thing. I like that, I respect that, Shrek. You're all right. Uh, look at that. Who would wanna live in a place like that? That would be my home. Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful. You know you're quite a decorator. It's amazing what you did with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess, you don't entertain much, do you? I like my privacy. You know I do to. That's another thing, we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You try to give them a hint and they won't leave. And then there's that big occurred silence, you know? Can I stay with you? -What? Can I stay with you, please. Of course! -Really? No. -Please! I don't want to go back there. You don't how is like to be concerned like a freak. Well..., maybe you do. But that's why we have to stick together! You got to let me stay! Please! Please! OK, OK. - But one night only. - Huh, thank you! A, what are you do... No! This is going to be fun. We can stay up late, swap the manly stories. And in the morning... I'm making waffles. Where do I sleep? Outside! Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know, I don't know you and you don't know me... ...so I guess, outside is best for me. Here I go. Good night. I do like that half door. I'm a donkey all alone outside. Sit by myself outside, I guess. I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me. - I thought, I told you to stay outside. - I am outside. Well James. This is far from the farm, but what choice do we have? It's not... What a lovely bed. -Got you! I found some cheese. Awful stuff. - Is that you Gordon? - How did you know? Enough! What are you doing in my house? Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table! Where would we supposed to put her. The bed's taken. What? I live in a swamp. I've put up signs. I'm a terrifying Ogre! What do I have to do, to get a little privacy? Oh, no! No, no! What are you doing in my swamp? All right, get out of here. All of you. Move it! Come on, let's go. And hurry up, hurry up. No, no, not there. Not there! Hey don't look at me. I didn't invite them. Oh gosh, no one invited us. -What? We were forced to come here. -By who? Lord Farquaad. He? All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is? Oh I do. I know where he is. Does anyone else know where to find him? - Anyone at all? - Me. -Anyone? Oh pick me, I know! Me, me. Ok, fine. Attention all fairy tale things! Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially warned up. In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get all off my land and back where you came from. You. You're coming with me. All right. That's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a world and big city adventure. I love it. I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek! I'm on road again... What did I say about singing? - Can I whistle? - No. - Well, can I hummer? - All right. That's enough. He's ready to talk. Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. You monster. I'm not a monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairytale trash, poisoning my perfect world. - Now tell me! Where are the others? - Eat me. I've tried to be fair to you, creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! - Tell me! Or I'll... - No, no, not the buttons. Not gumdrop buttons. All right! Who's hiding them? Ok, I'll tell you. - Do you know the muffin-man? -The muffin-man? - The muffin-man. -Yes, I know the muffin-man. Who lives on Proully lane? - Well, she's married to the muffin-man. -The muffin-man! - The muffin-man! -She's married to the muffin-man. My lord! We found it. Well then, what are you waiting for? Bring it in. Magic mirror. Don't tell him anything! Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? Well, technically, you're not a king. A..., felonious. - You were saying. - What I mean is a... ...you're not a king, yet. But you can become one. All you have to do, is marry a princess. Go on. So, just sit back and relax my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are. Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shading from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for two evil sisters. Please welcome... Cinderella. Bachelorette number two is a kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy. Although she lives with seven other man, she is not easy. Just kiss hers dead frozen lips and find out what a live wife she is. Come on. Give it up for... Show-white. And last but certainly not least. Bachelorette number three is a fire-breathing?, dragon guarded castle, surrounded by a hot boiling lava. But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes Pina Coladas and getting cut in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona. So will it be, bachelorette number one? Bachelorette number two? Or bachelorette number three? - Two... - Three! -Two! One. No, no, no. Three. Pick number three my lord. Ok, ok. Number three. Lord Farquaad. You've chosen... princess Fiona. She's nice. Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone... But I probably should mention little thing that happens at night... - I'll do it! - Yes, but after sunset... Silence! I will make this princess Fiona my queen. And Duloc will finally have the perfect king! Captain! Assemble your finest man. We're going to have a tournament! That's it, that's, right there, that's Duloc. I've told you I'll find it. So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle. Aha, that's the place. Do you think maybe he's compensating for something. Hey, hey wait up Shrek! - Hey, you! - No, no! Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just... It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? Hey look at this. Wow! - Let's do that again. - No. no. All right. You're going the right way for smack bottom. Sorry about that. That champion should have the honor, no, no... ...the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely princess Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner up will take his place. And so on, and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. Applause. Let the tournament begin. What is that? Ugh, it's hideous. Oh, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. Indeed. Knights! New plan. The one, who kills the Ogre, will be named champion. How about him. Oh, hey. Now, come on. Can't we just settle this over a pint? No? All right then. Come on. Hey Shrek! Let me, let me! The chair! Give him the chair! Thank you. Thank you, very much. I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel! Shall I give the order sir? No. I have a better idea. People of Duloc. I give you our champion! What? Congratulation, Ogre. You've won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. Quest? I'm already on a quest. A quest to get my swamp back! - Your swamp? - Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairytale creatures. Indeed. All right Ogre, I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me and I'll give you your swamp back. Exactly the way it was? Down to the last slime covered toast tool. - And the squatters? - As good as gone. What kind of quest? Ok, let me get this straight! We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp, which you only don't have, 'cause he filled it with full of freaks on the first place. - Is that about right? - You know what? Maybe there is a good reason, donkeys shouldn't talk. I don't get it Shrek. Why didn't you just pull some old Ogre stuff on them? You know,?. Grab his bones to make you brave. You know the whole Ogre trick. Oh, you know what. Maybe I could have decapitated entire village and put their heads on plate. Got a knife, cut open their spleens and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you? A, no, not really, no. For your information, there is a lot more to Ogres than people think. - Example. - Example? OK, A-a-m, Ogres are like onions. - They stink? - Yes, no. - O, they make you cry. - No. Oh, you leave them out on the sun and they get all brown and start? little wild hairs? No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. O, you both have layers. You know not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes. Cakes have layers. I don't care what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes. You know what else everyone likes? Paffe. Have you ever met a person and you say: ""Hey, let's get some paffe"" and they say I don't like paffe. Paffe is delicious. No! You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden. Ogres are like onions. End of story. Bye, bye. See you lather. Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. You know I think I've preferred your humming. Do you have a tissue or something, 'cause I'm making a mess. Just the word paffe has made me start slimying Why, Shrek, did you do that? Man you got to warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was opened and everything. Believe me donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. It's brimstone. We must be getting close. Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking? brimstone. I know what I smell and? no brimstone. And they don't come of stone neither. Sure it's big enough, but look at the location. Oh, Shrek, remember when you said that Ogres have layers? Oh, yeah. Well, I have a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear? sleeves. Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. - You know what I mean. - Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs. No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava! Come on donkey, I'm right here beside you. Ok? For emotional support. We'll just hackle this thing together one little baby step after time. - Really? - Really really. Ok. That makes me feel so much better. Just keep moving and don't look down. Don't look down, don't look down. Shrek! I'm looking down! I can't do this. Just let me off right now, please. - But you're already half way. - Yeah, but I know that half is safe. Ok, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back. Shrek, no, wait. Don't do that! Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? - Oh. This? - Yes, that! Yes, yes. Do it. OK. - No, Shrek! - I'm doing it. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. That will do Donkey, that will do. Cool. So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway? Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her. I was talking about the dragon Shrek. - Are you afraid? - No, but shhhhh. Oh, good. Me neither. Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid. Here's a..., something responsible of the situation. Not to mention dangerous situation. And there's dragon that breathes fire. I'm sure he's meaner than a cow or anything, but they're scare. You know what I mean. I'm sure he's heavier than a cow... Donkey. Two things. Ok? Shut, up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs. Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess. The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower. What makes you think she'll be there? I read it in a book once. Cool. You handle the dragon, I'll handle the stairs. Oh, I'll find those stairs. I'll?. That's right. Those stairs won't know which way they go. The drafting stairs,? Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I'm master of the stairs. I wish I had a stair right here right here now, I'd step all over it. Well, at least we know where the princess is. - But where is the... - Dragon! Donkey, look out! Got you. Oh, what large teeth you have. I mean, white sparkling teeth. You probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach yourself, because that is one dashing smile you got there. And do I detect the hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure. I mean 'course you're a girl dragon, 'cause you're just ricking the feminine beauty out. What's the matter with you? Do you have something in your eye? Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know I'm a asthmatic and I don't know if we would worked out. You'd be blowing smoke and stuff. Shrek! No, Shrek! Shrek! - Wake up! - What? Are you princess Fiona? I am. Awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me. Oh, that's nice. Now let's go. But wait, sir knight. This be our first meeting. Should not be wonderful, romantic moment? Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time. Hey, what are you doing? You know, you should sweep me out of my feet. Out through the window and down the rope by to your valued steed. You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? Uh-um. But we have to sing through this moment. You can residing of a poem to me. A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti. Or something. I don't think so. Well, can I at least know a name of my champion? Shrek. So, Shrek. I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. Thanks. - You didn't slay the dragon? - It's not my job to do this. Now, come on! But this isn't right.? That's what all the other knights did. Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame. That's not the point. Wait. Where are you going? Exit is over there. Well, I have to save my ass. What kind of knight are you? One of a kind. ...rush into a physical relationship. I'm not that emotionally ready for commitment of a this magnitude. That was the word I was looking for. Magnitude. Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and take this one step at the time. I mean, we really should get to know each other first, you know what am I saying. As friends, maybe even as? Hey don't do that. That's my tail. That's ma personal tail. And you're going to tear it off... Oh, no. No! - It talks?! - Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick. Ok, you two. Head for the exit. I'll take care of the dragon. Ruuuuun! You did it. You rescued me. Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a... ...a little unorthodox I admit, but by deed is great and by heart is pure. I'm entirely in your debt. And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed. I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She thinks I'm a steed. The battle is won. You may remove your helmet good sir knight. - Aah, no. - Why not? I have helmet hair. Please. I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer. Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust. But, how will you kiss me? What? That wasn't in a job description. - Maybe it's a perk? - No. It's destiny. You must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and besieged by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight. And then they share true love's first kiss. With Shrek? You think, wait... ...you think Shrek is your true love? Well, yes. You think that Shrek is your true love. What is so funny? Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok? Of course you are. You're my rescuer. Now, now remove your helmet. Look. I really don't think this is a good idea. - Just take off the helmet. - I'm not going to. - Take it off! - No! - Now! - Ok, easy. As you command your highness. You're an Ogre. Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. Well, yes, actually. Oh no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an Ogre. Princess, I was sent to rescue you by lord Farquaad, ok? He's the one, who wants to marry you. Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me? Good question. You should ask him that, when we get there. But I have to be rescued by my true love. Not by some Ogre and his pet. Well so much for noble steed. Look princess. You're not making my job any easier. Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right? - I'm a delivery boy. - You wouldn't dare. - You coming donkey? - Put me down! Yeah, I'm right behind you. Put me down or you will suffer the consequences. This is not dignified. Put me down. Ok, here's another question. Let's say that a woman 'digged' you, but you don't really like her, that way. Now, how you let her down real easy, so her feelings aren't hurt? But you don't get burned to a crisp neither. How do you do this? Just tell her, she's not your true love. Everyone knows it what happens when you find... Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc, the better. Oh, yeah. You gonna love it there princess. It's beautiful. And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad. What's he like? Well, let me put it this way, princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. Oh no, Shrek. There are those who think little of him. Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You know, you're just jealous that you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad. Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess. But I'd like you do that measuring when you see him tomorrow Tomorrow? It will take that long? - Shouldn't we stop to make camp? - No. That would take longer. We can keep going. But there are robbers in the woods. Whoa, time out Shrek. Camp is definitely something that sounds good. Hey. Come on. I'm scarier than anything we're gonna see in this forest. I need to find somewhere to camp, now! Hey, over here. Shrek, we can do better than that. Now, I don't think this is decent for princess. No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches. Homey touches? Like what? A door. Well, gentleman I'll be d..., good night. Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story, 'cause I will... I said good night! Shrek! What are you doing? I just..., you know... Oh, come on, I was just kidding. And that one, that's Throwback. The only Ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields. Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future form these stars? Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look. There's Blodna, the ""Flatulent"" You can guess what he is famous for. All right. Now I know you're making this up. No. Look. There he is and there's the group of hunters running away from his stag. Man, there ain't nothing, but a bunch of little dots. You know donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Forget it. Hey Shrek. What are you gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway? - Our swamp? - You know. When we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff. We? Donkey, there is no we. There's no our. There's just me and my swamp. And the first thing I'm gonna do, is build a ten foot wall around my land. You cut me deep Shrek, you cut me real deep just now. You know, what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out. No, do you think? - Are you hiding something? - Never mind Donkey. Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it? No. This is one of those drop it and leave it alone things. - Why don't you want to talk about it? - Why do you want to talk about it? - Oh, Why you block? -I'm not blocking. -Oh yes you are. - Donkey, I'm warning you. - Who are you trying to keep out? Just tell me that Shrek. Who? Everyone, ok? - Oh, now we're getting somewhere. - Oh, for 'the love of pit'. Hey, what's your problem Shrek? What do you got against the whole world anyway? Look. I'm not the one with the problem, ok? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go: AAA... Help! Run! A big stupid ugly Ogre. They judge me, before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone. You know what? When we met, I didn't think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre. Yeah, I know. So, a... Are there any donkeys up there? Well, there's a Cabby. The small and annoying. Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big shining one, right there. That one, over there? That's the moon. Again. Show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess. Perfect. Yeah. You know I like like that. Oh come on baby... - Donkey. Wake up. - What? -Wake up. Morning. How do you like your eggs? - Good morning princess. - What's all this about? You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday and I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me. Thanks. Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. - Shrek! - What? It's a compliment. Better out than in I always say. But that's no way to behave in front of a princess. - Thanks. - She's as nasty as you are. You know. You're not exactly what I've expected. Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them. Princess! What are you doing? ?mon shery, for I am your saviour. And I am rescuing you from this green... beast. Hey! That's my princess. Go find your own. Please, monster. Can't you see I'm a little busy here? Look, pal. I don't know who you think you are. Oh, of course. How rude that was. Please, let me introduce myself. Oh marry men! Man, that was annoying. Oh, you little... Shall we? ?all the forin? Whoa, hold on, now. Where did that come from? - What? - That. Back there. That was amazing. Where did you learn that? Well, when one lives alone one has to learn these things in case there's a... There is an arrow in your butt. What? Oh, would you look at that. Oh, no... This is all my fault. I'm so sorry. - What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt. - Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt! - Oh, no. Shrek's going to die. - Donkey, I'm ok. You can't do this to me Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep your legs elevated. Turn your head?. - Does anyone know how to handle... - Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light! - Donkey! - Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. - What are the flowers for? - For getting rid of the Donkey. Now, you hold still and I'll yank this thing out. - Hey! Easy with the yanking. - I'm sorry, but it has to come out. No, no. It's tender. What you're doing here is the opposite... - Don't move. -Ok, look. Time out. -Would you... Ok. What do you propose we do? Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't colorblind. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming! Not good. Ok, ok, I can lose it. It's just about it. Nothing happened. We were just a... Look if you want to be alone, all you had to do is ask, ok? Oh, come on. That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just... Au! Hey, what's that? Is that... There it is, princess. - Your future awaits you. - That's Duloc? Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things lord Farquaad is compensating for something, which I think needs, he has a I guess we better move on. Sure, but Shrek... - I'm worried about Donkey. - What? I mean. Look at him. He doesn't look so good. - What are you talking about? I'm fine. - Well, that's what they always say. And the next thing you know you're on your back. - Dead! - You know she's right. You look awful. - Do you want to sit down? - You know, I'll make you up some tea. Well, I won't say nothing, but I've got this twinge in my neck. And if I turn my neck like this, look. Au, see? - He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner. - I'll get the firewood. Hey, where are you going? Oh man, I can't feel my thumbs. I don't have any thumbs! I think I need a hug. This is good. This is really good. - What is this? - Wheat rat. - Rotisserie style. - No kidding. - Oh, this is delicious. - Well, they also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean wheat rat stew. I guess I'll be dining a little different late tomorrow night. Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you. Swamp toast, soup fish, eye tartar. You name it. I'd like that. - Ah..., princess? - Yes, Shrek? I'm a... I was wondering. Are you... a... Are you gonna eat that? Man, isn't this romantic. Just look at that sunset. Sunset?! Oh, no. It's late. It's very late. - What? - Wait a minute. I see what's going on here. You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you? Yes, yes. That's it. That's, I'm terrified. You know I'll better go inside. But don't feel bad, princess. I used to be afraid of the dark too. Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark. - Good night. - Good night. Ahh. Now I really see what's going on here. Oh, what are you talking about. Hey I don't wanna even hear. Look, I'm an animal and I got instincts. And I know that you two are digging on each other. I can feel it. Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad. Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the fairemones. Just go in there and tell her how you feel. There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that... well you know. I'm not saying that I do, 'cause I don't. She's a princess and I'm... ...an Ogre. Yeah, an Ogre. - Hey, where are you going? - To get more firewood. Princess. Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you? Princess? It's very spooky in here and are we playing little games. - No, no. - Help! Shrek! Shrek! - No. -Shrek! - It's ok. It's ok. - What did you do with the princess? - Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess. - It's me, in this body. - Oh my god. You ate the princess. - Can you hear me? - Donkey! Listen, keep breathing. I'll get you out of there! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! This is me. Princess? What happened to you? You're a... different. - I'm ugly, ok? - Yeah. Was it something that you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea. - You are what you eat, I say. - No. I've been this way as long as I can remember. What do you mean? Look, I've never seen you like this before. It only happens when the sun goes down. By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm until you find true love's first kiss. Then, take love's true form... - Oh, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry. - It's the spell. When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible ugly beast. I was placed in a tower to await the day when my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the sun sets and he sees me, like this? All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24/7. But Donkey, I'm a princess. And this is not how a princess is meant to look. Princess. How about if you don't marry Farquaad? I have to. Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell. But you know, you're kind of an Ogre. And Shrek... Well you've got a lot in common. Shrek? Princess, I... How is it going first of all? Good? Good for me to. I'm ok. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty. And, well, I don't really like it, but I thought you may like it, because you're pretty. But I like you anyway. A... I'm in trouble. Ok, here we go. Who could ever love a piece so hideous and ugly? Princess and ugly don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek, but only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love. Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell. Well, at least you've got tell Shrek the truth. No, no. You can't breathe the word. No one must ever know. What's the point of being unable to talk? You got to keep secrets. Promise you won't tell. Promise! All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. You know, before this is over, I'm going to need whole lot of serious therapies. Look at my eye twitching. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. I tell him not. I tell him! Shrek! Shrek! There's something I want... Shrek. Are you all right? Perfect. Never been better. I... There's something I have to tell you. You don't have to tell me anything, princess. I heard enough last night. - You've heard what I said? - Every word. I thought you'd understand? Oh, I understand! Like you said, who could love a hideous, ugly beast! - I thought that wouldn't matter to you. - Yeah, well, it does. Ah, right on time. Princess. I brought you a little something. What I missed? What I missed? - Princess Fiona. - As promised. Now hand it over. Very well, Ogre. The deed to your swamp. Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go. Before I change my mind. Forgive me princess for startling you, but you startled me. For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before. - I am lord Farquaad. - Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for I was just saying short... farewell. Oh. That is so sweet. You don't have to raise good manners on the Ogre. - It's not like it has feelings. - No. You're right. It doesn't. Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona, I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom? Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make... Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wedd... No! I mean I... Why wait? Let's get married today. Before sunset. Oh, anxious are we? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's so much to do. There is the camera, the cake, the band, the guests... Captain! Round up some guests. Farewell Ogre. Shrek, what are you doing? You let her get away. - Yeah, so what. - Shrek. There's something about her that you don't know. - I talked to her last night. She's... - Yeah I know you talked to her last night. You're great pal, aren't you? Now, if you two are such good friend, why didn't you follow her home? - Shrek. I want to go with you. - I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone. My swamp, me and nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! - But. I thought... - Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong. Shrek. Donkey? What are you doing? I was thinking of all the people, you would recognize a wall when you see one. Well, yeah. But the wall supposed to go around my swamp. Not through it. It is around your half. See? That's your half and this is my half. Oh, your half? Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head - Back off! - No. You back off! - This is my swamp. - Our swamp. - Let go, Donkey! - You let go! - Stubborn jackass. - Smelly Ogre. Fine! Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you, yet. - Well, I'm through with you! - Well, you know. You were always me, me, me. Well, guess what? Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me, you insult me, you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away. Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back? Because that's what friend do. They forgive each other! Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey. I forgive you for stabbing me in the back! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy. You're afraid of your own feelings. - Go away. - See? There you are, doing it again. Just like you did it to Fiona. And all she ever do, was like you. Maybe even love you. Love me? She said I was ugly! A hideous creature. - I heard that you two were talking. - She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about... ...somebody else. She wasn't talking about me? Well then, who was she talking about? No way, I'm not saying anything. You won't listen to me, right? Right? - Donkey. - No! Ok, look. I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big stupid, ugly Ogre. Can you forgive me? - Hey, that's the friends are for, right? - Right. - Friends? - Friends. So? What did Fiona said about me? Why are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her. The wedding! We'll never make it in time! Never fear! For where there is a will, there is a way. And I have I way. Donkey? - I guess this is just my act of magnetism. - Oh, come here, you. All right. All right. Don't get all started. No one likes kissass. All right, hop on. Hold on tight. I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts, yet. People of Duloc. We gather here today to bear witness to reunion of our new king... Excuse me. Could you just skip ahead to ""I do's""? Go on. Go ahead and have some fun, if we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? Shrek, wait, wait a minute. You want to do this right, don't you? - What are you talking about? - It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for. The priest is going to say: ""Speak now or forever hold your peace"". And that's where you say: ""I object"". - I don't have time for this. - Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you? - Yes. - You want to hold her! - Yes. -Please her! -Yes! Then you got to, got to try a little tender love. - The chicks love that romantic crap. - All right. Cut it out. When does this guy say the line? We got to check it out. And as so by the power of these two... What do you see? - I now pronounce you... - There they go! - ... he all ready said it. - Oh, for 'the love of pit'. I object! Shrek? Oh, now what does he want? Hi, everyone. Having a good time, aren't you? I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean. - What are you doing here? - Really, it's rude enough being alive, when no one wants you. But showing up uninvited to a wedding... - Fiona! I need to talk to you. - Oh, now you wanna talk? Well it's a little late for that. So if you'll excuse me. - But you can't marry him! - And why not? Because, because he's just marrying you so he can be king. - Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him. - He's not your true love. - What do you know about true love? - Well, I... I'm in... Oh, this is precious. The Ogre has fallen in love with the princess. Laugh. Shrek. Is this true? Who cares. It's preposterious. Fiona, my love, we gonna kiss away for our happily ever after. Now kiss me! By night one way, by day another. I wanted to show you before. Well. That explains a lot. Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards. I order you to get them out of my sight. - Now! Get them! Get them, both! - No! This marriage is minding, and that makes me king. See? See? - Shrek! - No. - Don't just stand there, you dogs. - Get out of my way. No! Shrek! - And as for you my wife. - Fiona! I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I will have order. I will have potential. I will have... All right, nobody move! I got a dragon here and I'm not afraid to use it. I'm a donkey on the edge! Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they? Go ahead Shrek. - Fiona? - Yes, Shrek? I love you. Really? Really, really. I love you too. A time for true love's first kiss... Fiona? Fiona? Are you all right? Yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful. But you are beautiful. I was hoping this would be a happy ending. God bless us, everyone. The End., I still don't know why I'm here. Couldn't you just make them say yes? Yes, I could, but it's not my way. And I would expect you, of all people, would understand my feelings on misuse of power. Ah, power corrupts and all that. Yes, I know, Charles. - When are you going to stop lecturing me? - When you start listening. You're here because I need you. We don't have to meet every one of them in person? No. This one's special. What a beautiful campus. John, don't you think? Yeah, the brochure is great. But what about Jean? What about her illness? - Illness? - John. You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey? Perhaps it would be best if we were to speak to her. Alone. Of course. Jean, can you come down, dear? We'll leave you, then. It's very rude to read my thoughts, or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission. Did you think you were the only one of your kind, young lady? We're mutants, Jean. We're like you. Really? I doubt that. Oh, Charles. I like this one. You have more power than you can imagine, Jean. The question is, will you control that power? Or let it control you? Warren? Son, is everything all right? - What's going on? - Nothing. I'll be right out. Come on. You've been in there for over an hour. Open the door. Warren. One second! Open this door. Warren. Let me in there right now. Open the door. Oh, God. - Not you. - Dad, I'm sorry. - Not you. - Dad, I'm sorry. The whole world's going to hell and you're just going to sit there? Let's go. Bobby! Thanks, Kitty. - We're getting killed out here. - Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm. - Logan. - Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch. That was my last cigar. Logan. - It's getting closer. - Come on. Let's keep moving. Hey, Tin Man. Come here. - How's your throwing arm? - Logan, we work as a team. Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now. Dammit, Logan, don't do this. Class dismissed. Hey, Colossus. Nice throw. Simulation complete. - What was that? - Danger room session. - You know what I mean. - Lighten up. You can't change the rules. I'm trying to teach 'em something. - I taught 'em something. - It was a defensive exercise. Yeah, best defense is a good offence. Or is it the other way round? - This isn't a game, Logan. - Well, you sure fooled me. Hey, I'm just a sub. You got a problem, talk to Scott. - Scott! - Jean. Scott. Scott. Scott. Scott. - Are you OK? - I'm fine. You seem like you're avoiding me. Something's wrong. I can't touch my boyfriend without killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful. Hey. I don't think that's fair. Have I ever put any pressure on you? You're a guy, Bobby. Your mind's only on one thing. - They were looking for you. You didn't show. - What do you care? - For starters, I had to cover your ass. - I didn't ask you to. No, you didn't. The professor did. - I was just passing through. - So pass through, Logan. Hey, look. - I know how you feel. When Jean died... - Don't. Maybe it's time for us to move on. Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan. - Mr. Secretary. - Yes. - The meeting's begun, sir. - Thank you. Mr. President. Have a seat, Hank. Homeland Security was tracking Magneto. We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal. NAVSAT lost him crossing the border, but we did get a consolation prize. We picked her up breaking into the FDA. You know who she's been imitating? Secretary Trask here. Yes, sir. She can do that. - Not any more, she can't. We got her. - You think your prisons can hold her? We have some new prisons. We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead. Where is Magneto? Raven? - Raven, I asked you a question. - I don't answer to my slave name. Raven Darkholme. That's your real name, isn't it? Or has he convinced you you don't have a family any more? My family tried to kill me, you pathetic meat sack. OK, then. Mystique - where is he? In here with us. I don't want to play games with you. I want answers. You don't want to play games with me? You are going to stop this. Tell me, where is Magneto? You wanna know where he is? Homo sapien. You know, her capture will only provoke Magneto, but having her does give us some diplomatic leverage. On principle, I can't negotiate with these people. - I thought that's why you appointed me, sir. - Yes, it is. - But that's not why you called me here. - No. This is. It's what she stole from the FDA. Dear Lord. - Is it viable? - We believe it is. You realize the impact this'll have on the mutant community? Yes. I do. That's precisely why we need some of your diplomacy now. When an individual acquires great power, the use or misuse of that power is everything. Will it be for the greater good or will it be used for personal or for destructive ends? Now, this is a question we must all ask ourselves. Why? Because we are mutants. For psychics, this presents a particular problem. When is it acceptable to use our power and when do we cross that invisible line that turns us into tyrants over our fellow man? But Einstein said that ethics are an exclusive human concern without any superhuman authority behind it. Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know. This case study was sent to me by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones. The man you see here was born with no higher-level brain functions. His organs and nervous system work, but he has no consciousness to speak of. What if we were to transfer the consciousness of one person, say a father of four with terminal cancer, into the body of this man? How are we to decide what falls within the range of ethical behavior and what... Professor? We'll continue this tomorrow. Class dismissed. The forecast was for sunny skies. I'm sorry. I don't have to be psychic to see that something's bothering you. I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive, we've a mutant in the cabinet, a president who understands us - why hide? We're not hiding. But we still have enemies. I must protect my students. You know that. Yes, but we can't be students forever. Storm, I haven't thought of you as my student for years. In fact, I thought that perhaps you might take my place some day. - But Scott's... - Scott's a changed man. He took Jean's death so hard. Yes, things are better out there, but you, of all people, know how fast the weather can change. There's something you're not telling us. Hank? Ororo. Charles. I love what you've done with your hair. You too. Thank you for seeing me on such short notice. Henry, you are always welcome here. You're a part of this place. - I have news. - Is it Eric? No. Though we have been making some progress on that front. - Mystique was recently apprehended. - Who's the fur ball? Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs. Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit. - Henry, this is Logan. He's... - Wolverine. - I hear you're quite an animal. - Look who's talking. Magneto's gonna come get Mystique. Magneto's not the problem. At least not our most pressing one. A major pharmaceutical company has developed a mutant antibody. A way to suppress the mutant X gene. - Suppress? - Permanently. They're calling it a cure. That's ridiculous. You can't cure being a mutant. - Scientifically speaking... - When did we become a disease? Storm. They're announcing it now. These so-called mutants are people just like us. Their affliction is nothing more than a disease, a corruption of healthy cellular activity. But I stand here today to tell you that there's hope. This site, once the world's most famous prison, will now be the source of freedom for all mutants who choose it. Ladies and gentlemen... I proudly present the answer to mutation. Finally, we have a cure. Who would want this cure? I mean, what kind of coward would take itjust to fit in? Is it cowardice to save oneself from persecution? Not all of us can fit in so easily. - You don't shed on the furniture. - The government probably cooked this up. - The government had nothing to do with it. - I've heard that before. My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights since before you had claws. - Did he just call me boy? - Is it true? They can cure us? Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true. No. Professor. They can't cure us. You wanna know why? Because there's nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you. Or any of us, for that matter. How should we, as mutants, respond? Here's what I think. This is about getting organized. Bringing our complaints to the right people. We need to put together a committee and talk to the government. They don't understand. They don't know what it means to be a mutant. We need to show them, educate them, let them know that we're here to stay. People, you must listen. They won't take us seriously... - They wanna exterminate us. - This cure is voluntary. Nobody is talking about extermination. No one ever talks about it. They just do it. And you'll go on with your lives ignoring the signs all around you. And then one day, when the air is still and the night has fallen, they come for you. Then you realize, while you're talking about organizing and committees, the extermination has already begun. Make no mistake, my brothers. They will draw first blood. They will force their cure upon us. The only question is, will you join my brotherhood and fight? Or wait for the inevitable genocide? Who will you stand with? The humans? Or us? You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape. Back off. If you're so proud of being a mutant, where's your mark? I have been marked once, my dear. Let me assure you. No needle shall ever touch my skin again. You know who you're talking to? Do you? And what can you do? So you have talents? That and more. I know you control metal. And I know there's 87 mutants in here, none above a class three. Other than you two. You can sense other mutants and their powers? Could you locate one for me? Let me out of here. I demand that you release me. Do you know who I am? I'm the president of the United States. Oh, Mr. President. Shut up. Why are you doing this to me? Let me down. I'll be a good girl. Please let me go. Please. Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch. When I get out of here, I'm going to kill you myself. Yeah, right. Secretary McCoy, welcome to Worthington Labs. Thank you, Dr. Rao. Not an easy place to get to. It's the safest location we could find. That's why we keep the source of the cure here. He is a mutant. You understand our concern. - We are in compliance with your policy. - How long will you keep the boy here? Until we can fully map his DNA. We can replicate it, but we can't generate it. And his power? What is its range? You'll see. Jimmy. There's someone I would like you to meet. Hello there, son. - Hi. - My name is Hank McCoy. I'm sorry. It's OK. You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy. Extraordinary, isn't he? Yes, he is. Scott. Scott. Scott. - Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott. - Stop. - I'm here. Scott. Scott. - Stop it. - Scott. Scott. - Stop it. I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott. Stop! Jean? Scott. How? I don't know. I wanna see your eyes. - Take these off. - No. No. Trust me. I can control it now. Open them. You can't hurt me. - What happened? - No clue. - Professor, are you OK? - Get to Alkali Lake. - You don't want to be here. - Do you? I can't see a damn thing. I can take care of that. What the... Logan! She's alive. Jean. The sheer mass of water that collapsed on top of Jean should have obliterated her. The only explanation of Jean's survival is that her powers wrapped her in a cocoon of telekinetic energy. Is she gonna be OK? Jean Grey is the only class five mutant I've ever encountered, her potential limitless. Her mutation is seated in the unconscious part of her mind and therein lay the danger. When she was a girl, I created a series of psychic barriers to isolate her powers from her conscious mind. - Jean developed a dual personality. - What? The conscious Jean, whose powers were always in her control, and the dormant side. A personality that, in our sessions, came to call itself the Phoenix. A purely instinctual creature, all desire and joy and rage. - She knew all this? - It's unclear how much she knew. Far more critical is whether the woman in front of us is the Jean Grey we know, or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free. - She looks peaceful to me. - I'm keeping her that way. I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks and cage the beast again. What have you done to her? - You have to understand... - You're talking about a person's mind. - She has to be controlled. - Controlled? Sometimes, when you cage the beast, the beast gets angry. You have no idea. You have no idea of what she is capable. No, Professor. I had no idea what you were capable of. I had a terrible choice to make. I chose the lesser of two evils. It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all. I don't have to explain myself, least of all to you. History will be made here today. For the first time, the so-called mutant cure will be available to the public. Reaction has run the gamut with mutants on both sides of the line. Some are desperate for this cure while others are offended by the very idea of it. Will Secretary McCoy be a problem? Hard to say. His political views seem somewhat at odds with his personal issues. Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived. Good. Bring him in. Are you sure you want to start with him? I think it's important. Yes. - Hello, Warren. - How are you, son? - Did you sleep well? - Yeah. You know, I'm proud of you for doing this. Everything's gonna be fine. I promise. You ready? The transformation can be a little jarring. - Dad, can we talk about this for a second? - We've talked about it, son. It'll all be over soon. - Everything's going to be fine. - Wait. I can't do this. Warren, calm down. - I can't do this. - Yes, you can. - I can't do this. - Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down. - I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax. - Dad. Warren, it's a better life. - It's what we all want. - No. It's what you want. Warren, no! Told you so. About time. I've been busy. Did you find what you were looking for? The source of the cure is a mutant. A child at Worthington Labs. Without him, they have nothing. Read off the guest list. ""Cell 41205. James Madrox. "" This one robbed seven banks. - At the same time. - I could use a man of your talents. - I'm in. - Welcome to the Brotherhood. - Careful with this one. - ""Cain Marko. Solitary confinement. "" Check this out. ""Prisoner must be confined at all times. "" ""If he builds any momentum, no object can stop him. "" How fascinating. - What do they call you? - Juggernaut. - I can't imagine why. - Are you going to let me out? I need a pee. - Nice helmet. - Keeps my face pretty. I think he'll make a fine addition to our army. No! You saved me. Eric. I'm sorry, my dear. You're not one of us any more. Such a shame. She was so beautiful. Think resigning will make a difference? That's no way to influence policy. Policy is being made without me, Mr. President. The decision to turn the cure into a weapon was made without me. What happened on that convoy was inexcusable. But your actions... That was an isolated incident. You have to understand those mutants were a real threat. Have you even begun to think what a slippery slope you're on? I have. And I worry about how democracy survives when one man can move cities with his mind. As do I. You and I know that it's only going to get worse. All the more reason why I need to be where I belong. Jean. - Hi, Logan. - Welcome back. Back where we first met. Only I was in your place and you were in mine. Are you OK? Yeah. More than OK. Logan, you're making me blush. - You're reading my thoughts? - I don't have to. It's OK. It's OK. - Wait. - No. Jean. - This isn't you. - Yes, it is me. No. Maybe you ought to take it easy. The professor said you might be different. He would know, wouldn't he? What? You think he's not in your head too? Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you. Where's Scott? Jean? - Where am I? - You're in the mansion. You need to tell me what happened to Scott. Jean, tell me what happened to him. Oh, God. Look at me. Stay with me. Talk to me. - Look at me. Look at me. - No. Focus. Focus, Jean. Kill me. - What? - Kill me before I kill someone else. - Don't say that. - Please. - Stop it. - Kill me. Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean. It'll be all right. We can help you. Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it. I don't want to fix it. Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun. I told you they would draw first blood. - So what do we do? - What do we do? We use this weapon as a lightning rod to bring countless more to our cause. Come. We have an army to build. I picked something up. An electromagnetic force. It's massive. It's a mutant. Class five. More powerful than anything I've ever felt. More powerful than you. Where is she? Logan. - Jean. Jean. - What happened? What have you done? - I think she killed Scott. - What? - That's not possible. - I warned you. She's left the mansion, but she's trying to block my thoughts. She's so strong. It may be too late. - Wait for me here. - What? I need to see Jean alone. You were right, Charles. - This one is special. - What the hell are you doing here? Same as the professor. Visiting an old friend. - I don't want trouble here. - Nor do I. So, shall we go inside? I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere. - Just like old times, eh? - She needs help. Jean is not well. Funny, you sound just like her parents. Nobody gets inside. - I knew you'd come. - Of course. I've come to bring you home. - I have no home. - Yes, you do. You have a home and a family. You know he thinks your power is too great for you to control. I don't believe your mind games are going to work any more, Charles. - So you want to control me? - He does. No. I want to help you. Help me? What's wrong with me? - Absolutely nothing. - Eric, stop. No, Charles, not this time. You've always held her back. For your own good, Jean. Stay out of my head. - I'm going in. - The professor said he'd handle this. Look at me, Jean. I can help you. Look at me. Get out of my head. - Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles. - Trust me. You're a danger to everyone. - But I can help you. - I think you want to give her the cure. Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved because you couldn't control your power. No! Stop it! That's it. Jean, let me in. No, Jean. Jean! Don't let it control you. Charles. My dear. Come with me. No. God! We live in an age of darkness. A world full of fear, hate and intolerance. But in every age, there are those who fight against it. Charles Xavier was born to a world divided. A world he tried to heal. A mission he never saw accomplished. It seems the destiny of great men to see their goals unfulfilled. Charles was more than a leader, more than a teacher. He was a friend. When we were afraid, he gave us strength. And when we were alone, he gave us a family. He may be gone, but his teachings live on through us, his students. Wherever we may go, we must carry on his vision. And that's a vision of a world united. Kitty. Bobby. - You OK? - Yeah. It's just... Xavier came to my house. He was the one that convinced me to come here. Yeah, me too. - We're all feeling the same way, you know. - No, Bobby, we're not. You have Rogue and I have... You know, I just miss home. The first snow and all that. - Kitty, get up. Come with me. - Storm told us to stay in our rooms. Don't worry. We won't get caught. I mean, you can walk through walls, you know. Come on. This place can be home too. Thank you for this, Bobby. You need a lift, kid? No. Where are you going? You don't know what it's like to be afraid of your powers, afraid to get close to anybody. Yeah, I do. I want to be able to touch people, Logan. A hug. A handshake. A kiss. I hope you're not doing this for some boy. Look, if you wanna go, then go. Just be sure it's what you want. Shouldn't you be telling me to stay? To go upstairs and unpack? I'm not your father. I'm your friend. Just think about what I said, Rogue. Marie. Marie. Remember when we first met? Do you know what I saw when I looked at you? I saw the next stage in evolution both Charles and I dreamt of finding. And I thought to myself, ""Why would Charles want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"" I can manipulate the metal in this, but you, you can do anything. Anything you can think of. Jean. Enough. Enough. You sound just like him. Jean, he wanted to hold you back. - What do you want? - I want you to be what you are. As nature intended. That cure is meant for all of us. If we want freedom, we must fight for it. And that fight begins now. She shouldn't be here with us. - Her power is completely unstable. - Only in the wrong hands. - And you trust her? She's one of them. - So were you once. I stuck with you. Would have killed the professor if you'd given me the chance. Charles Xavier did more for mutants than you'll ever know. My single greatest regret is that he had to die for our dream to live. So what now? What do we do? Xavier started this school. Perhaps it's best that it end with him. - We'll tell the students they're going home. - Most of us don't have anywhere to go. I can't believe this. I can't believe we're not going to fight for this school. I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time. I was told that this was a safe place for mutants. It was, son. And it still is. We'll find you a room. Hank, tell all the students the school stays open. Rogue. Hey, Rogue. - Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue? - Yeah, she took off. Logan. Logan. - Logan. - Jean? Logan. Where am I? Logan. Logan. Logan. - Logan. - Stop. Logan. Logan. Logan. - Where are you going? - Where do you think? - She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back. - You don't know that. She killed the professor. It wasn't Jean. The Jean I know is still in there. Listen, why can't you see the truth? - Why can't you just let her go? - Because... because... Because you love her. She made her choice. Now it's time we make ours. So if you're with us, then be with us. We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! Getting the cure so you can go back home to mommy and daddy? I'm looking for someone. Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend. I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic. Come on, Iceman. Make a move. Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight. Today's attack was only our first salvo. So long as the cure exists, our war will rage. Your cities will not be safe. Your streets will not be safe. You will not be safe. And to my fellow mutants, I make you this offer... Join us or stay out of our way. Enough mutant blood has been spilled already. We're trying to track them, sir. We're working hard. - We cannot let him do this. - You know I agree, sir. This is now a national security matter. Seize and secure Worthington Labs. I want troops armed with cure weapons deployed immediately. And Trask, you have to find Magneto and stop him by any means necessary. Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one. Let's go. Keep it moving. Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal. Bayonets, magazines, dog tags. Pick up your plastic weapons. Pick up your cure cartridge. Absolutely no metal. We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! They wish to cure us. But I say to you we are the cure. The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition called homo sapiens. They have their weapons. We have ours. We will strike with a vengeance and a fury that this world has never witnessed. And if any mutants stand in our way, we will use this poison against them. We shall go to Alcatraz Island, take control of the cure, and destroy its source. And then nothing can stop us. Jean. I know the smell of your adamantium from a mile away. - I didn't come here to fight you. - Smart boy. - I came for Jean. - You think I'm keeping her against her will? - She's here because she wants to be. - You don't know what you're dealing with. I know full well. I saw what she did to Charles. And you stood there and let him die? - I'm not leaving here without her. - Yes, you are. OK. Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President. We have a satellite feed of Magneto's base of operations. - How did we find it? - She gave us everything we wanted. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Approaching target dead ahead. Set for 360-degree incursion. This is Team Leader to Bravo One. We are green to go. OK, send them in. OK. Freeze, mutants! Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air! OK. I give up. Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy. If he's not there, then where the hell is he? Worthington Labs. It ends where it began. - Are you sure the boy is still inside? So how are we supposed to get there? 'Cause I don't swim. Leave that to me. Storm. Storm. What are you doing back here? I need help. - You found her. - Yeah. She's with Magneto. - Where are they? - On the move. I know where they're going. - You're saying you saw Magneto? - We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz. - There are troops stationed on that island. - Not enough to stop him. Let's suit up. - Hard to believe this once fit me. - If Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him. - Can you estimate how many he has? - An army. And Jean. - His powers have limits, hers do not. - There's only six of us, Logan. Yeah. We're outnumbered. I'm not gonna lie to you. But we lost Scott. We lost the professor. If we don't fight now, everything they stood for will die with them. I'm not gonna let that happen. Are you? Then we stand together. X- Men. All of us. We're in. Let's go. - They're ready. - Yeah, I know. But are you ready to do what you need to do when the time comes? Dad, what's going on? It's an earthquake. We're trapped. Charles always wanted to build bridges. My God. Fall back! Take cover! Fall back! The boy's in the southeast corner of the building. - Well, then. - Let's take it down! In chess, the pawns go first. Humans and their guns. Plastic. They've learned. That's why the pawns go first. Target the bridge. Fire! Arclight, use your shockwaves. Target those weapons. - Oh, my stars and garters. - Go into stealth mode. - What aboutjets? Tanks? - Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out. - Where are our ground troops? - 30 minutes away. Then God help us. They're coming for him. Don't ever do that again. You men cover the doors! Everybody get together! And hold this line! Traitors to their own cause. Finish them! Not yet. Go inside and get the boy. And kill him. With pleasure. Hold it! He's going for the boy! Not if I get there first. Kitty! Come on. Grow those back. Don't you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut, bitch. Going somewhere? You're the guy that invented the cure, right? Yes, I am. Girls. No. Don't. Don't hurt him. - No. Don't hurt him. - Let go of me. I didn't do anything. Calm down. Calm down. Everything's gonna be OK. - I thought you were a diplomat. - As Churchill said, ""There comes a time... "" Oh, you get the point. Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't. No. No, don't worry. I'm here to help you. I'm going to get you out of here. This way. - Oh, my God. What's going on? - Your powers won't work with me. - Stay close, all right? - OK. I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with. Who's hiding, dickhead? Don't. No. Don't. Please, don't do this. I only wanted to help you people. Do we look like we need your help? It's time to end this war. Take cover. Get out of the way. - Let's go, let's go. - Move. Go! Go! Go! We work as a team. Best defense is a good offence. Bobby, think you can take out your old friend? Go ahead. Storm, we're gonna need some cover. Right. You're in over your head, Bobby. Maybe you should go back to school. You never should have left. This is it. Hey. Make it a strike. You never learn, do you? Actually, I do. I'm... One of them? This is what they want for all of us. It's over, Jean. It's over. No! Don't shoot! No! Everybody get out of there! Bobby! What have I done? I'm the only one who can stop her. Get everyone to safety. Go. Jean! Jean! I know you're still there! You would die for them? No, not for them. For you. For you. Save me. I love you. You're back. I'm sorry. I had to. - This isn't what I wanted. - I know. It's what I want. Hey. Good to see you, buddy. With the thanks of a grateful nation I introduce our new ambassador to the United Nations, and the representative to the world for all United States citizens, human and mutant alike, Dr. Hank McCoy. Way to go, fur ball. Morning. Hello, Moira. Charles. Ripeados por Tylerg Visita www.clan-sudamerica.com.ar, This is my bath water. There it is, going down the drain. My soap. My passport, with no occupation on it... but I'm a film editor. That's my Nagra 3. Actually, it's not mine. I'm borrowing it from work. I'm borrowing this film, too, because I'm shooting everything. This is the little fern that Marlene and I bought... when we first moved in together. Wow, it's grown. It's just been a few months. I bought these shoes for her. They do not fit her and she still wears them. This is my strong French coffee. And this is... really stupid. Or is it? I don't know. Start again. Paris, September 1st, 1969. Time is 9:30. These are pieces of me. Me in pieces. I'm trying to find what's real, what's honest. The total opposite of the film I'm editing... which is a sci-fi picture about a secret agent... Codename: Dragonfly. Bonjour. Wake up. Wake up. Rise and shine, Dragonfly. It is time for you to wake up. It is a beautiful day today. You have many secret missions to accomplish today. It's so early. It is 2:00 in the afternoon, Dragonfly. Can't I sleep? I never get to sleep. Would you like to hear your horoscope? It's good today. Mystery will be revealed when the moon makes its orbit. I love a mystery. Fly Dragonfly Seek you out from undercover Could you be my lover? Together we can fly Together we can fly Fly The water's freezing. We are making cinema together! We are making revolution! Did I ever tell you that I was the one who discovered her? You're wonderful. Oh, yes. Like that. Yes. Very good. This is Marlene sleeping. She's mad at me today. I asked her if she passed her driving test. Don't you think I would tell you if I had passed? Leave me alone! Yesterday she was happy. Everything is important. It's all in the details, they say. This is the beginning of a new cinema. It's so delicious. It's personal, but not pretentious. - It was beautiful. - Definitive. It's such an emotion to see a film like that. - Daring. Mature. - Why are you in Paris? - Which vitamin do you prefer? - Let him speak. Gentlemen, we can find out more about a man by his dreams. I guess I've always been a bit of a daydreamer. Always interested in film. A lot my thoughts... my little notions of things and feelings... are like little scenes in my head. I guess I want to show people what I think about. What I think is touching or sad or funny... Oops. I didn't realize you were filming. It sounded like you were talking to yourself. Just because you film every possible thing in your life... doesn't mean you'll understand yourself any better. I'll tell you everything you need to know. Go ahead. Turn it on. Go ahead. Tell me. You're a warm person... but closed off emotionally. You're self-absorbed and live in a fantasy world. - Come on. - Let me talk. It's true. You've come to Paris to find your life... but it is in front of you, and you won't admit it. You film all the details of things around you... as if that would bring some understanding. I just want to capture what's real and honest. And what if it's boring? Did you ever think about that? It may not be interesting for others to watch. You're mad at me now, aren't you? Come on. Let me fix your hair. I'm just thinking about work. We've been cutting the ending for two weeks now. The director has no idea how to end the picture. And he won't admit it. Kiss me. What are you thinking about? She stands there, looking at him. She leans closer and says... I love you. And we have the ending. It all comes together. This shot is not finished yet. They emerge from the tunnels... and the sun rises... and we see she's joined the revolution. And so... it ends with a simple declaration of love. It ends with a beginning. Yes, a circle. Circle. Sort of circle. It's great. Is that the original ending? You don't have an ending! We make an action movie with no action! It doesn't make any sense! I haven't shot the end yet. My vision is to subvert the audience expectations. I want the end, not with a bang... but with a whimper. No picture of mine ever ended with a whimper! We need a bang! The picture is not watchable! If you're thinking of changing one frame of my revolution... - You're off the picture! - What? Each moment I spend with you, I'm losing money. Fabrizio, shut down this production. What are you saying? You're off the picture! Fabrizio, I don't want to see him ever again! Go! Go away! - You're afraid of this film! - You're not director! - You fascist! You go away! - Andre! It's the young actress! She's gone to his head! Finalmente. Eh? Bullshit! I have seen this happen many times before. A director falls for the leading lady... and his judgment goes to the toilet. Fabrizio, fire everybody involved with this mess. I have made 63 pictures, and this is the worst. See if you can bring in... Felix DeMarco. The young director. Call him, now. One, two, three, four. Break on me! One, two, three! Break out. Something's not right here. Felix DeMarco. Now, if I'm being totally honest... which is the point of this film... just hearing his name fills me with envy. And I don't even know why I care so much. They can do whatever they want. I have this film. My film. So much has happened since yesterday. I lost my job. I need to find a camera. No more borrowing film. Need to conserve stock. Stay on track. Everything's changing, becoming clearer. I feel like it might be all over with Marlene. I need some time to figure things out. Maybe we should live apart for a little while. No. It's me. It's all me. She'll slip into bed without a word... without even a hello. Maybe a scowl... and I'm going to stop her this time. I missed him. Did you miss me? Yes! How was your day? How was your day? Don't get it. Let's kiss. Hello? Hey, Pippo. Really? What, right now? OK, OK. They fired everybody this morning... and now they just hired me back... and I have to go to meet the new director. You're going now? Till the weekend. I'm sorry. Call them and tell them you'll go tomorrow. There's nothing I can do. I just get back, you fucking ass! Why are you leaving me right now? I'll make a nice salad for you. I have to go. I'm sorry. I'm going to cut. Let's go again. Can we get some more blood? - Thanks for coming so quickly. - Sure. I'm glad you're still working on the picture. Do you know this young director, Felix DeMarco? Yeah, I met him before. He's an ass. Over there. You look very scary, and action! A certain number of virgins must be given up to Satan. I now give you to my master, His Highness of Darkness... where you will slumber forever in the tomb of Satanic blood. And... cut! Print that one. It was perfect, everyone. Let's go to lunch. Come on, baby. You are getting better and better every day. Unbelievable. - Enzo! - Felix. Follow me. What this picture needs, Felix, is you. It needs youth, and also... a better ending. Felix, this is Paul. He is the editor. I know this guy. How you doing? You did sound on the speedway picture, right? I pulled cable for you. I was awful at it, though. Enzo, Paul's also done the second unit on the picture. Second unit. That's fantastic. Go ahead and tell Felix the plot of the picture. I would tell you myself, but I'm lousy with English. Go on. It's a science fiction film set in... It's a good little idea, Felix. You'll make it great. Use the footage we have. Cut here, cut there. Add some action, more of the girl. Very sexy. I like it sexy, Enzo. Keep telling the story. - It's set in the future... - The year is 2001. We have one hell of a setup. Real sexy stuff. Go ahead, Paul. Go. Go. There's a group of revolutionaries... hiding out on a moon base... and there's only one answer. Gentlemen, I want to thank you for attending... this emergency security session. This visual report will illustrate our problem. Recent intelligence reports... indicate that a band of youthful revolutionaries... have set up a secret base in the far out region... of the dark side of the moon. Their leader is a man who's known as Mr. E. His many followers regard him as a great poet... orator, inventor, and expert in martial arts. He appears to be leading his group in training exercises... which we believe are linked to a plan to attack Earth... to spread his dangerous anarchistic philosophy. Not since our troubles began way back in May, 1968... have we seen such a cause for concern. Most distressing are the reports... that he has developed a top-secret weapon... which we feel we must capture to preserve our way of life. Gentlemen, we're left with only one option. To use Agent Codename: Dragonfly. - But she's so expensive. - And so difficult. I know she's exasperating, but we need her. Now, I've arranged a teleconference. Please, Agent Dragonfly. We had an appointment. I need my sleep. We need to get down to business. OK. What is it? Your mission is to infiltrate the community... by whatever means available... find Mr. E, and take possession of his weapon. He's pretty cute, isn't he? Please. Are you prepared to accept this mission? I'll take the mission, but you know how much I cost. Of course. We're relying on you, Dragonfly. The future of the world is in your hands. So, are you prepared to take this mission? If you can meet my price. That sounds like fun. I love science fiction. I could probably make this amazing. I want to tighten it up... reshoot some things, fix the ending... because you don't seem to have that... and... I could start once the vampire picture wraps. Perfect. While Felix shoots... we continue with the trailer and the looping. Felix, give the editor your thoughts on the trailer. Stick to Felix like glue. Hear his ideas, his visions. Write it. Yes, we have to go. We have another projection. The Three Killers, no? It just hit me. I know how the trailer needs to be. Are you going back to set? I'll let you know if I get any other great ideas! And we're up! We're back! I want two cameras and another here with me! We're going to do two! So, we finally meet. I like what I see. - I'm Paul. - Valentine. - Very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. The director's still on his way. I'll just get us set up in the meantime. Sorry about my voice. My apartment's flooding. I'm getting a cold. You'll be fine. Maybe it's... I was just... I was just... - Would you like some tea? - Yeah. Paul... Felix is missing. Go ahead and get the session going. Come on. Yes, yes. People, come on. - Ever done this before? - No. It's pretty easy. There you go. So, we finally meet. I like what I see. I have a mission, which I intend to accomplish. I love you. I love you. I'm so in love with you. Do you love me? I'm in love with you. I love you. That's OK. Changing rolls. Sorry. You have an eyelash right here. If you blow on it, you can make a wish. I wish cats could talk. You're not supposed to tell me. It won't come true. I'm sure it'll come true. My cat's pregnant. I wish I could talk to her. - Can I get you to sign this? - Sure. You must be the director. How exactly you want me to do this? With a lot of authority, or maybe more playful? Who is Dragonfly? She's a super-sexy secret agent. But that's top secret. Dragonfly is coming. - How do you like it? Good? - It's great. You hear me? One, two, three. You hear me? Dazzling? It's OK. Dazzling is terrific. Dragonfly is terrific. - Everything else good. - It's great. Thank you. Thanks. Just try them. Where'd she go? Out that way. Who is Dragonfly? Hi, Valentine. Felix DeMarco, the director. How are you? Sorry I'm late. I'm just... crazy. Actually, we already finished. Oh, great. Want to get a bite to eat? Sure. - Do you have any francs? - Yeah. I do. I'm fresh out. I know a little great place. Do you use The Method? Do we have to do this now? Yeah. That's the thing. I have to do it, even if I don't want to. It's the only way to be honest and real. Have you seen my light meter? You didn't tell me your father was coming for Christmas. I'm sorry. I forgot. He's on a lecture tour. Just be passing through the airport for an hour or two. Asked me to meet him there. You never tell me anything. What was the actress like? She's a nice girl. And? Am I in frame? Today is December 20th, 1969. I have to stay focused. Complete honesty. Do you love me? You know how I feel about you. You just want me to say it in front of my camera? Why can't you just say it? I sew your ripped pants. I trip over your camera. I love you, of course. I just don't want to run out of film. What are you looking for? What do you mean? What is your biggest wish? That cats could talk. Something that girl said, isn't it? What are you talking about? You're being silly. I thought you had to be totally honest in this film. I am. You're being ridiculous. Who said that? That actress? You want to sleep with her! - Now, that's ridiculous. - What is your problem? I can't believe you! I just don't understand! We need to talk. Hey, Paul. Ready to go to the party? Let me drive. Did you pass your driving test finally? Maybe you can drive on the way home. I got a call from the hospital. Felix was in a car accident. Smashed up his Alfa. The doctor said he was OK. Just broke his leg. He's getting out of the Dragonfly picture... taking a break. - Really? - Yeah. I want to recommend you to Enzo. Me? I think you should finish the film. I know you can do a good job. You're a talented kid. You have helped the picture a lot. I have seen that... in the second unit shots I have gotten. The footage of the cosmic rays... that was your idea. It's a good idea. We talk to him tomorrow. It is sonic boom of the Concorde. It's so fucking amazing. We're living in the future, man. ...acting is to the scenario. I found this great place in St. Germain. Would you excuse me one second? I've got some big news. Can't you see I'm talking to someone right now? Give me two minutes. Excuse me, you were saying? It's called theater of revolution. It's going to be a movement, a voice, a poetry workshop. I'm sure you'd love this place. - Did you hear about poor Felix? - I hope he's OK. He's so talented. Working with him is so much fun. I remember once, when we finished early... and he took us all to the go-kart ride. Oh, God! Come here. - That nobody can deny... - Hey, babe! For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow It's Felix DeMarco! That nobody can deny That nobody can deny Thank you. Thank you. So kind. Ladies and gentlemen... I'd like to make an announcement. I'm sure you've probably heard... about the mad events of this evening... but we're OK, right? But there's one more thing that happened. I asked Brigit to marry me... and she said yes! And so, we can't wait one moment further... and we're setting sail tomorrow. Don't stand around staring at us! Let's dance! Dad. Dad. Hey, you all right? Yeah. I misplaced my glasses on the plane. Thank you very much. Let me hold your hand. Hold on. Wait. I took a sleeping pill, and I ate all the ice cream. It's good to see you. Good to see you at Christmas, even briefly. Wait a second. I brought you something. Thanks, Dad. I had a dream the other night... and I thought of you. Well, you were in it. I was watching these... hideous films of Vietnam on the television. And I had this deep, desultory dream... where I met a son that I didn't know I had. And he looked like you. You were there, too. Two brothers. But then I realized that he was a soldier in the war. And when I woke up, I had these... these feelings of worry and of loss. And I wondered... this is curious... could I have had a child by another woman... and never known about it? Isn't that a curious thought? I think about it sometimes and... What if I met a boy and he looked like you? Maybe it's really my son. Sometimes I'll be driving down the street... and I'll see someone who looks familiar... like it could be my brother. You know? So, maybe it's true, Dad. It is possible, Paul. I wasn't always faithful to your mother. When I was your age... all I could think about was women. It was like a disease or a curse. I think I know what you mean, Dad. Kids are nice. When do you think you'll have some of your own? I don't know, Dad. Have you thought about coming back home? Your mother wanted me to ask you. I don't know. Excuse me. We found your glasses. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Wow. I think it's time to go. I'm very glad for you, Paul. I know you'll do well in this new job of yours. What is it? It's a science-fiction film... about a futuristic spy named Dragonfly. That's interesting. Your grandmother used to call dragonflies... the Devil's darning needles. She told me that they come in the night... and stitch up your mouth if you use profanity... or were otherwise voluble. This isn't exactly about that. Maybe you can use it somehow. Thanks, Dad. You never know when some little overheard story... or image can find a place in your work. Here. - OK, see you. - See you. How was it seeing your father? It was nice. He told me about this strange dream that he had. I'm going out to get some milk. Action! Give me some screaming, girls. Louder! Now give me some moaning. Louder! You did good work on the trailer. Thank you, sir. Fabrizio says you know the space picture... better than anyone else... and thinks you should take over. He usually knows what he's talking about. So, you make some shorts, films, things like that? - I'm working on a film. - Come here. Now, there are two kinds of movies. Those with an ending, and those without an ending. This movie needs an ending. I've made some fifty pictures... and this is my advice... the ending is the most important part of the movie. The part that people remember when they leave the theater... but everybody works on it last when they are exhausted. So, listen to me... and figure out how to end this picture... with an exciting twist. And that we can do it in two days. Yes, that we can shoot in two days! I'll be in Rome for the holidays... and Fabrizio will get you out there... and you can show me what you're thinking. Francheschino! And you... astonish me. I'll have a cocktail. Your cocktail is ready, Dragonfly. Attention, all comrades. We will soon be ready to leave our lunar domes... to descend and bring change to Earth. We need to be free... to make love all day. Every day. Must be free. So... we finally meet. I like what I see. I've been expecting you. Hope you're not disappointed. I knew it was only a matter of time... before they sent in Agent Codename: Dragonfly. You've got quite a reputation. Really? Tell me about it. Work with the revolution, Dragonfly. Join us. I have a mission... which I intend to accomplish. There she is! Fabulous. Preparing boosters. Stand by. There she is! There's too many loose ends here. This gun... What is so special about this gun? We got a Christmas gift. Have a look. It's a present from the guys in the screening room. What a temper. Andrezej was so mad that day. The mysterious, dark figure. Who should that be? Paul, relax. It's just a movie. I can't find reel seven here. What is this? Oh, Madonna. Paul, reel seven. It will take me days to put it back together. A message. It's written in the code from the movie. Yeah. Film 37. Checking code book. All right. D-e... ""Defilers beware. ""Defilers beware, exclamation point?"" Who sent this? Andrezej. Oh, God, Andrezej. It has to be him. He has a key to the door. This is bad news. Damn. I knew it. He's crazy! And you know what? I'm sure he cut the brakes on Felix's car. Jesus. You know... I'm calling the locksmith. You know what? You better watch out, Paul. Damn. He's crazy. I knew it! He cut the film in a million pieces. I want to see your soul in action. I love you. Take your time. Not so fast. - I love you. - Like that, yes. Say ""I'm in love with you."" I'm in love with you. - One more time. - Shut up. Transmission breach. Need assistance. Need assistance. Ship's been damaged. Hey, you got my message. Come in. It must be freezing out. I've tried everything to fix this... but I can't figure out how it goes back together. Let me take a look. You look cold. I'm all right now. We'll be out of here in no time. What are you doing on the moon? I don't know. I think I'm lost. Dragonfly... what happens in the end? I don't know, but don't worry. We're going to find out soon. Hey, what happened? Are you OK? Was someone here? I'm just sad. I'm losing all my patience with you. You talk to your camera night and days... but you never talk to me. Why don't you say anything to me? What should I say? I don't know what to say. I'm sorry you're sad. Come here. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know if I have any ideas. They want something that I'm not sure I can give them. Maybe I should just go to Rome and tell them... ""I don't know what to do with your idiotic story."" It's not even my film. And this ending... Paul, I'm glad you're saying all this to me... but I don't care about the stupid film. I care about us like we used to be. Come here. Come here. Now go. Go to Rome. Do what you like... but just remember that you bring everything upon yourself. That came for you. You spent all your money on a camera. You are here. These are good, don't you think? It's very nice. Not too bad. Sit down. Good, good, good. OK, so... do you have a great ending for me? I recut most of the picture... to make it shorter and clearer. And one of my ideas is to take Mr. E's gun... and make it a little more special... so it can temporarily freeze people. Freeze people. Sounds good. And that's how they plan to take over. What about the ending? The alley... Dragonfly's running, chasing after the guy. What happens? Well... I have a few ideas. That's the problem. You got too many ideas. We just need one good one. Look, son, this is my thirty-seventh picture. I've worked with some of the best in the business... and I've learned a few little tricks. One of them is to always try to make the audience... wonder what's going to happen. And then at the end, you tell them... but you surprise them a little, eh? Easy. Look, it's New Year's Eve. You are going to the party. Come with us. Let's have fun. Oh, my little monster. Julietta. Come on, come with us. Paul, go ahead to the party. Have a good time. We'll be right back. Valentine! There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you. Listen, I know you've been working on that ending... which is exciting because it got me thinking. This ending has to be fabulous. I imagine a new scene. I'm parachuting down to Earth... Where did you go? You just left me standing there. Excuse me. I'm talking to my director. Thank you. I think I'll just walk. Hold on. There you go. - Are you English? - American. What are you doing here? I don't know. What are you doing here? My friend is waiting for a boy. He's in the army. They haven't seen each other for one year. He wrote her and say that he would run away... from the army and meet her here tonight. It's a whole new decade... but it still feels the same to me. So, let's hear it. So, Dragonfly's running through the tunnel. She comes to the figure hidden in the shadows. And the figure emerges. And the figure... Your book! That cats could talk. I thought you had to be totally honest in this film. - Absolutely pretentious. - Indulgent. You're just fucking blowing it. This film is too fractured. It's confusing. It's an aggression for your eyes, for my eyes. Especially the shot where you sit on the toilet. Where's the story? Where's the structure? I don't care about this person. Do you think you are clever? I just wanted to make something... that would reflect who I am, who I was. It was a difficult and confusing time. What's the point? What am I supposed to do? And regarding that space project you're involved in... there's no snow on the moon. - Wait! - You should know that. What should I do? You need to connect things so they make us feel something. You surprised me. I didn't see you there. - You look beautiful. - Thanks. Would you please let me know if I'm not doing something right? It's my first day, so... It'll be fine. Remind me about the scene in the story... right before the one we're shooting. You... I mean, Dragonfly had just barely escaped... with this special gun from the dark side of the moon. How does my spaceship get fixed? I came to the moon and fixed it for you. Then you landed safely in Paris. Landing successful. Please notify the Corporation that the mission's complete. Affirmative. You didn't knock. I wanted to surprise you, my darling. Dragonfly Tell me, how can you resist her Until your lips have kissed her She'll be a mystery Please don't try to stop me. I'm sorry. He kills me? The gun doesn't work on you. Why not? I'll explain later, but what happens... is the gun actually has a special property. The revolution depends on this weapon... The gun freezes people. Interesting. So, what happens next? Incoming call on cine-com. Do you have possession of the package? Please respond. Affirmative. I'm sorry. Bring it down. You all right? Sorry, I didn't realize... I'm fine. My foot... All right, we'll go again. It was our fault. Bring her up, please. Someone stole the exposed film. Paul, go. Here. Are you scared? Oops. - You OK? - Yeah. - You sure? - I'm fine. Go. How could you betray me? Destroy my artwork, you little shit! Do you think that you can make a better ending... by putting in your car chase? What about the theme? The story? Have you thought about that, Paul? - I wasn't trying... - Bullshit! Don't move! I'm warning you! I'm sorry. It's a big opportunity for me... You want to know the real reason? They are afraid about the film. They're trying to keep the youth rebellion suppressed. A film can change the course of the future. It can invent the future by making ideas concrete. That's why when I heard you were changing the ending... I was forced to do this. I had an idea. I had a new idea for the ending, that maybe she... the Corporation, its center, betrays her. The revolutionary get their weapon back in the end. Promise me that, Paul. I promise. Good. I've been working on a personal film. Personal film? With no compromise, right? - Right. - We'll... see about you. I'm old. I can go now and write my personal work. Now that I have something to write about. I have to ask... Did you make love to her? Did you cut the brakes on Felix's car? Remember, Paul... always stand next to the camera. Your actor will feel you there... and will be playing just for you. I can't believe it. Bravo! Did they catch him? Who was the son of a bitch who stole the film? Just some old guy. It doesn't matter anyway. We got it back. It's all going to work out. We'll get the final footage tomorrow on the stage. - You did good, Paul. - Where's Valentine? Is she OK? She was fine. In fact, I think she enjoyed herself. She just left in a rush. She asked that you call her. She said it was important. Antonio, come on, eh? Hi, it's Paul. You got to come here quickly. Oh, my God! Taxi! Come look. They were just born. I like to document all the things of my life. I found you. I was cold. Thank you very much. All right. And... And action. But how? You're me. Quickly, we're in danger. Nice try, Dragonfly. Go, go! My father built the Dragonfly robot... for the most dangerous missions. He modeled her on me... her looks and her lifelike qualities. But the Corporation programmed her... so that she couldn't betray them. She wanted to help you, but she couldn't. That's why I tried to help. I knew the revolution needed this weapon... so I took it to give to you. I did it to help you, to help the cause. I believe in this revolution... and I believe in you. We were in love. We are identical in all respects. In all respects? In all respects. All I really did was stitch together things from my life. Things that made an impression on me. Just put a little piece of myself out there... try to organize it, take a look at it... make some connections, some sense of things. I think that's all the time we have. Thanks a lot to Paul. - Excuse me. - Yes? I enjoyed what you had to say. Thank you very much. By the way, do you know Felix DeMarco? Do you think you could pass this script on to him for me? - Sure. - Thanks. My dog knocked over the tripod, and the camera kept running... so I kept it all in the film. ...things around you... as if that would bring some understanding? I just want to capture what's real and honest. And what if it's boring? Maybe Marlene was right... but each one of these images brings up a feeling or a memory. I can smell Marlene when I see this shot of the soap. I found her drivers license... and I tried to reach her by calling her mother... and Marlene answered. When she heard my voice, she hung up. I thought that my film was going to be about... Iooking at all the pieces of myself... but, Marlene... I got you in pieces, too. So this is the end... or is it the start? Of what?, The Ring of the Fisherman, which bears the official papal seal, must be destroyed immediately following the Pope's death. The Papal apartment is then sealed for nine days of mourning, a period known as ""Sede Vacante"", the time of the empty throne. Over the last several days, Catholic leaders from every corner of the world have flocked to Rome, shocked by the sudden death of this progressive and beloved pope. Today, in St. Peter's Square, the faithful pray that there is among them another leader who can unite their church, which has been so riven by change and dissent in recent years. As the body of the pontif passes by, we see prayers are being offered by the Preferiti, favorites among those being considered to succeed him as the Vicar of Christ. At the end of the mourning period, the College of Cardinals will lock itself behind the doors of the Sistine Chapel for Conclave. The process by which they will choose a new leader for the world's one billion Catholics who now find their church at a crossroads, its ancient traditions threatened by a modern world.

Aiuto! - A swim might help your jet lag. - I beg your pardon? The bags under your eyes. It's five in the morning and you're from the Vatican. Crossed keys under the Triregnum. It's a papal symbol. Claudio Vicenze. Corpo della Gendarmeria Vaticano. Vatican Police? I was expecting another letter. My request for access to your archives. Shouldn't you be in Rome? Kind of a busy time for you guys, huh? In fact, I was in New York. A detail to the UN. I received a phone call in the middle of the night. ""Find Professor Robert Langdon. A matter of great urgency."" They said to show you this. The Illuminati? They disappeared hundreds of years ago. Did they? Look at that again. It's an ambigram. It's the same image, forward and backward. Now, that's common for a symbol like a Yin and Yang or a swastika but... that's a word. That Illuminati ambigramatic symbol has been considered a myth for 400 years. Supposedly, in the 16th century, some artist created it as a tribute to Galileo's love of symmetry. It was only gonna be revealed when the Illuminati had amassed enough power to resurface and carry out their final goal. I wrote a book about it. Which is why you're here. ""The Art of the Illuminati"" by Robert Langdon. Part One. I haven't been able to finish Part Two because I'm not allowed access to your archives. It's remarkable. Similar. Someone is trying to make you believe the Illuminati themselves have returned to Rome. Right after the death of a pope. Four cardinals were kidnapped from their quarter's inside the Vatican sometime between 3 and 5 am this morning. Shortly afterward, that document was sent to the office of the Swiss Guard along with the threat the Cardinals will be publicly executed one per hour begining at 8 pm tonight in Rome. The conclave? Was to begin today. We have postponed the start for a few hours with the story of illness. There are no suspicions... yet. What do you want from me? These criminals, who sent this ambigram, meant it as a taunt, a provocation. But Captain Olivetti think if you can use it to learn their identity, perhaps we can stop this abomination. Why me? Your expertise. Your erudition. Your recent involvement with certain church... shall we say... mysteries. I wasn't under the impression that episode had endeared me to the Vatican. Oh, it didn't. But it did make you, what is the word for... ""formidable""? Formidable? A Vatican jet is standing by twenty minutes from here. Will you come with me? Professor Langdon. You've spent your life searching for symbols like the one you now hold in your hand. How much longer are we going to pretend you have not already decided to come? If the Illuminati have returned and are in Rome, we will hunt them down and kill them. The Illuminati did not become violent until the 17th century. Their name means 'The Enlightened Ones'. They were physicists, mathematicians, astronomers. They were concerned with the church's inaccurate teachings and they were dedicated to scientific truth. But the Vatican didn't like that. So, the church began to, how did you say it? Oh. Hunt them down and kill them. Drove them underground into a secret society. - Professor Langdon. - Yes? Welcome to Vatican City. Ernesto Olivetti, Inspector General of the Vatican Police Force. My pleasure. This way please. We'll meet in the headquarters of the Swiss Guard. - I thought you were Swiss Guard. - No, uh, the Gendarmaria. We are responsible for everything inside the Vatican walls with the exception of the security of His Holiness... - Yeah. - ... and the Apostolic Palace. That is Swiss Guard. The Roman Carabinieri are here as well in an advisory capacity. So jurisdictionally this is... A goddamn nightmare. - Oh, yes. Pope Pius IX's great castration. - I beg your pardon? 1857. Pope Pius IX felt the male form would inspire lust. So, he took a hammer and chisel and 'un-manned' hundreds of these statues. The plaster fig leaves were added later. Are you anti-Catholic, Professor Langdon? No. I'm anti-vandalism. I urge you to guard your tone here. The Swiss Guard is a calling, not a profession, and it encourages a certain civiltry. Commander Richter, the head of the Guard, is a deeply spiritual man. He was close to the late Pope. Understood? Look, I dont study symbols because I consider them unimportant. Ceremony, traditions, heavily mark our lives. I just hope I can help. - So do I. You were my idea. Wait here. Please. Commander? Commander Richter? Doctor Vetra? I'm Commander Richter, principal of the Swiss Guard. Thank you for coming. Oh. Professor Langdon. What a relief. The symbologist is here. This way, please, Miss Vetra. The situation has changed. We received another threat from the kidnapper. The canister was stolen from my lab around noon yesterday. The intruder killed my research partner, Silvano Paintivolio and mutilated him in order to bypass security. We use retinal scanners. They cut out his eye. Is that your stolen canister, Ms. Vetra? - Where is that camera, number 86? - It's wireless. It, too, was stolen. It could be anywhere inside the Vatican walls. That canister contains an extremely combustible substance called antimatter. We need to locate it immediately. We evacuate Vatican City. I'm quite familiar with incendiaries, Miss Vetra. I've never heard of antimatter being used as such. Well, its never been generated in significant quantities before. It's a way of studying the origins of the universe. To try to isolate what some people call ""the God Particle"". But there are implications for energy, research-- ""God Particle""? What you call it isn't important. It's what gives all matter mass. The thing without which we could not exist. You're talking about the moment of creation. - Yes, in a way, I am. The antimatter is suspended there... in an airtight nano-composite shell with electromagnets on each end. But if it were to fall out of suspension, and come into contact with matter, say with the bottom of the canister, then, the two opposing forces would annihilate one another violently. What might cause it to fall out of suspension? The battery going dead. Which it will just before midnight. What kind of annihilation? How violent? A cataclysmic event. A blinding explosion equivalent to about 5 kilotons. Vatican City will be consumed by light. Those are the exact words the kidnapper used. We will destroy your four pillars. We will brand your Preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science. Then bring your church down upon you. Vatican City will be consumed by light. A shining star at the end of the Path of Illumination. It's the ancient Illuminati threat. Destruction of Vatican City through light. Four pillars. There's your kidnapped cardinals. You didn't tell me they were the Preferiti, the favorites to be named the next Pope. Play it again. We will destroy your four pillars. We will brand your Preferiti... Wait, stop it. Stop. Brand them? That's another Illuminati legend. This one says that there are a set of five 'Brands'. Each one an ambigram. The first four are the fundamental elements of science: earth, air, fire and water. Th fifth is a mystery. Maybe it's this. You said they'd be killed publicly. Yes. Revenge. For La Purga. La Purga? Geez, you guys don't even read your own history, do you? 1668. The church kidnapped four Illuminati scientists and branded each one of them on the chest with the symbol of the cross. To 'purge' them of their sins and they executed them, threw their bodies out in the street as a warning to others to stop questioning church rulings on scientific matters. They radicalized them. The Purga created a darker, more violent Illuminati. One bent on... on retribution. And look how they intend to finally get it. Using anti-matter. Technology to destroy the church. Science obliterates religion. Is there any more? ...and sacrifice them on the altars of science. Then bring your church down upon you. Vatican City will be consumed by light. A shining star at the end of the Path of Illumination. Path of Illumination? I need access to the Vatican archives. Professor, I don't think this is the appropriate moment-- Your petition has been denied seven times. No, no. This has- This has nothing to do with my work. The Path of Illumination is a hidden trail through Rome itself that leads to the Church of the Illumination. The place where the Illuminati would meet in secret. If I can find the ""Segno"", the sign, that marks the beginning of that path, the four churches along it. It may be where he intends to murder your Cardinals. One every hour. At 8, 9, 10 and 11. Then the device explodes at midnight. If we could figure out the first church and get there before he does, maybe we could stop it. But I can't find the start of the path until I get into the archives. Even if I wanted to help you, access to the archives is only by written decree by the curator on the Board of Vatican Librarians. Or by papal mandate. Yes, but, as you no doubt have heard, the Holy Father is dead. What about il Camerlengo? The Camerlengo is just a priest here. The former pope's chamberlain. Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest in him during ""Tempo Sede Vacante""? Fellas, you called me. His Holiness once told me the Pope is a man torn between the real world and the divine. It seems the real world is upon us tonight. I'm familiar with Illuminati lore and the legend of the brandings. The Purga is a dark stain on this church's history. I'm not surprised this ghost has returned to haunt us. Commandante, have you begun a search for this explosive device? Of course, but it could be anywhere. My primary concern at the moment is the safety of the cardinals. The Sistine Chapel is a fortress. As long as the cardinals are in conclave, your security concerns are at a minimum. Devote as many of your people-- Signore, if you are about to suggest a naked eye search of the entire Vatican City, I will tell you... - Commander. - ... I do not have the people. Although I am not His Holiness, when you are addressing me, you are addressing this office. Do you understand? - Yes, Father. - Good. Now, you said the image on the screen was illuminated by artificial light. Might I suggest methodically cutting power to various sections of the city? When the image on the screen goes dark, you'll have a more specific idea of the camera's location. Dr. Vetra, beside yourself and your research partner, who else knew about this antimatter project? No one but the research team. This project was strictly confidential. But Silvano kept detailed journals. If he told anyone else about what we were doing, he would have made a note of it. And do you have these journals? I can have them flown here from Geneva in an hour. Please. Professor Langdon. Mr. Langdon. You are correct that I may grant you access to the archives. Thank you, Padre. I said that you are correct that I may, not- not that I will. Christianity's most sacred codes are in that archive. Given your recent entanglement with the church, there is a question I'd like to ask you first, here, in the office of His Holiness. Do you believe in God, Sir? Father, I simply believe that religion... I did not ask you if you believe what man says about God. I asked if you believe in God. I'm an academic. My mind tells me I will never understand God. And your heart? Tells me I'm not meant to. Faith is a gift that I have yet to receive. Be delicate with our treasures. - The archives are this way. - Professor Langdon? If this path really leads to the Church of Illumination, that may be where they've hidden the antimatter. The shining star at the end of the path. I thought so, too. Follow the path and we may find the canister at the end of it. Can you deactivate the device? I can change the canister's batteries as long as we have more than five minutes of life. That would give us another 24 hours to get it safely back to CERN. - Robert Langdon. - Vittoria Vetra. Are you really a symbologist or was he mocking you? No. Both. You're a physicist? Bioentanglement Physics. The interconnective life systems? Okay. Your project... it was to give towards the energy research? Eventually, yes. One pack of antimatter could power an entire city for a month. Or tonight, I guess, destroy one. What are we looking for in the archives? - A banned volume written by Galileo. - Galileo was Illuminati? - Yeah, and an obedient Catholic. Who didn't think the church and science were enemies but just a different language telling the same story. Anyone of like minds could find the Church of Illumination. But he couldn't exactly advertise its location, so he created a coded path. Richter has started to turn off the power at various rates. It will be back on in a minute. Then some unknown Illuminati master sculpted four statues. Each one a tribute to one of the fundamental elements: earth, air, fire, water. And placed the statues out in public, in churches throughout Rome. Each statue held a clue pointing to the next. At the end of the path was the Church of Illumination. If you could find that, you were one of them. What makes you think he's going to murder the cardinals in the churches? The Illuminati called those four churches by the special name ""L'altare de la Scienza"". Sacrifice them on the altars of science, he said. Exactly. Oh, wow. Look at this. Excuse me. Signori. Cardinal Strauss, have you been informed of the situation? Yeah. My belief is we should proceed with the sealing of conclave. At this late hour? That would be highly unorthodox. And, yet, was ensured to wrought my power in great elective. The cruelest honor in Christendom. I have no personal ambitions, Patrick. Only those I hold for my church. St. Peter's church, which is someday taken at its most vulnerable moment. And this is not a coincidence. The church will not fall in a day. We must evacuate Vatican City. That is exactly what they want. Publicity and panic. No. We must not give them oxygen for the media fire. But the people in St. Peter's Square? Care deeply about their church, as we do. Their faith will sustain them. Their faith will not protect them from an explosion. We are all bound for heaven eventually, are we not? Spoken like one who has enjoyed the blessings of a long and full life. Patrick, do not confuse the power of the office you temporarily hold with your true place here at the Vatican. You were a favorite of His Holiness. But His Holiness is with his father now. Mea culpa. Seal the doors. Everyone outside. This way, please. Oh. Beautiful. The chambers are hermetic vaults. Oxygen is kept at the lowest possible level. It is a partial vacuum inside. So, extended stays are not recommended. So, don't panic if you feel light headed at first. I'll be just outside the door, watching you, Mr. Langdon. Conclave will go on without us. It must. Now of all times. May God forgive you for what you have done. Father, if God has issues, they won't be with what I've done. They will be with what I'm about to do. It was confiscated from the Netherlands by the Vatican just after Galileo died. I've been petitioning to see it for about ten years. Ever since I realized what was in it. What makes you so sure that this thing is there? The number 503. I kept seeing it, over and over again. In Illuminati letters. Scribbled in the margins. Sometimes just signed '503'. It's a numeric clue, but, to what? Five? Well, that's a medieval number to the Illuminati. There's the pentagram. Pythagoras. Dozens of other examples in science. But what about 3? It didn't make sense, until I thought: What if it's Roman numerals? DIII. - D3. Galileo's third text. Dialogo. Discorso. Diagramma. Just a few days with this and I could've actually finished my book. And sold dozens of copies at the Harvard bookstore. Il Diagramma Veritatis. Diagram of Truth. I know about the Dialogo and the Discorsi. Galileo laid out his theories about the earth revolving around the sun. Right. It said the earth was not the center of some universe with heaven above, hell below, as the church had said it was. So, they forced him to recant his second book. But what was this one? This is how he got the word out. This is the truth. Not what the Vatican forced him to write. Smuggled out of Rome, printed in Holland on setched papyrus. See? That way, any scientist that was caught with a copy could just throw it in water and Galileo's heresy would disolve. Disappear. Between that and Vatican burnings it's possible this is the only copy that remains. And if I'm correct, the segno is hidden on page number... Five. Yeah. Do you need help with the Latin? Sure. Movement of the planets, elliptical orbits, idiosyntricity... Sorry. I don't think there's anything that could be interpreted as a... Wait, wait, wait. Do that again. What is that? Wait. It's a watermark. And there's a line of text. Go back. It's in English. English? Why English? English wasn't used in the Vatican. It was too polluted. It's free thinking. It was the language of radicals, like Shakespeare and Chaucer. Here's another one. ""The path of light is laid a sacred test. "" Would you write this down as I dictate? Sorry, Professor. No time. Yeah, yeah. Well, what the hell? Yeah. Twenty minutes till eight. Where are we headed? Hold on. Hold on. I'll tell you in a minute. Here. Let me see that page again. Where did you get that paper? We borrowed it. ""From Santi's earthly tomb, the demon's hole..."" Are you insane? ""...across Rome the mystic elements unfold."" ""The path of light is laid in a sacred test."" ""Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest."" You removed a document from the Vatican archives? She did. ""From Santi's earthly tomb..."" - The first marker is at Santi's tomb. - Yeah. - But who's Santi? - Raphael. - Raphael? The sculptor? - Yeah. Santi was his last name. - So, the path starts at Raphael's tomb? - Raphael's buried at the Pantheon. - Isn't the Pantheon a church? - The oldest Catholic church in Rome. I just pulled a dozen of my best men for this. You better be right. This is one of the busiest spot in all of Rome. You can never get away with it. It's impossible. The poem implies-- The poem? Unbelievable. I'm basing this operation on an American's interpretation of a 400 year old poem. Well, the information we have clearly refers to Raphael's tomb and Raphael's tomb is inside that building. And because the Vatican destroyed all of the pagan statues in the late 1800s, if this is the first marker, whatever clues were here to lead us to the next are sure gone by now. The path is dead. So, this is it. Your only chance. Seperate approaches. No closer than two blocks and no uniforms. Three minutes. I'll need a set of eyes inside. Excuse me. Two men with symmetric black suits and earpieces? They're hardly disguised. That's what I have. - Well, fine. I'll go in. You don't have communication. You can't carry a walkie talkie. It's too conspicuous. Tourists have cell phones, don't they? No, no. You can't send her in there alone. All right. I won't. Don't look so anxious. We're supposed to be married. Well, maybe we're not getting along today, hmm? Hold my hand. - But don't crush it. - Sorry. Nervous newlywed. Ooh. Look, honey. The oculus. That could be the demon's hole in the poem. Why are the tombs at an angle? They're facing east to worship the rising sun. But this is a Christian church. New religions often adopt the existing customs and holidays to make conversion less of a shock. Like the 25th of December. It's the pagan celebration of the unconquered sun. It also makes a handy date for the birth of Christ. - Let's check the recesses. - Okay. I'll go to the right and I'll meet you in 180 degrees. Follow me, please. Now, the Pantheon, which means 'Temple of all Gods', was originally built as a temple to all the gods of ancient Rome in 27 BC. Although the building is usually credited to Agrippa of Damascus... Robert! Robert! It's Raphael's tomb, but it's the wrong one. What are you talking about? It was moved here in 1759, a century after Diagramma was published. Where was he originally buried? Urbino, I think. Santi's earthly tomb. What could posssibly be Santi's earthly tomb? Damn it! Santi's tomb. It must mean the chapel that he built. He's not buried in it. He designed it. The demon's hole. It's not that oculus. It's an undercroft. It's a crypt. Are there any questions? Yes. Yes! Did Raphael Santi ever design a chapel with an ossuary anex in an angel figure commissioned by the Catholic church? I'm sorry. I can only think of one. One is good. Wrong? What do you mean wrong? It's the Chigi chapel in the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo. It was once called Capella della Terra, the Chapel of the Earth. Earth. The first element. That's it. - You're certain about the Pantheon? - We have four minutes. Back to the Vatican. Back to the Vatican? You-You can't. Commandante, if you care at all about your church, you'll listen to me. My church? My church comforts the sick and dying. My church feeds the hungry. What does your church do, Mr. Langdon? That's right. You don't have one. Take him if you want. I'm done with him. All right, this makes sense. Look, look, look! Right in front of the church. An obelisk. A lofty pyramid. The Egyptian symbol adopted by the Illuminati. If he's going to kill him, he'll do it here. Eight o'clock. No. No. Here. It's an Annulus. Which one is the Chigi Chapel? Must be in one of these areas. Pyramids in a Catholic church. This is it. This is the Chigi Chapel. The Demon's Hole. Yeah, but it's askew. Come here. Give me your flashlight. What's that? My Savior Christ will be my judge, to testify that my voice is His. For I believe that He should be chosen for the sake of God. I wish to Pontifex, Dominicus Scolamiero. I wish to Pontifex, Eduardo Rossi. They are voting for themselves to prevent a majority. They're waiting for the Preferiti to be rescued. Perhaps we should, as well, yes? Not until the smoke is white will the College of Cardinals have chosen a new Holy Father. For now the Vatican seat of ultimate power remains vacant. Get the body out of there. Search the rest of the building. - Chartrand! - Sir. Outside a perimeter. Secure, but invisible. No lights, no guns. Nobody knows. Understand? Yes, sir. Is it Raphael? The chapel is Raphael. But the sculptures are Bernini. The unknown Illuminati master? Bernini? - He worked for the church. - Almost exclusively. But the Illuminati were infiltrators. There wasn't a powerful organization on earth they didn't penetrate, including the Vatican, by hiding in plain sight. Habakkuk and the Angel. He's the prophet that predicted the annihilation of the earth. ""Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest."" This is the first marker. The path is a line. Southwest. It was pointing southwest. Earth, air, fire, water. We're looking for a Bernini sculpture having something to do with air. The second church is somewhere southwest of here. You're sure this time? I need a map showing all the churches of Rome. I could use it now. The purple layers with these black crosses represent the churches. But nothing intersects the line until it hits... until it hits St. Peter's. Michelangelo designed St. Peter's, not Bernini. Michelangelo designed the Basilica. Bernini designed St. Peter's Square. The second marker must be a statue in St. Peter's Square. It's ten minutes to nine. Can you go any faster? Not unless you want the full attention of the world press. No majority in the first vote, but Cardinal Baggia from Italy is the clear favorite... Still no new Pope, but Cardinal Guidera from Spain has the best chance... The more conceivable candidate could be Cardinal Ebner from Germany... Stem cell research is murder! You condemn sick people to death. Man is not God. There. Another obelisk. Check the crowd. It's almost nine. He's got to be here already. Must be a hundred statues up there. None of them are angels. Those are all saints. How in God's name would anyone create a sculpture about air? Bas relief. Of course. It's still a sculpture. Check the ground. Look at the carvings. Look for another having something to do with air. Vento Ponente. West wind. Vittoria. Here it is. West wind. An angel blowing out five streaks of air. This is it. Call the police! Call an ambulance! He's still alive. His chest. They punctured his lungs. ""And you squeezed the life out of a bishop of Rome."" And he's actually claiming responsibility for the death of His Holiness. That's ridiculous. He died of a stroke. It impliess the Illuminati murdered him with his own medication. What? It's on here. ""With man's solution we stilled his heart."" ""With his own needle did we pierce his unholy vein."" Did the Holy Father take any kind of medication by injection? Tinzaparin. He had thrombophlebitis. He took an injection every day, but no one knew that. Someone knew it. Well, he had health concerns and seizures, as well. But he took steps to make sure he was watched for safety. He didn't want it made public, so we have no reason to discuss it. Tinzaparin is lethal in the wrong dosage. An overdose could cause massive internal bleeding and brain hemorrhages. It might look like a stroke at first, but in few days, his body would show signs. This could easily be examined. Ms. Vetra, in case you're not aware of it... Papal autopsy is prohibited by Vatican law. We're not going to defile his Holiness body just because of these claims. But why would they send this letter now? In order to cause panic. ""The sun will blind at midnight..."" ""and neither police nor professors can stop it."" He knows I'm here. Obviously, they were hoping this letter would become public. We might be wise to preempt their next attempt by making an announcement of our own. - To refute this absurd claim. - That's out of the question. Cardinal Strauss has insisted this entire matter be kept internal. He shouldn't even be aware of it. He's locked in conclave. His final instructions, before sealing the doors, were very clear. Cardinal Strauss does not dictate Vatican protocols. And to say, yet, technically, now that conclave has begun, it is privilege and duty to control public announcements. I've drafted a press release about the incident at the piazza, but any other statements are specifically prohibited. For that, the cardinal has asked me to remind you we have a chimney. Commander Richter, the search for the device? Well, we've turned the power on and off to about twenty percent of Vatican city - but nothing on the video yet. - We're running out of options. How long would you need to evacuate everyone? If I pull all my men from the search for the bomb, thirty minutes. Mr. Langdon, you have been right so far about the path. It's now 9:15. How quickly can you find the next church? The lines of breath on the carving pointed due east directly away from Vatican City. But there were five of them, so there's room for error. About twenty churches intersect those lines. None of them have names that invoke fire. So, the Bernini sculpture must be inside one of them that does. I'm willing to get back into the archives to find it. - Would you escort Mr Langdon? - Yes, Father. Silvano's journals. The killer's name could be in here. - May I stay? - Please. Fine. Of course. Professor. Would it surprise you to find those clothes suit you? It would surprise the hell out of me. The Vatican expressed its sympathy with the families of the victim. A tourist from Dsseldorf, whose death is confirmed. Vatican police have arrested a suspect... The investigation is completed. Vatican will permit access to St. Peter's again, with strict security measures. The Vatican did admit that, where there are crowds, so often follows crime. We're trying now to get the name of the tourist who was... But wait. We're getting word now of smoke. Smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney. Apparently, there's been another vote. The smoke is black. Once again, the Cardinals have failed to reach consensus, and the Catholic Church remains without a leader. What are you looking for now? - Church assets. - I beg your pardon? Artwork. It's valuable. Corporations tend to keep track of their holdings. The Catholic church is not a corporation. It's a beacon. A source of inspiration for one billion lost and frightened souls. Sure, I get that. It's also a bank. Commander Olivetti said that I was not to leave your side this time. It wasn't me. It was her. Power in zone 3 is disabled. No response on the screen. Power on zone 3 again and continue with zone 4. What sort of signs? I'm sorry? If the Holy Father was given an overdose of Tinzaparin, what signs would his body bear? Bleeding of the oral mucosa. His tongue. Post-mortem, the blood congeals, then turns the inside of the mouth black. Even after fourteen days? It wouldn't show up until at least a week after his death. He was very important to me. Yeah, I understand. Will you come with me, please? Signore, would you organize a security team to escort Ms. Vetra and myself down to the crypt? Yes, sir. We'll leave immediately. Do you smoke? A little bit. You better sit down before you keel over. What does this say in Italian? Ecstasy of Saint Theresa. Right there. Moved at suggestion of the artist. Moved? To another church? At the suggestion of Bernini? I don't know. Here. Translate all of this for me, and I'll buy you a pack of smokes. I'm looking for a reference of fire. - Seraphim, meaning ""the fiery one"". - Right. His great golden spear. A point of fire. Then ""woman left completely afire."" The ecstasy of Saint Theresa. Saint Theresa on fire. So, this sculpture was moved to this church? Why are they shuting down the system? They know we're down here. If there's no power, there's no oxygen. - Can we get out? - The door is electronic. Well, that's disappointing. - Where are we going? - To see my father. I don't understand. I was orphaned when I was nine years of age. A bombing in Ulster, the UVF protesting the visit of a Catholic Archbishop. The Archbishop felt responsible and he adopted me the following day. I was raised by him and by the Church. He was the wisest man I ever met. Even when I was young and stubborn, I wanted to be ordained, but I was brought up in Italy so I also wanted to do my military service. I wanted to fight. He told me, ""Learn to fly."" So, I joined the Aeronautica Militari. Flew helicopters. Bringing the wounded back to hospitals. - He was a great man. - Your father died. Fourteen days ago. Headquarters, you hear me? The flow is completed. Oxygen level is very low. - Answer, please. Anybody hear me? - Did you get anything? No. The walls are lead lined. There's no signal. This way. If the Holy Father was murdered, the implications are profound. Vatican security is impenetrable. No one from the outside could've got anywhere near him. It was someone on the inside. We can trust no one. On my screen, no response in zone 7. We rechon that the battery will soon be empty and the device will explode shortly before midnight. Holy Father... when I was young, you've told me the voice in my heart was God's voice. You said I should follow it no matter how painful. Forgive me. Please, give me strength. What I do, I do in the name of everything you believed. God help us. Santa Maria della Vittoria. Do you know it? - Yes, I do. - It's the next church. I think someone just tried to kill me. Professor, I promise you, we had no idea. - He knows I'm here? - Yes. You heard me ask permission. You gave me an escort. Yes, but we had no idea that portions of our white zones were crosswired with that building. Commander Richter was extending the search. If he had known the archives were on that grid, he never would have killed the power. But there is the other possibility. Is it conceivable the Illuminati... have infiltrated the Swiss Guard? Perhaps. The journals. Where are they? Who took the journals from this desk? Signore, this is unacceptable. For a Camerlengo to enter the chapel once conclave has begun. Forgive me. There's been a development. His Holiness Celestine was murdered! Is it so inconceivable that it will happen again? Signori, please, a moment. Please. Signori. Our church is at war. We are under attack from an old enemy. The Illuminati. They have struck us from within. Murdering our Holy Father! And threatening us all with destruction at the hands of their new God 'Science'. They call it retribution. They think it justified... because of the Church's attacks on men of science in the distant past and it's true. Since the days of Galileo, this church has tried to slow the relentless march of progress. Sometimes with misguided means. But science and religion are not enemies. There are simply some things that science is just too young to understand. So the Church pleads, ""Stop."" ""Slow down."" ""Think. Wait."" And, for this, they call us backwards. But who is more ignorant? The man who cannot define lightning... or the man who does not respect its natural awesome power? The battle is well under way, signori. We must defend ourselves. But, what if this time, we fight their stealth with openness? Combat their wicked scheme with simple truth. And end this brutish battle once and for all. If the outside world could see this church as I do, looking beyond the ritual of these walls, they would see a modern miracle. A brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls... who want nothing more than to be voices of compassion in a world spinning out of control. Signori, I ask.. I pray... that you break this conclave. Open the doors, evacuate St. Peter's Square and tell the world the truth. Get him down. There. There, that chain. On that pulley. This bench. Get this pew off here and make it a ladder. Vatican Police. My son... God answers all prayers, but... sometimes His answer is no. The College will not break conclave. May I suggest... you direct your energies to helping the Swiss Guard find this explosive device. If it exists. And leave Church leadership... to its leaders. Eminence. There is a growing fear that without the four Preferiti it defers much authority for any candidate. It will not be possible, - unless... - Speak plainly. It is the recommendation of many that you asked to be removed... from your post as Great Elector. Thereby making yourself eligible to wear the Ring of the Fisherman. Well, if it is God's will. May His will be done. Here! I hear someone. Remove the lid. Come on. Signore, are you okay? I know he is there. Madam, it is necessary that you remain quiet. Don't tell me that I should remain calm. I want to know what he will do. Commander, here's Ms. Vetra. Those journals are private property. I demand that you return them to me. They're material evidence in a Vatican investigation. I am an Italian citizen. My rights do not end just because I crossed the other side. This is not Italy. It's not even Rome. It's the Vatican. A country with its own laws. And when those journals passed the border, they became my property. I will give them back to you when I've decided they contain nothing of value to the investigation. Do you have something to hide, Commandante Richter? Do you, Dr. Vetra? If it were up to me, it wouldn't be this way. It's a sin to kill with pain. It's a sin to kill without reason, Father. They made me a sinner. Saint Theresa on fire. Professor Langdon? - What direction is that? - West, I think. ""Across Rome the mystic elements unfold."" Piazza Barba Rini is here. Saint Theresa is here. Where is the Santa Maria del Popolo, the first altar of science? - Santa Maria del Popolo? - Yes. Thank you. St. Peter's is here. We are here. A church with water. Wait. Wait, wait. Across Rome. The poem must mean it's literally across Rome. Professor Langdon. Commander Richter has ordered me to escort you to the Vatican immediately. Piazza Navona. Earth. Air. Fire. Water. ""A-Cross"" Rome. Bernini's Four Rivers. Professor Langdon, the Vatican insists that I have to take you back immediately. The Vatican is about to see its fourth cardinal murdered tonight. Now, look. You can do as they say and force me back to the Vatican, where we can all mourn his death together. Or you can show me how real cops act and take me to Piazza Navona, where we still might be able to stop it. Oh. By all means, let's talk it over. In fourteen minutes, he's going to be dead. Okay. This way, Professor. Yes, Padre? At 11:15, if the church is still in peril, give the order to evacuate the cardinals. But with dignity. Let them walk out into St. Peter's Square with their heads held high. We don't want the last image of this church to be of frightened old men sneaking out the back door. ""Where the angels guide thee..."" There it is. There it is. Professor, I know this fountain. There is no angel. The dove. The angel of peace. And it's looking in what direction? Uh... east, I think. Professor, just wait here. Stay put. Good evening. Can you help me? I need a doctor. Come here. Calm down. Don't shoot. Hey! Help! Somebody help! Help! Somebody! Cardinal Baja. Cardinal Baja. Si? Where was he hiding you? The Church of Illumination. Where is it? Castel Sant'Angelo. Castle of the Angel. Sir, there's news about Cardinal Baja. The cardinal told Langdon he was being held in Castel Sant'Angelo. If Langdon's right, that's where the bomb is. - Send everyone we can spare. - And you? I'm staying here. Vittoria. - You're all right? - I'm all right, yes. What about you? I just heard about Olivetti on the radio. I'm all right. I'm okay. Robert, we can't trust Richter. He took Silvano's journals. There must be something in there he doesn't want us to see. The head of the Swiss Guard. From the Castel Sant'Angelo. It's close enough so the wireless signal from that camera could still reach the Vatican. The Church of Illumination is somewhere here and your canister is inside it. Come with me. For 400 years, the Illuminati met right under the Church's nose. The Vatican used this as a hideout and as a prison for their enemies. If the explosion happens here, would the blast radius take out the Vatican? And part of Rome along with it. They're pointing to it. The angels. The container must be down there. Come on! - Where are they going? - Back to search the other castle. No, no. It has to be here! Robert, it's a dead end. No, it's not. See if you can find a flashlight. All of these stones are rectangular granite. Except right here. What is this? It's a pentagram. An eye... that leads to... Nowhere. Robert? These walls overlap and there's a passageway in here. Here. Let me have the flashlight. It's a passageway that leads to the Vatican. An ancient escape route. Oh, God. Here. Look. Get on the radio. Get the word out. Conclave remains sealed. The Camerlengo gave the order for evacuation at-- I'm counter-manning it. This is it. This is their church. The canister should be lit by artificial light. It's not here, Robert. ""The shining star at the end of the path."" It has to be. It's not here. What's the poem say? - Nothing. Nothing. It's all over. There was just four lines, each one describing... There's a fifth brand. It's not an ambigram. It's just two crossed keys. - The symbol for the Vatican. - No. No, the papacy. They intend to kill him. Before they destroy the Vatican, they're going to brand and kill the pope himself. There is no pope. ""Tempo Sede Vacante."" The Camerlengo. - We have to warn him. - Take a step back, please. Take your cell phone from your pocket. Throw it in the fire. Murderer. You know, when they call me, and they all call me, it is so important to them that I know that what they ask is the Lord's will. Or Allah's. Or Yahweh's. And I suppose they're right. Because if he was not vengeful, I would not exist, now, would I? I've had several chances to eliminate you tonight. You're still alive because you have no weapon. And they didn't ask me to kill you. But if you pursue me, it is another matter. Be careful. These are men of God. The Camerlengo. Have you come to make me a martyr? Here. Here. - I need to see the Camerlengo. - He is not available. - I demand to see the Camerlengo! - He is not available. We'll see about that. Oh. It's a chiusa chiave. It's a one way portal. The only entrance is on the other side. No. Hey! Help! This is Robert Langdon and Dr. Vetra. Open the door. The Camerlengo is in danger. He's the one. He's got a gun. - Illuminatus! - You bastard. Illuminatus! You bastard! Padre? Order the evacuation. We only have nineteen minutes. Here. He's... And get the helicopter for the older cardinals, right? Yes, sir. Robert? The brand, the symbol. Could it have another meaning? Crossed keys, but those were upside down. St. Peter. The first pope... ...was crucified upside down. - On Vatican Hill. - A few hundred feet below us. - Necropolis. City of the dead. ""Upon this rock, I will build my church."" ""Or bring it down upon itself."" The bomb. It's in St. Peter's tomb. The grid is still cycling. The power to this section must be down. It must be here. It must be. Don't touch it. We have seven minutes. Robert, hold this. It's cold down here, isn't it? What's wrong? Cold decreases battery life. - We may have less than five minutes. - So? If I pull the power with less than five minutes... the residual charge won't hold suspension. We should leave it here and get clear if we can. At least down here the damage-- No! - No. Wait! - Father! We are live here at St. Peter's Square... where, despite a bomb threat, and an orderly evacuation, the crowd is actually growing in size. As we await an official announcement from the Vatican spokesman as to the exact nature of the threat and whether or not they are treating it as a credible danger... This way! He's got a bomb with him. A bomb? Roberto, this is an emergency. I'll take her up alone. He's got clearance. Oh, my God. Get down! Cardinal Strauss? It was the Camerlengo. He has saved us all. He has saved the Church and he's still alive. Praise God. Praise God. He is alive. He sacrificed himself for all of us. You know the worst thing we thought would happen was that our work would fall into the hands of the energy companies. We thought we could change the world. - So naive. - No, not naive. Innocent, maybe. But it's not a crime. I'm not so sure. Go back to work. Change the world. A gift, uh, you understand? Let's say for Catholics everywhere. The Carmelengo's age shouldn't influence the decision. Signori, you are no doubt aware that by Holy Law the man is inelligible for election to the papacy. He's not a cardinal. He's a priest. He's of insufficient age. Or maybe there's a way we could consider the possibility. I am sorry. The protocols of conclave are not subject to modification. I will not call a ballot on this matter. But, signore, you would not hold a ballot. Surely, you remember? You gave up your post as Great Elector. They are singing at St. Peter's Square. Now, what happened here tonight transcends our laws. Has it? Is it God's will that we give ourselves over to frenzy? Discard the rules of the Church? Perhaps we need not discard them. Signori, I am thinking now of Romano Pontifici Eligendo numero 60... - Acclamation by Adoration. - Exactly, signore. Exactly. Yes. If the Holy Spirit speaks through us, and we call a man's name out loud... That is election by adoration. - Yes. - He's God's choice. Yes. And the candidate need only be an ordained member of the clergy, present in the Sistine Chapel at the moment of his election. - Signor Camerlengo? - Yes? The cardinals ask you to join them in conclave as soon as possible. - Me? - Yes, Padre. What are you doing? Silvano's journals. I want them back. Richter said... His Holiness suffered from seizures and steps were taken... for safety. He made sure he was watched, he said. What if he were trying to give me this key? That's the Papal office. If the Pope was worried about seizures, he must've had Richter install cameras without telling anyone. To keep an eye on him for his safety. Maybe it records. - I read the journals, Patrick. - The scientist kept journals. So? - You figure prominently in them. - Really? The Devoli wasn't just a physicist. He was also a Catholic priest. As such, he was deeply conflicted about the implications of his work and in need of spiritual guidance. Like Galileo. About a month ago, he requested an audience with the Pope. But you know that, cause you granted the audience and you were also present during it. The 'God Particle'. To actually claim an act of creation. - The blasphemy. The arrogance. - The Holy Father didn't see it like that. He urged him to go public. His Holiness thought that the discovery could actually scientifically prove the existence of a divine power. And begin to bridge the gap between science and religion. His work was not religious. It was sacrilegious. But you... You saw the pope's position as a softening of church law. As an old man's weakness. Your father's weakness. You murdered the Vicar of Christ. He raised me to protect this Church, even from within. Then you conjured up an old enemy from the past. The Illuminati. You found the ancient brands in the papal vaults and put them to use to spread fear! The Cardinals are men of belief. Right now, their belief in evil is uniting them. The entire Catholic world will be united by this attack. There is no attack. You're trying to convince the Cardinals they're in a war, so they will choose a warrior to lead them. We are at war. We're weak when we should be strong. If science is allowed to claim the power of creation, what is left for God? It didn't work, Patrick. - It isn't finished. - Oh yes, it's finished. It's finished. I've shown the journals to Father Simeon. The moment the doors to the Conclave open, he will tell the Cardinals what you've done. I was planning on doing this alone. Put it down. But, perhaps, it's better that you're here. Put it down. Put it away. Help. He's the one. He's got a gun. - Illuminatus! - You bastard. Illuminatus! You bastard! Padre. And get the helicopter for the older cardinals, right? I've been summoned by the College of Cardinals. Gently. But within our walls. He's on your side. Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. Church sources now confirm that Carmelengo, Father Patrick McKenna, has died of internal injuries sustained in his heroic fall... The Catholic church thanks Camerlengo for his selfless act and demands his immediate canonization. The Vatican has also confirmed the deaths of three Cardinals and the fire in the Santa Maria della Vittoria. As we await the appearance of the new Holy Father Cardinal Baggia of Italy, one of the four original Preferiti, who, despite terrorist attempts at disruption seems to have been selected in one of the swiftest and smoothest conclaves in modern church history. Professor Langdon? Please. A token of thanks from His Holiness and from his new Camerlengo. We are grateful you saved his life. And it's our understanding that you require this text to complete your scholary work. We ask only that in your last grand testament you ensure it finds its way home. Of course. And when you write of us, and you will write of us, may I ask one thing? Do so gently. I'll try. Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed. All men, including this one. He chose the name Luke. There's been many Marks and Johns. Never a Luke. It said he was a doctor. It's quite a message. Science and faith, all in one. The world is in need of both. You'll counsel him wisely. I'm an old man. I'll counsel him briefly. Mr. Langdon. Thanks be to God for sending someone to protect this church. I don't believe He sent me, Father. Oh, my son. Of course He did. subtitle made by rakib00, atheeshkr, lockjaw and rogard. Nice teamwork, guys., Where are they? I don't know. Dad! Uncle Merrill! Dad! Morgan! Bo? Bo? Bo, where's Morgan? Bo? Are you in my dream, too? - This is not a dr... - Dad! Hey... Honey... Morgan? What's happening? The dogs were barking... woke us up. Are you hurt? I think God did it. Did what, Morgan? Look, Lee, I don't even care if it was him. And you can just have a word with him, and that'd be enough for me. See, it was strange finding the crops that way. The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it'd sure take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that's all. At the movies? Are you sure? All right, then. Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee. Yeah. Bye. Houdini peed. I think he's sick. Why don't you take him outside? I'll call Dr. Crawford. He doesn't treat animals. Well, he'll know what to do. Oh. That was quick, Caroline. I only called you folks two hours ago. Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards. She went down to Thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards. Spitting! By the time I got there, Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place. And she must have had a cold or something. I'm telling you, I won't eat for a week. So, what happened to your crops? Dad's gonna burn these again. It's contaminated. You don't even know what that word means. It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl. It tastes funny. It does not. And besides, he licks his butt every day. I don't think he'll mind. Houdini? Bo, don't run. What's wrong, boy? Stop it, Houdini. Look at where it's bent over, Father. It's not broken. Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it? Can't be by hand. It's too perfect. It doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers. They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants. I don't think anyone else around here has had any problems. I was over at Theo Henry's farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something. Why were you at Theo's place? Some animals around the county have been acting funny... and some of them violent. What is it, a virus? I don't think so, Father. They're more edgy, you know, and alert. It's almost like they act when they smell a predator around... peeing on themselves and everything. Caroline... please stop calling me ""Father."" What's wrong? I don't hear my children. He fell on me. He wanted to kill Bo. Did he hurt you? No. I'm so sorry, Morgan. Where were you? Houdini's sick. Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sure the knot's very tight. What's the matter? There's a monster outside my room. Can I have a glass of water? What's wrong with the water next to your bed? It tastes old. What are you thinking about? Why do you talk to Mom when you're by yourself? Makes me feel better. Does she ever answer back? No. She never answers me either. What? Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back. It's time for an ass-whupping. This is not an intelligent way to approach this. Lee is a friend of mine. This is his son. Yeah, we'll be doing Lee a favor. All right, listen... we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions. We act crazy, insane with anger... make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side. Explain ""act crazy."" You know, curse and stuff. You want me to curse? You don't mean it. It's just for show. What? Well, it won't be convincing. It doesn't sound natural when I curse. Just make noises, then. Explain ""noises."" Are you gonna do this or what? No, I'm not. All right, you want them stealing something in the house next time? On the count of three... - All right. Aaah! I'm insane with anger! We're gonna beat your ass, bitch! We're gonna tear your head off! I'm losing my mind! It's time for an ass-whupping! I cursed. I heard. How did he get... Are you sure this is Lionel Prichard? You like that? You got an old baby monitor around? Bo had an old baby monitor. You can use Bo's baby monitor as a walkie-talkie. - You can? - Mm-hmm. It only works one way, but that'll do fine. That is, until someone gets you an old walkie-talkie left over at the station. Stop! It's hideous! Get it off! I-I know what to do. Hey, Bo... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves. Doy-da! You're too old to still be doing this. You take a glass of water, and you finish it. Now, what's wrong with this one? It has dust in it. This one? A hair. This one? Morgan took a sip, and it has his amebas in it. My turn. So, how are you, Merrill? Fine. How is work at the gas station? Stimulating. I never got a chance to tell you, but I-I thought your moving in here with your brother after... it was a nice thing to do. Well, I don't think I'm helping much. You are. Sorry. Okay, so far I have, ""It was very dark."" Yes, it was. You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's kind of odd? A little. I don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget. No, he definitely wasn't a midget. Okay. So he was tall? I-I would say so, yes. Probably. Over 6 feet? It was very dark. Yes, it was. How certain are you that this was a male? Oh, I don't know... I don't know any girls who could run like that. I don't know, Merrill. I've seen some of those women on the Olympics. They can run like the wind. This guy got on our roof in, like, a second. O-Our roof is 10 feet high. They have women's high jumping in the Olympics. They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me. Caroline, I know you're making a point here, but I just don't know what it is. An out-of-town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine. She scared a couple of the customers. No one's seen her since. And my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available. Dad, where's the remote? I don't know, baby. Why don't you check in the sofa cushions? Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility? I'm not done asking questions, and I don't appreciate sarcasm. Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you... maybe a-a church member who... who might not have liked the fact that you left the church? I don't think so. Okay, I was out of line with the whole female- Scandinavian-Olympian thing. It's just, I'm pretty strong, and I'm pretty fast. And I was running as fast as I could, and this guy, he was... he was just toying with us. There's only food under the sofa. Baby, why don't you just change the channel on the television? I did. And? Same show's on every station. Every station? Bo, turn up the volume. Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life. They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes. This new resurgence is wholly different. The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries. There are only a limited number of explanations. Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... it's for real. Extraterrestrials. What in God's name is going on? I did some research after I saw your crops. Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes. Really? That's how these things have been done in the past. But there are so many now. How could so many people be in on it? I can't think straight. I'm... I'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar's coffee and... and try to think clear. And after that, I'll... I might make some calls. But I'll tell you something... what I said in there, it still goes. Your... your family has been through a lot. And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm? Good medicine. That's good advice. And you take care of yourself... Graham. The footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34-year-old local cameraman in Bangalore, a southern city of India. It's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours. Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio? They are signs intended to be seen from the sky... No radio either. Just for a while. Book money? Sure. Just one. Be back for pizza in 15. It's just a bunch of crock. They're trying to sell sodas. It's plain and simple. Been watching these reports since morning. I have seen 12 soda commercials so far... You have any books on extraterrestrials? Now, don't tell me you believe this horse manure. As a matter of fact, I think we have one. Came by mistake in a shipment... decided to keep it for the city people. Last row, third book on the left, honey. Why is no one saying the obvious? These are just copycats. Someone somewhere does the first one... It was asthma medicine, right, Father? For Morgan Hess. And it's not ""Father"" anymore. In less than an hour, a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea, and here we are, on the verge of mass hysteria. Can I ask you a favor, Father? I need to clear my conscience. Will you listen to me? Tracey... I am not a reverend anymore. I haven't been for six months. You know this. All this stuff on TV... two girls came in here talking about the end of the world... I'm just a little scared. Please, I need to clear my conscience. I've got it figured. You do? I've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights. Can't tell what they look like 'cause they're staying in the shadows... covert like. Nobody's been hurt, mind you. And that's the giveaway. I see. It's called ""probing."" It's a military procedure. You send out a reconnaissance group... very small... to check things out. Not to engage but to evaluate the situation... evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear. Clear for what? For the rest of them. Yeah? You got a pamphlet or something I can read? Sure. Thanks. You didn't used to play baseball, did ya? Shit, I know you. You're Merrill Hess. I was there the day you hit that 507-footer over the left-field wall... set the record. Man, that thing had a motor on it. It's still the record, right? Got the bat at home o-on the wall. You've got two minor-league home-run records, don't ya? Five. Why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women? 'Cause he has another record most people don't know about. He has the minor-league strikeout record. Hello, Lionel. Merrill's a class-A screw-up. He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time. Didn't matter what the coaches said, didn't matter who was on base. He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could. Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree. Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players. You really got the strikeout record? Felt wrong not to swing. It's contaminated. Carl, there's something wrong with our water. Your water's fine. Bo has this thing about her drinking water. She had it her whole life. It's like a tick people have, except it's not a tick. Is that right? ## Don't give me that so-so-soda ## ## That same old cola ## ## I wanna pop ## - ## Pop, pop I wanna... Shasta ## - I'll take it. I cursed 37 times last week. I said the ""F"" word a couple times, but mostly...""shits"" and...""bastards."" Is ""douche bag"" a curse? I suppose that would depend on its usage. How about, ""John, you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara""? It's a curse. Then it's not 37. It's 71. Pharmacy crowded? I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood? Is that him? Yeah. Who is he? What is it? It's Bo's baby monitor. I found it in the basement. I'm gonna use it as a walkie-talkie. What if it's catching a signal from them? It's not. But it wasn't working. Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives. They're, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in. They do stupid crap like this to feel special. It's a scam. Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds are doing it again. It's just static, Morgan, all right. Turn it up. See. It's a code. Why can't they get girlfriends? Can I see that, please? It's noise. It's broken, Morgan. It's just gonna keep doing this. Maybe some new batteries... We might lose the signal. This is exactly what the nerds want. I'm getting out now. Nobody move. Voices. Did you hear that? Not English, though. You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill? I heard them, Morgan. Probably picking up another baby monitor. That's right. Let me see it. Stop! See, this is why we're not watching TV. People get obsessed. I'm letting go now. No, Dad! Don't do it! You'll lose the signal. Don't let go. It gets clearer the higher you hold it. I got it. Bo, honey, I don't want you climbing on the car. Come here. Stop! There's two of them talking. Isabel, you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make-believe. You're wasting your time here! I'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody! You're not going to get famous! Okay. Let's turn on the TV. It first appeared 52 minutes ago. Mexico City officials as well as U. S. Officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force. The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatln to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space. They were not detected by radar by either country. The nerds were right. We have to tape this. My ballet recital. Listen, Bo, this is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there. For your children, Bo. My ballet recital. Dad! Find another tape. Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape. You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City. This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way. What you're seeing is real. It's unbelievable. Everything they wrote in science books is about to change. I told you. Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world. That's true. Do you think it could be? Yes. How can you say that? That wasn't the answer you wanted? Couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort. People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky. Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence. They see it as a sign... evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them. Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance. I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way. For them, the situation isn't 50-50. Could be bad, could be good. But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own. And that fills them with fear. Yeah, there are those people. But there's a whole lot of people in the group number one. When they see those 14 lights, they're looking at a miracle. And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there'll be someone there to help them. And that fills them with hope. See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you? Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles? Or do you believe that people just get lucky? Or look at the question this way... is it possible that there are no coincidences? I was at this party once. I'm on the couch with Randa McKinney. She was just sitting there looking beautiful, staring at me. I go to lean in and kiss her... and I realize I have gum in my mouth. So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around. Randa McKinney throws up all over herself. I knew the second it happened it was a miracle. I could have been kissing her when she threw up. That would have scarred me for life. I may never have recovered. I'm a miracle man. Those lights are a miracle. There you go. So, which type are you? Do you feel comforted? Yeah, I do. Then what does it matter? I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die. She said, ""See."" Then her eyes glazed a bit. And then she said, ""Swing away."" You know why she said that? Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head. There is no one watching out for us, Merrill. We are all on our own. What do you know? Well, there was an accident... drunk driving, they weren't sure... He wasn't drunk. Ray fell asleep at the wheel. - Is he okay? - Yeah. That was the first thing Colleen asked, too. She's talking. What ambulance is she in? She's not in an ambulance, Father. For the kids' protection. All they were doing was watching TV from 5:00 a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something. What's furry, furry rabbit? It's a game, isn't it? Anyways, they closed the schools. And there's been some interesting developments. What time is it? They're gone, but they're not really gone. We just can't see them. Early this morning, a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night. It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down. They caught it on tape. They've been playing it all morning. The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky. They found the bird. His... his head was crushed in. They think they have some kind of invisible-shield thing going, l-like an optical illusion. They're still there, hovering. Some people think there's more of them now... All over the place, over us, even. There's a theory about the c... the crop circles. They could be some kind of... some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate... makes sense. Want to hear a story? Is it true? So the aliens can't read our minds. Oh. Oh, of course. They tell you everything in this book. It says they're probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development. It also says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet. Who wrote this book? Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs. That means they're unemployed. If you're gonna make fun of it, then forget it. This is serious. I don't know what got into me. There are pictures. Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book... - Bimbu? - Dad. I just asked his name. You had a tone. He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us... to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason... they're hostile. They've used up all the resources on their planet, and they're looking to harvest our planet next. Here. Looks a little like our house, doesn't it? Same windows. That's weird. Yeah, oh, yeah. That's enough from Dr. Bimbu for now. Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something. Hello? Father? Hello? Hello?! I'm going out for a few minutes. No one leaves this house... no one. Where you going? Ray Reddy's house. Why? I think he just called here. You don't think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan? Why? You have one of your feelings again? Is it bad? I won't let anything bad happen to you. I don't want you to die. Who said I was gonna die? Who said I was gonna die? Hello, Ray. What happened? I wrote your number down to call you. It's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months. When I knew it was inside the house... I couldn't think of any other number to call. I panicked. Thank you for coming, Father. You're welcome, Ray. I worked so long that night. I've never fallen asleep driving before... never since. Don't. Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car in sight in either direction. If I'd have fallen asleep then, I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache. And it had to be at that right moment... that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking. It was like it was meant to be. I guess if this is the end of the world, I'm screwed, right? People who kill reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven. Wh... Where are you going, Ray? To the lake. The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such... none of them are really near water. I don't think they like water. Can't be any worse than here. Did you see something, Ray? I know what I've done to you. I made you question your faith. I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours. All right. And don't open my pantry, Father. I found one of them in there and locked him in. The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a 42-year-old, Romero Valadarez. This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil. It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago. All initial opinions are this is genuine. What you're about to see may disturb you. Move, children! Vmanos! Oh! Hello? The police are here. I am with them. I am a police officer. I just want to talk with you. We know all about the hoax. We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon. Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others. Don't throw your life away, son. Oh! Ah! Oh! Their skin changes colors. That's why we couldn't see them that night. Tell me something, Morgan. Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile? Yes. It said they would probably invade. They would use ground tactics... hand-to-hand combat. They wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle 'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons. Then the planet would be useless to them. How could anyone possibly know that information? It's ridiculous. What else did it say? They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion. One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later. What's two? They win. I'm sorry, what... what book is this? Is this really happening? I heard a theory that, uh, they don't like places near water. Maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake or something. Sounds made-up. I saw one of them at Ray Reddy's house. I can't be sure, but I got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me. So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out. We might be overreacting, but I'm willing to live with that. Either way, at least we'll be together. All those in favor of the lake idea, raise your hand. Yeah. All those in favor of home, raise your hand. Okay. My vote counts as two. That's bullshit! You're cheating! Morgan, calm down. I get two votes because I represent two parents here. We don't know anything yet. We'll be safe here anyway. I don't want to leave home. This is where we lived with Mom. That's got nothing to do with this. I change my vote. You can't change your vote. All those in favor of home, raise your hand. This is ridiculous. You lose, 3-2. We're going to board up every window in this house. How do we know boards will do anything? Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors. The information we're receiving comes from our affiliates across the world. Dad, Uncle Merrill! Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights. There are lights in over 274 cities. They think it'll be 400 within the hour. They're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs. They were for navigation. They made a map. They're gonna be within a mile of us. Dad? Yes? They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack maneuver. I was wrong. They're hostile. It's like ""War of the Worlds."" Ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe. Hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches. God be with us all. I'm going to get back to the windows. Hey, you guys okay? Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world. Don't worry. You won't let anything happen to us, right? No way. I wish you were my dad. What did you say? Don't you ever say anything like that again. Ever. There's too many windows in the bedrooms. We don't have enough boards. We'll board up the bedroom doors. Where are we gonna sleep? In the family room. What about Isabel? We'll tie her up in the garage after dinner. I'll make some sandwiches. I want spaghetti. We'll just eat fast, Bo. Spaghetti sounds great. What do you want, Morgan? Anything? French toast... and mashed potatoes. Now we're talking. How about you, Merrill? Chicken teriyaki. Good choice. I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon. Extra bacon. What's the matter with everyone? Eat. Maybe we should say a prayer. No. Why not? We're not saying a prayer. Bo has a bad feeling. I had a dream. We aren't saying a prayer. Eat! I hate you. That's fine. You let Mom die. Morgan. I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer. Not one more minute. Understood? Now we are going to enjoy this meal. No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it! Stop crying! - Graham... - Don't yell at her! All right, since you're all not gonna eat. I'm gonna try some of everything. It's happening. Graham, hurry. Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo? You came out of your mama, and you didn't even cry. You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody. Your eyes were so big and gorgeous. All the ladies in the room just gasped. I mean, they literally gasped. And they go, ""Oh, she's like an angel."" And they said, ""We've never seen a baby so beautiful."" And then... you know what happened? They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled. They say babies that young can't smile. You smiled. Let's go down now. We forgot Isabel. Should we turn off the lights? They already know we're here. Dad... Do you know what happened when you were born, Morgan? You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you. They're on the roof. While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you. They're in the house. I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamed about you her whole life. Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time. And then she said real soft, ""Hello, Morgan. I'm your mama. You look just how I dreamed."" The attic door. Let's go. Come on. We forgot our foil helmets. Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob? They'll read our minds. You're scaring your sister. I'm already scared. Merrill. I'm looking! They'll know our secret thoughts. I'm not ready. Merrill! Got it! Dad! Where's Bo? I'm okay. What's happening out there? I can't even imagine. I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets. They're only making noises. They're not trying to get in. Why would they do that? They want our attention on the door? They're distracting us. From what? The book says they're probably very good problem solvers. They'll find a way in. Morgan, give me your flashlight. They used to pour coal down in this basement. There's a coal chute in here. I can feel air. Me too! It's getting stronger. I'm close. What? Hold him! I got him! Hold him! I got him! Hold him! We don't have his medicine. Don't be afraid, Morgan. We'll slow this down together. Feel my chest. Feel it moving in and out. Breathe like me. Breathe like me. Come on. I dreamed this. Stay with me. I know it hurts. Be strong, baby. It'll pass. It'll pass. Don't do this to me again. Not again. I hate you. I hate you. The fear is feeding him. Don't be afraid of what's happening. Believe it's going to pass. Believe it. Just wait. Don't be afraid. The air is coming. Believe. We don't have to be afraid. It's about to pass. Here it comes. Don't be afraid. Here comes the air. Don't be afraid, Morgan. Feel my chest. Breathe with me. Together. The air is going in our lungs. Together. We're the same. We're the same. We should save the flashlights. Ray's truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two. What does that mean... pinned? The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half. What did you say? She won't be saved. Her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive, and the truck is holding her together. And she doesn't feel much, and she's... she's talking almost like normal, and we didn't pull the truck out 'cause we... we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she's awake. And that won't be very long. Now, Father, do you understand what I've told you? Caroline... is this the last time I'm gonna talk with my wife? Yes, it is. People think they came here to take over the planet. That's bull. I don't think that. My friend and I saw them. I found a pack of light bulbs. They poisoned his family. They dragged them away. Nobody believes it, but they didn't come here for our planet. This is a raid. They came here for us, to harvest us. We're lucky as hell they're leaving here. They're leaving? That's what they're saying. How long have we been sleeping? 12 hours or so. He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts. A lot of people died. But they're leaving. They left real fast this morning, like something scared them off. They left some of their wounded behind. Why are they going? People must have figured out a way to beat them. Everyone has a weakness, right? You didn't think we'd make it through the night, did you? No. Listen... there's things I can take and a couple things I can't. One of them I can't take is when my older brother, who's everything I want to be... starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night. I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again. Okay? I'm serious. Okay. He's been like that for a while. He needs his medicine. Have they said anything about our area? Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure? He's not strong enough. If he has another attack right now... I know. We'd have to be sure before we opened up that door, Graham. It's good enough for me. Me too. Get the syringes' well. We may need to give him an epinephrine shot. The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic. - People are celebrating. - They're doing this on TV. There's a great sense of relief. - They're dancing. - Yeah, like this. As we begin evaluating the loss of life, - Do you want to see it? - We will be left with a lot of questions. - I'll bring the TV in here. - I see the same expression on every face. We know the battle turned around in the Middle East. Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them. We have no further details at this time. Merrill, wait. Hi, sweetie. Hi, baby. I was... just taking a walk before dinner. You love walks. It was meant to be. Does it hurt? I don't feel much. Good. Tell Morgan... to play games. It's okay to be silly. I will. Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her. I will. And tell Graham... I'm here. Tell him... see. Tell him to see. And tell Merrill to swing away. See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you? Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles? Or do you believe that people just get lucky? Is it possible... there are no coincidences? Swing away, Merrill. Merrill... swing away. That's why he had asthma. It can't be luck. His lungs were closed. His lungs were closed. No poison got in. No poison got in. His lungs were closed. His lungs were closed. Don't touch him. Give him a minute. Graham... Give him a second. D-Daddy... Don't touch him. Graham... Don't... don't. Dad? What happened? Did someone save me? Yeah, baby, I think someone did., It's time to get out. Don't bleed to death. - Hello, Mitchell. - Bond. The Americans are gonna be none too pleased about this. I promised them Le Chiffre, and they got Le Chiffre. They got his body. If they'd wanted his soul, they should have made a deal with a priest. - Has he said anything? - No. I'm going to check the perimeter, ma'am. You look like hell. When's the last time you slept? Vesper's boyfriend, Yusef Kabira, the one who was abducted in Morocco, the one she was trying to save. His body was washed up on a beach in Ibiza. We're meant to believe the fish did that to his face. His wallet and ID were in his pocket. - Well, that's convenient. - Quite. Which is why I did a DNA check on a lock of his hair found in Vesper's apartment. It's not him. A lock of his hair? I wouldn't have thought Vesper the sentimental type. Well, we never really know anyone, do we? But I do need to know, Bond. I need to know that I can trust you. And you don't? Well, it'd be a pretty cold bastard who didn't want revenge for the death of someone he loved. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not gonna go chasing him. He's not important. And neither was she. It's clear, ma'am. - Thanks, Mitchell. - Shall we? Are you gonna tell us who you work for? I was always very interested to meet you. I'd heard so much about you from Vesper. The real shame is that if she hadn't killed herself, we would have had you, too. I think you would have done anything for her. Well, you know you're not in Britain, and God knows where you'll be tomorrow. Which should tell you that eventually you will tell us about the people you work with, and the longer it takes, the more painful we'll make it. You really don't know anything about us. It's so amusing because we are on the other side, thinking, ""The Ml6, the CIA, they're looking over our shoulders. ""They're listening to our conversations."" And the truth is you don't even know we exist. Well, we do now, Mr. White, and we're quick learners. Oh, really? Well, then, the first thing you should know about us is that we have people everywhere. Am I right? Anything? Craig Mitchell worked for me for eight years. He passed a full security check and lie detector test every year. Didn't leave so much as a scrap of paper to explain any of it. Eight years! Five as my personal bodyguard. I found this and three other bloody Christmas presents I bought him about the house. I don't think he smoked. And you had to kill him. Couldn't bring him in for questioning so that we might actually learn something. When someone says we got people everywhere, you expect it to be hyperbole. Lots of people say that. Florists use that expression. Doesn't mean that they've got somebody working for them inside the bloody room. What the hell is this organization, Bond? How can they be everywhere and we know nothing about them? - I assume we found no trace of White. - No. The agent guarding the door in the garage was dead before you passed him on the stairs. I passed him on the stairs? Christ! Mitchell must have killed him when he went out to check the perimeter. You're lucky to be here. Do you think White's still alive? - Yes, I do. - What is it? Craig Mitchell, 45 years old. No living family. Gave generously to charity. Tell me you know more than that. Our moneymen went through every bill in Mitchell's wallet and house. - How much did he have? - Less than 100 pounds, and about the same in euros and dollars. Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am. We've done a complete forensic analysis of every note and its traceable history. Not in the mood. After you. This particular note from Mitchell's wallet may be of interest. Scanning. We introduced tagged bills into Le Chiffre's money-laundering operation by intercepting illegal payoffs. We traced money through several of his bank accounts around the world. That's pretty thin. At the rate money changes hands, you could probably find a tenner in my wallet with a tag. That's true, ma'am. A single bill could be a coincidence, but what about a whole stack? These bills, from the same series as Mitchell's, were just scanned at a bank in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, deposited in the account of a Mr. Slate. Impress me. We have a Mr. Edmund Slate returning to Port-au-Prince from Heathrow this morning. His entry documents have him staying at the Hotel Dessalines. He's in room 325. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Do you have any messages for 325? No, sir. The only message was about the briefcase that was delivered earlier. - Did you want us to continue holding it? - No. No, I'll take that now. Yes, sir. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Get in! - What? - Get in. All right. You're late. I got pulled into a meeting. Who with? A friend of Mr. White's. Don't think I know him. It's funny. You don't look at all like I expected. Really? What were you expecting? I didn't think geologists looked so... So? A friend of yours? I don't have any friends. Get out of the way! Move! We didn't settle on a price. Make me an offer. We can work it out later, over drinks. Dominic didn't give you any trouble, did he? No. What the hell is this? I think someone wants to kill you. That wasn't very nice. - You were supposed to shoot her. - Well, I missed. Get Bond. - Where is he now? - Approaching the docks, Kings Quay. - Connecting. - Tanner. I've got Bond. Ask him about Slate. She wants to know about Slate. Tell her Slate was a dead end. Slate was a dead end. Connection terminated. Damn him. He killed him. Touch me and I'll break your wrist. Camille. How nice to see you. Alive, you mean? I knew we shouldn't have slept together. I think I'm starting to like you. So you did just try and have me killed. And that made me very sad thinking I would never see you again. But here you are. Damn it, Dominic! I was trying to help you. I was trying to uncover a leak. And you, you sent someone to kill me? Please don't talk to me like I'm stupid! It's unattractive. Come. I wanna show you something. Come. There's nothing that makes me more uncomfortable than friends talking behind my back. It feels like ants under my skin. It's been that way forever. I remember when I was 15, I had a crush on one of my mother's piano students. Somehow I overheard her saying very nasty things about me. I got so angry. I took an iron. Is that him? I... We only spoke on the phone. It's such a shame because he's one of my best geologists. He said you asked to buy information. No. He called me and offered to sell me information. Why would I come back here if I was lying? Because you love me. I was doing it for you. To stop him from betraying you. You know what burns more than all your bullshit? Is that I always got the feeling that you were only sleeping with me to get to General Medrano. Is that him? You know how these deposed dictators are, jealous of their safety. Stick around. I'll introduce you. Do you see the girl that just walked in here? Could you give her that? Tell her to call me. You've reached Universal Exports. Our offices are currently closed. And you can do all this for me? Well, look at what we did to this country. The Haitians elect a priest who decides to raise the minimum wage from 38 cents to $1 a day. It's not a lot, but it's enough to upset the corporations who were here making T-shirts and running shoes. So they called us, and we facilitated a change. The difference is, my country's not some flyspeck in the middle of the Caribbean. But we've already begun destabilizing the government. We'll supply the private security. We'll pay off the right officials, and we have 26 countries ready to officially recognize your new Bolivian government. You want your country back. My organization can give it to you within the week. You've been busy. And in return you want what? A desert. - This part. - This land is worthless. So you're getting a great deal. You won't find oil there. Everyone has tried. Maybe, maybe not. But we own whatever we find. Did you know Ernesto Montes? A very powerful man in his day. He had a beautiful Russian wife. A dancer. Well, his daughter works for me. Or did. She's lovely, but I don't see the resemblance. Why don't you consider her as something to sweeten the deal? Just promise me to drop her over the side when you're done. Camille, General Medrano. Be careful what you wish for, my dear. Have fun, you two. What the hell are you doing? - You're welcome! - You idiot! Take me back! You know, maybe I'll do that later. You're not one of Greene's. Dominic Greene? Get down! - Give me the wheel! - Navigate! Left! - What are you doing? - Hold on! Get down! Excuse me. Thank you. She's seasick. It's Bond. - Connect Bond. - Connecting 007. Yes? Name check, Dominic Greene. G- R-E-E-N-E. I might need a little more than that. There are a lot of Dominic Greenes. Do you have a social security or passport number? No. Scanning DGSE databases. - Anything? - Scanning KGB databases. Do you have anything? Will you put her on, please? I am on, Bond. What happened to Slate? I'm not dwelling on the past. - I don't think you should, either. - You killed him. Largest hit, Dominic Greene, CEO of Greene Planet. It's a utility company, but Greene's been doing a lot of philanthropic work, buying up large tracts of land for ecological preserves. You should be getting his picture now. Yep, that's him. I'm afraid there's a firewall around his other corporate holdings, so we have no other information. Get me the Americans. Connecting. Go ahead. Interest in Dominic Greene, Greene Planet. Transferring you now. Hold for Gregory Beam, please. Thank you. Hi, this is Gregory Beam, ma 'am. Hello, Mr. Beam. I'm so sorry to keep you waiting. We have no interest in Mr. Greene. Thank you, Mr. Beam. Connection terminated. He's a person of extreme interest. - But he just said that he wasn't... - Tanner, I asked about the man and she transferred me to the section chief of South America. How would she know to do that if they weren't tracking him? Bond, we have your location as approaching an airfield. - Is Greene on the move? - Yeah. I've got a tail number, Golf-Zero-Charlie-Sierra-Charlie. Get me a destination. It's a private charter going to Bregenz, Austria, leaving immediately. Tanner, authorize a charter for 007. And, Bond, if you could avoid killing every possible lead, it would be deeply appreciated. Yes, ma'am. I'll do my best. Connection terminated. I've heard that before. - Hello. - Hi. Welcome aboard. Come. Have a seat. Charlie-Sierra-Charlie. Jeez. Sorry. How much longer? So do we have an understanding? Yeah. We do nothing to stop a coup in Bolivia, and in exchange, the new government gives America the lease to any oil found. If it's oil you want. Well, you didn't find diamonds, did you? Drilling underground, you kept off everybody's radar for a very long time, but you can't buy that much piping without somebody getting curious. We'll have to verify the find. I'm not even admitting there is one. You are getting this for free. Venezuela, Brazil, now Bolivia. With you tied up in the Middle East, South America is falling like dominoes. You don't need another Marxist giving national resources to the people, do you? Well, we can hardly be expected to do something about a coup we know nothing about. And I have a pest. This. You have any idea who that is? Sorry. It's James Bond, British Secret Service. I don't know how I could have missed that. I will need you to get rid of him for me. Yeah. That's not gonna be a problem. You know who Greene is and you wanna put us in bed with him. You are kidding, right? Yeah. You're right. We should just deal with nice people. I need to know you're on the team, Felix. I need to know you value your career. Dominic Greene. - Good to see you. Good. - How are you? Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's performance of Tosca will begin shortly. Please take your seats. What else does General Medrano require? Anything further from Canadian intelligence? We'll discuss that later. How much more pipeline do we need? Ideally, 2,000 kilometers. Are there any objections? No. Not here. No objections. Transfer the funds from our Siberian holdings. Done. Where do the Americans stand? Well, the CIA doesn't care about another dictator as long as they get their end. But when they find out that they've been duped? I'm working on that. I'm still not sure that the Tierra Project is the best use of Quantum 's time. Perhaps we should shift our focus to the Canadian. This is the world's most precious resource. We need to control as much of it as we can. Bolivia must be top priority. Can I offer an opinion? I really think you people should find a better place to meet. Where do you think you're going? Thank you. Well, Tosca isn't for everyone. Drop it. So who are you working for? Piss off. Get rid of anything we brought with us. We've been compromised. I asked you who you were working for. - Is he one of ours? - No. Then he shouldn't be looking at me. Get me M. It's your line. Thanks. Connect call. Connecting Tanner. We've ID'd the pictures. Show me. Gregor Karakov, former minister, now owns most of the mines in Siberia, Moishe Soref, former Mossad, now telecom giant, and Guy Haines, special envoy to the Prime Minister. Get Bond. There's something else. It appears Bond shot Haines' bodyguard and threw him off a roof. - Where are you? - Did you get my pictures? Was this a conversation? Can you link these people? Is that stress in your voice? I need you to come in and debrief. - I don't have time. - Bond, you killed a man in Bregenz. I did my best not to. You shot him at point blank and threw him off a roof. I'd hardly call that showing restraint, especially since he was a member of Special Branch. So who was he guarding? Bond, are you missing the fact that you killed a member of Special Branch? I need you to come in. And I would, but right now I need to find the man who tried to kill you. Go back to sleep. Connection terminated. Restrict Bond's movements. Cancel his cards. Put an alert on his passports. All of them. And I want to know everything we don't know about Haines. Yes, ma 'am. And, Tanner, be careful who you trust with this. Hopefully, you're a better judge of character than I am. You want to follow your friends to La Paz, Bolivia? Please. I'm sorry, sir, but this doesn't work. Do you have another card? No. Could you do me a favor? You're gonna get a phone call in a minute. Would you mind telling them I'm headed for Cairo? - I'd be happy to. - Thank you. Mathis. What do you want? Come to apologize? You know, Mathis, I think retirement suits you. None for him. Sorry. He's in a bad mood today. I need a passport and matching credit cards. And Ml6 ran out of plastic? Well, oddly, right now, you're the only person I think I can trust. That is odd. But I guess when one's young, it seems very easy to distinguish between right and wrong. But as one gets older, it becomes more difficult. The villains and the heroes get all mixed up. I was sorry to hear about Vesper. I think she loved you. Right up until the moment she betrayed me. She died for you. Why did you really want to see me? I need some information. You have some hard friends. This man is some kind of facilitator. Fingers in many pies, and they don't leave any prints. - These men were together? - They're buying up oil pipeline. Something called the Tierra Project. - Do you know it? - Destroy these. That's Guy Haines. You don't know him? - Should I? - I suppose not. You haven't been keeping secrets as long as I have. He keeps a very low profile, but he's one of the Prime Minister's closest advisors. Well, they say you're judged by the strength of your enemies. Do you know anything about Bolivia? I was stationed in South America for seven years. - Well, do you have some contacts there? - A few. What do you want to know? Come with me. You can't sleep? May I fix you a drink, sir? What are you drinking? I don't know. What am I drinking? Three measures of Gordon's gin, one of vodka, half of... - Kina Lillet. - Kina Lillet, which is not Vermouth, shaken well until it is ice-cold, then served with a large thin slice of lemon peel. Six of them. That's impressive. They're good. You should have one. No, it'll just keep me awake. So what's keeping you awake? I was wondering why you came with me. It takes something to admit you were wrong. - You want a sleeping pill? - No. - Pain pill? - No. I have pills for everything. Some make you taller. Some make you forget. I'm going to try and get some sleep. Good idea. Thank you. Mr. Bond, my name is Fields. I'm from the consulate. Well, of course you are. And what do you do at the consulate, Fields? That's not important. My orders are to turn you around and put you on the first plane back to London. Do those orders include my friend Mathis? I'm sorry, I don't know who you are. You see that? Gone such a short time and already forgotten. You're just saying that to hurt me. Mr. Bond, these orders come from the highest possible authority. Taxi. Fields, when is the next flight to London? Tomorrow morning. Well then, we have all night. If you attempt to flee, I will arrest you, drop you off in jail and take you to the plane in chains. - Understand? - Perfectly. After you. - I think she has handcuffs. - I do hope so. He blames the water shortage on global warming. Hello, Carlos? Carlos. The Colonel who heads the National Police. We have a reservation. - Cmo est? - Very well, thank you. - Your name? - Miss Fields. - You're going nowhere. - So shoot me. I'd rather stay in a morgue. We are teachers on sabbatical. This fits our cover. No, it doesn't. Get in. Get in! Follow me, please. - May I show you your room, seor? - No, it's fine. Thank you. I can't find the... The stationery. Will you come and help me look? You've been invited to a party. I didn't know we had any friends here. Greene Planet. You're not coming? I'm having a drink with my friend the Colonel. I'll see you there later. Do you know how angry I am at myself? I can't imagine. You must be furious. Do you want to go to a party? A party? But I have nothing to wear. We'll fix that. It might be useful to know your real name. Fields. Just Fields. Fields it is, then. We are in a spiral of environmental decline. Since 1945, 17% of the planet's vegetated surface has been irreversibly degraded. The Tierra Project is just one small part of a global network of Eco Parks that Greene Planet has created to rejuvenate a world on the verge of collapse. I hope that tonight you make the decision to be part of that. Thank you. And have fun. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Excellent speech and congratulations. Wonderful speech, Dominic. - We need you here. - Thank you. Miss Fields, Mr. Bond, my friend Carlos. - Pleased to meet you. - Ma'am. Mr. Bond, Mathis has spoken a great deal about you. I want you to know my entire police force is at your disposal. Well, that could be very useful. You know, there are people in this country spending half their paycheck just to get clean water. What do you think of that? The Bolivian government is the problem. They cut down the trees, then act surprised when the water and the soil wash out to sea. I couldn't agree more. I hope this figure is to your liking. Chri, you shouldn't tease. Why don't you tell them about all the land you bought up outside Potos? It's been a pleasure. Will you excuse me? Of course. Somehow the logging rights went to a multinational corporation that cut down the forests, but only after our last government sold the land to Greene Planet. - Or have I got my facts crossed? - Yes, I think you did. You'll excuse us? What a wonderful night. You just cost me quite a bit of money, darling. You can't put a price on integrity. I can try. Thank you. Tell me you didn't drop by tonight just to piss on my parade. Or are you still after this General's head for your mantel? A little of both. Tell me where Medrano is and maybe you won't lose any more investors. You are really breaking my heart, choosing an insect like that over me. Are you going to throw me over? No. You've been drinking, so maybe you slipped. Just think how much you'd miss me. Good evening. There you are. Would you excuse me? Mr. Bond. What a pleasure. Well, careful with this one. She won't go to bed with you unless you give her something she really wants. It's a shame because she's really quite stunning once you get her on her back. I wish I could say the feeling was mutual. I'm sorry, Mr. Greene, but we have to go. Please. My friends call me Dominic. I'm sure they do. How much do you know about Bond, Camille? Because he's rather a tragic case. As Ml6 says, he's difficult to control. Nice way of saying that everything he touches seems to wither and die. Shall we? Doesn't bode well for you, I'm afraid. You two do make a charming couple, though. You're both... What's the expression? Damaged goods. Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry. Come on, lighten up. You're cramping my style. So it's British intelligence now. What the hell do you want from me? You're gonna show me Dominic Greene's Tierra Project. - Are you up to it? - Do I have a choice? Do you want one? There's something horribly efficient about you. Is that a compliment? Well, what's the bet that Dominic Greene has friends in the police force? Stay here. Now, why would you want me to do that? Mathis? There's a hospital on the other side of town. Please. Stay with me. Stay here, please. Please. Come here. It's okay. That's better. That doesn't hurt. Is Mathis your cover name? Yes. Not a very good one, is it? Do we forgive each other? I shouldn't have left you alone. Vesper. She gave everything for you. Forgive her. Forgive yourself. Is that how you treat your friends? He wouldn't care. Let's go. The Foreign Secretary's asking to see you. What don't I know? Ren Mathis has been shot dead in Bolivia. The police claim it was Bond. How much did you pay him? Well, he wanted you, but I left him the car as collateral. He'll make much more when he sells us out. Right. Let's see if this thing'll fly. Here. All the information I found said there was nothing of value there, but Greene's geologist had proof that there was. My sources tell me you're Bolivian Secret Service, or used to be, and that you infiltrated Greene's organization by having sex with him. - That offends you? - No, not in the slightest. So what's your interest in Greene? Amongst other things, he tried to kill a friend of mine. - A woman? - Yes. But it's not what you think. - Your mother? - She likes to think so. What's that down there? That's a sinkhole. There are a few around here. Just for the record, I wasn't with Greene for my... Damn it! I think we lost him! He's coming fast! He's right behind you! Here. Put that on! Come on! Camille! According to the Bolivians, it was a routine stop, and when they discovered Mathis' body, Bond disarmed and shot them. Of course, there are no witnesses to prove otherwise. I need something. I can't go in there unarmed. I'm sorry. There's nothing. Come in. What's today's excuse? That Bond is legally blind? No, Minister. I don't think I need to tell you how upset the PM is. With respect, the PM has my direct line. And he'd have used it if he'd wanted to speak to you. I'm sorry, M. Things have changed. We've had long discussions with our cousins. Mr. Greene's interests and ours now align. Minister, this man is a major player in one of the most dangerous organizations... We've never even heard of. Foreign policy cannot be conducted on the basis of hunches and innuendo. Then give us time to gather enough evidence so you can make informed decisions. Fine. Say you're right. Say Greene is a villain. If we refused to do business with villains, we'd have almost no one to trade with. The world's running out of oil, M. The Russians aren't playing ball. The Americans and Chinese are dividing up what's left. Right or wrong doesn't come into it. We're acting out of necessity. Bond is running wild. Who's to say he hasn't been turned? Pull him in or the Americans will put him down. I think I found a way out. You're freezing. I'm fine. So what is it that Greene has that you want? It's not Greene. It's Medrano, the man he met in Haiti. My father worked for the military junta. He was a very cruel man, but he was my father. When I was a small child the opposition sent general Medrano to our house. He shot my father. He did things to my mother and my sister and then strangled them while I watched. I was too young to be any trouble, so he just smiled at me and set the house on fire. He left his mark. So when I pulled you off the boat... I waited years for that chance. I apologize. It seems we're both using Greene to get to somebody. You lost somebody? I did, yes. You catch whoever did it? No. Not yet. Tell me when you do. I'd like to know how it feels. We should go. You ready? They used dynamite. This used to be a riverbed. Greene isn't after the oil. He wants the water. We can't leave it like this. It's one dam. He's creating a drought. He'll have built others. Excuse me, sir. Your wife left a message. The English woman, she left it for you this morning. - Thank you. - My pleasure. What is it? Would you mind waiting down here? I'll be outside. So that's what she meant. I hope you can trust these men. Just a moment. It's Tanner. Yes? We've got the girl downstairs. She says to tell you she's sorry but this is not her fight. It isn't. Let her go. She isn't our concern. Well, I'm disappointed. You are? How much oil did the Americans promise you? This isn't about oil. - Well, that's good, because there isn't any. - It's about trust. You said you weren't motivated by revenge. - I'm motivated by my duty. - No. I think you are so blinded by inconsolable rage that you don't care who you hurt. When you can't tell your friends from your enemies, it's time to go. You might like to tell her your theory about there being no oil. Her lungs are full of it. - It was Greene. - No doubt. But why? - It's just misdirection. - I mean, why her, Bond? She was just supposed to send you home. She worked in an office, collecting reports. Look how well your charm works, James. They'll do anything for you, won't they? How many is that now? You're removed from duty and suspended pending further investigation. You'll give whatever weapons you have to these men and leave with them now. Miss Fields showed true bravery. I want that mentioned in your report. - Now you and I need to see this through. - There's nowhere to go. There's a capture or kill order out on you. Who would have done that? - Ma'am? - Find out where he's going. - He's on to something. - Ma'am, the CIA is insisting... I could give a shit about the CIA or their trumped-up evidence. He's my agent, and I trust him. Go on. - Get in. - Are you gonna try and shoot me? I said, get in. You're gonna get botulism if you keep drinking that. It's bottled water. It probably came from some stream just around the corner from here. Bunch of little kids peeing in it. That's why I eat the peppers. Well, all I'm saying is you can't trust a damn thing around here. You know, you should just answer, ""CIA,"" Felix. A taxi driver told me where the office was. Well, if we're so easy to find, James, you really should come visit. Or maybe you should come out and see some more of the city. I heard a rumor you'd gone native. Felix. You know, I was just wondering what South America would look like if nobody gave a damn about coke or communism. It's always impressed me the way you boys have carved this place up. I'll take that as a compliment coming from a Brit. Are you sure you're playing with the right side? Regimes change once a week down here. Medrano'll be no dirtier than the next guy. Oh, you see, that's what I like about U.S. intelligence. You'll lie down with anybody. Including you, brother. Including you. Do you know you're being played? Dominic Greene's gonna suck this place dry, and then he's gonna move on, and you're gonna be left picking up the broken crockery. What can I tell you? There's no such thing as a free lunch. Well, you see, Felix, I don't think you're half as cynical as you make out to be. You don't know me. Why? Just because you didn't come alone? - How long have I got? - Thirty seconds. Well, that doesn't give us a lot of time, does it? Medrano can't move until he pays off the army and the police chief. Greene's bringing him his money now. A hotel called La Perla de las Dunas in the desert. Thank you, Felix. James, move your ass. Get down! Get down, now! Move it! Move it! What the hell happened? What did you tell him? Just what we agreed. What are you doing? The slide's caught. Maybe you should check your own. I will. Have you ever killed someone? Your training will tell you that when the adrenaline kicks in you should compensate. But part of you is not gonna believe the training because this kill is personal. Take a deep breath. You only need one shot. Make it count. In euros, as requested. The dollar isn't what it once was. The cost of war. I am afraid that the corruption in this current government can no longer be tolerated. And mine? Right after you sign over my land. My first official act. And this, if you would. What is this? As of this moment, my organization owns more than 60% of Bolivia's water supply. So this contract states that your new government will use us as utilities provider. This is double what we are paying now. Well, then don't sign it. But you should know something about me and the people I work with. We deal with the left or the right, with dictators or liberators. If the current president had been more agreeable, I wouldn't be talking to you. So, if you decide not to sign, you will wake up with your balls in your mouth and your willing replacement standing over you. If you doubt that, then shoot me, take that money and have a good night's sleep. You and I had a mutual friend. Sounds like you just lost another one. Not this way. Not this way. I can't. I can't. Come here. Like you said, ""Take a deep breath. ""Make it count."" Close your eyes. Come on! Wait here. - You promised that you'd... - Let you go? I answered your questions. I told you what you wanted to know about Quantum. Yes, you did, and your friends'd know that so they're probably looking for you. But the good news is, you're in the middle of a desert. Here. I bet you make it 20 miles before you consider drinking that. Goodbye, Mr. Greene. Thank you. It's my pleasure. Are you all right? Fine. But I keep thinking, ""He's dead. ""Now what?"" Well, the dam we saw will have to come down, and there'll be others, too. Someone who worked for Greene might be of help. Not a bad idea. Do you think they'll be able to sleep now? I don't think the dead care about vengeance. I wish I could set you free. But your prison is in there. Fine. Anything for an easy life. Sit down. Sit down! It's okay, baby. You're Canadian? You work in Canadian intelligence? It's all right. I know you do. And knowing this man, I'd guess you have access to some very sensitive material which you're gonna be forced to give up. His life will be threatened, and because you love him, you won't hesitate. It's a beautiful necklace. Did he give it to you? I have one just like it. He gave it to a friend of mine, someone very close to me. Your name is? - Corrine. - Corrine. Corrine, I suggest you leave now. You contact your people, and you tell them to check their seals. They have a leak. Do it now, please. This man and I have some unfinished business. Thank you. Please. Make it quick. Is he still alive? He is. I'm surprised. Did you find what you were looking for? - Yes. - Good. - I assume you have no regrets. - I don't. What about you? Of course not. That would be unprofessional. They found Greene dead in the middle of the Bolivian desert, of all places. Two bullets in the back of his skull. They found motor oil in his stomach. Does that mean anything to you? Wish I could help. You'll be glad to know, I straightened things out with the Americans. Your friend Leiter's been promoted. He replaced Beam. Well, then the right people kept their jobs. Something like that. Congratulations. You were right. About what? About Vesper. Ma'am. Bond, I need you back. I never left.

Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail these waters. You don't want to bring them down on us. Mr. Gibbs, that will do. She was singing about pirates! Bad luck to sing about pirates with us mired in this unnatural fog. - Mark my words. - Consider them marked. - On your way. - Aye, Lieutenant. Bad luck to have a woman on board, too. Even a miniature one. It'd be exciting to meet a pirate. Think again, Miss Swann. Vile creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag gets what he deserves. A short drop and a sudden stop. I appreciate your fervor, but I'm concerned about the effect this subject will have upon my daughter. My apologies, Governor Swann. - Actually, I find it all fascinating. - That's what concerns me. There's a boy in the water! Man overboard! Man the ropes! Fetch a hook! Haul him aboard! He's still breathing. Mary, Mother of God! What happened here? Most likely the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed. Lot of good it did them. Everyone's thinking it, I'm saying it. Pirates! There's no proof of that! It was probably an accident. Rouse the captain. Heave to and take in sail. Launch the boats. Elizabeth, accompany the boy. He'll be in your charge. Take care of him. He'll be in your charge. Take care of him. It's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann. Will Turner. I'm watching over you, Will. You're a pirate! Has he said anything? His name's William Turner. That's all I found out. Take him below. Elizabeth! Are you all right? Are you decent? Yes. Yes? Still abed at this hour? It's a beautiful day. I have a gift for you. - It's beautiful! - Isn't it? May I inquire as to the occasion? Does a father need an occasion to dote upon his daughter? Go on. Actually... I had hoped you might wear it for the ceremony today. The ceremony? Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony. I knew it! Commodore Norrington, as he's about to become. A fine gentleman, don't you think? He fancies you, you know. Elizabeth? How's it coming? - It's difficult to say. - It's the latest fashion in London. Women in London must've learned not to breathe! My Lord, you have a visitor. Mr. Turner! Good to see you again. Good day, sir. I have your order. The blade is folded steel. That's gold filigree laid into the handle. If I may? Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly the width of the blade. Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly the width of the blade. Impressive. Very impressive. Commodore Norrington's going to be very pleased with this. Do pass my compliments onto your master. I shall. A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated. Elizabeth! You look absolutely stunning! Will! It's so good to see you! - I had a dream about you last night. - About me? - Elizabeth, is that proper? - About the day we met. Remember? How could I forget, Miss Swann? How many times must I ask you to call me Elizabeth? At least once more, Miss Swann. As always. There. See? At least the boy has a sense of propriety. We really must be going. Good day, Mr. Turner. Come along! Good day... Elizabeth. Hold up there, you! It's a shilling to tie up your boat to the dock. I need to know your name. What do you say to three shillings and we forget the name? Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith. Two paces... march! Right about... face! Present... arms! This dock is off limits to civilians. This dock is off limits to civilians. I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know. If I see one, I shall inform you. I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know. If I see one, I shall inform you. There's some high-toned and fancy to-do at the fort. How could it be that two upstanding gentlemen did not merit an invitation? We have to make sure this dock stays off limits to civilians. It's a fine goal, to be sure, but it seems to me, a ship like that makes this one here a bit superfluous. The Dauntless is the power in these waters, but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed. I've heard of one. It's supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable. The Black Pearl. There's no real ship that can match the Interceptor. The Black Pearl is a real ship. - No, it's not. - It is. I've seen it! - You've seen it? - Yes. - You haven't seen it! - Yes, I have! You've seen a ship with black sails, that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that Hell itself spat him back out? - No. - No. But I have seen a ship with black sails. No ship not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil, Hell spat him back out, could have black sails, so couldn't be any other ship than The Black Pearl. Is that what you're saying? No. Like I said, there's no real ship that can match the Interceptor... You! Get away from there! You don't have permission to be aboard! I'm sorry, but it's such a pretty boat. Ship! - What's your name? - Smith! Or Smithy, if you like. What's your purpose in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'? - And no lies! - All right. I confess. I intend to commandeer a ship, pick up a crew in Tortuga, I intend to commandeer a ship, pick up a crew in Tortuga, rape, pillage and otherwise pilfer my black guts out. - I said no lies! - I think he's telling the truth. If he were telling the truth, he wouldn't have told us. Unless he knew you wouldn't believe the truth even if he told you. May I have a moment? You look lovely, Elizabeth. I apologize if I seem forward, but I must speak my mind. This promotion throws into sharp relief that which I have not yet achieved. A marriage to a fine woman. You have become a fine woman. I can't breathe! Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself. Then they made me their chief. Elizabeth? Elizabeth! The rocks! Sir, it's a miracle she missed them! - Will you be saving her? - I can't swim! Pride of the King's Navy, you are! Do not lose these. What was that? I got her! - She's not breathing! - Move! - I never would've thought of that. - You've never been to Singapore. Where did you get that? On your feet. Elizabeth! - Are you all right? - I'm fine. - Shoot him! - Father! Commodore, do you intend to kill my rescuer? I believe thanks are in order. Had a brush with the East India Trading Company, pirate? Hang him! Keep your guns on him, men. Gillette, fetch some irons. Well, well. Jack Sparrow, isn't it? Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please, sir. I don't see your ship... 'Captain'. I'm in the market, as it were. He said he'd come to commandeer one. I told you he was telling the truth. These are his. No additional shot nor powder. A compass that doesn't point north. I half expected it to be made from wood. You are without doubt the worst pirate I've ever heard of! But you have heard of me. Commodore, I must protest! Carefully, Lieutenant. Pirate or not, this man saved my life! One good deed is not enough to redeem a man for his wickedness! - It seems enough to condemn him. - Indeed. Finally. - Don't shoot! - I knew you'd warm up to me. Commodore Norrington, my effects, please. And my hat. Commodore. - Elizabeth... it is Elizabeth? - It's Miss Swann. Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind. Come, dear, we don't have all day. If you'll be very kind. Easy on the goods, darling. - You're despicable. - Sticks and stones, love. I saved your life, you saved mine. We're square. Gentlemen, my lady, you will always remember this as the day you almost caught... Captain Jack Sparrow! - Now will you shoot him? - Open fire! On his heels! Take cover, man! Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn appointment with the gallows. I would hate for him to miss it. Search up the stairs! Look lively, men! Right where I left you. Not where I left you. You're the one they're hunting. The pirate! You seem familiar. Have I threatened you before? I avoid familiarity with pirates. It would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. Excuse me. Do you think this wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate? You threatened Miss Swann. Only a little. You know what you're doing. Excellent form. How's your footwork? If I step here... Good. And now I step again. Ta. That is a wonderful trick. Except, once again, you are between me and my way out. And now... you have no weapon. Who makes all these? I do. And I practice with them three hours a day. You need to find yourself a girl, mate. Or, the reason you practice three hours a day is that you already found one and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet. You're not a eunuch, are you? I practice three hours a day so when I meet a pirate, I can kill him! - You cheated! - Pirate. - Move away! - No. Please? No! I cannot just step aside and let you escape. This shot is not meant for you. There he is! Over here! Excellent work, Mr. Brown. You've assisted in the capture of a fugitive. Just doing my civic duty, sir. I trust you will remember this as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped. Take him away. - Come here, boy. Come here. - Who wants a juicy bone? Come here, boy! You can keep doing that forever. The dog is never going to move. Excuse us if we haven't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet. There you go, miss. It was a difficult day for you, I'm sure. I suspected Commodore Norrington would propose, but I wasn't prepared for it. I meant you being threatened by that pirate! Sounds terrifying! Yes, it was terrifying. But... the Commodore proposed! Fancy that. That's a smart match, miss, if it's not too bold to say. It is a smart match. He's a fine man. He's what any woman should dream of marrying. That Will Turner... he's a fine man, too. That is too bold. Beggin' your pardon. It was not my place. Has my daughter given you an answer yet? No, she hasn't. She has had a trying day. - Ghastly weather, don't you think? - Really bleak. What's that? Cannon fire! Return fire! I know those guns. It's the Pearl. The Black Pearl? I've heard stories. She's been preying on ships and settlements for ten years. - Never leaves any survivors. - No survivors? Then where do the stories come from, I wonder? Mama! - Sight the muzzle flash. - Aim for the flashes! I need a full spread, fore and aft. Mr. Stevens, more cartridges. Governor. Barricade yourself in my office. That's an order. Don't! Hello, chum. Up there! Miss Swann, they've come to kidnap you. - What? - You're the governor's daughter! In here! They haven't seen you. First chance you get, run to the fort. Gotcha! No! It's hot. I'm burning! Come on! Come on, me men. We know you're here, poppet. - Poppet! - Come out. We promise we won't hurt you. We will find you, poppet. You've got something of ours and it calls to us. The gold calls to us. The gold. Hello, poppet. Parley. - What? - I invoke the right of parley. The Code of the Brethren states you have to take me to your captain. I know the Code. You can do me no harm until the parley is complete. - To blazes with the Code. - She wants to be taken to the Captain. And she'll go, without a fuss. We must honor the Code. Say goodbye! Goodbye. - Come on. - Elizabeth. Out of my way, scum! My sympathies. You've no manner of luck at all. Come on, doggy! It's just you and me now. It's you and old Jack. Come on. That's a boy! Get your bone! That's a good boy. A bit closer! That's it, doggy! Come on, you filthy, slimy, mangy character! No! I didn't mean it! This ain't the armory! Well, well, well. Look what we have here, Twigg. Captain Jack Sparrow! Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a godforsaken island, shrinking into the distance. His fortunes aren't improved much. Worry about your own fortunes, gentlemen. The deepest circle of Hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers. So there is a curse. - That's interesting. - You know nothing of Hell. That's very interesting. I didn't know we was takin' on captives. She's invoked the right of parley with Captain Barbossa. - I am here to... - You will speak when spoken to. And ye will not lay a hand on those under the protection of parley. Aye, sir. My apologies, miss. Captain Barbossa... I am here to negotiate the cessation of hostilities. There are a lot of long words there. We're naught but humble pirates. - What is it you want? - Leave and never come back. I'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request. Means ""no."" Very well. I'll drop it. Me holds are burstin' with swag. That bit of shine matters to us? Why? It's what you've been searching for. I recognize the ship. I saw it eight years ago on the crossing from England! Did you now? Fine. I suppose if it is worthless there's no point in me keeping it. No! You have a name, missy? Elizabeth... Turner. I'm a maid in the Governor's household. Miss Turner! - Turner! - Bootstrap! How does a maid come to own that trinket? Family heirloom? I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean. You hand it over and we'll leave and never return. Our bargain? Still the guns and stow them. Signal the men and make good to clear port. You have to take me to shore. According to the Code... First... Your return to shore was not part of our negotiations so I must do nothing. Secondly, you must be a pirate for the Pirate's Code to apply, and you're not. Thirdly, the code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules. Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner. They've taken Elizabeth! Mr. Murtogg, remove this man. We have to hunt them down. We must save her. Where do you propose we start? If you have any information concerning my daughter, share it. That Jack Sparrow. He talked about the Black Pearl. Mentioned it is more what he did. Ask him where it is! He could lead us to it. No. The pirates left Sparrow in his cell, ergo they are not his allies. We will establish their most likely course... That's not good enough! Mr. Turner, you are not a military man or a sailor. You are a blacksmith. And this is not the moment for rash actions! Do not think you are the only man here who cares for Elizabeth. Please. - You! Sparrow! - Aye? You are familiar with the Black Pearl? - I've heard of it. - Where does it make berth? Where does it make berth? Have you not heard the stories? Captain Barbossa and his crew of miscreants sail from the Isla de Muerta. It's an island that cannot be found, except by those who know where it is. The ship's real, therefore its anchorage must be a real place. Where? - Why ask me? - Because you're a pirate. You want to turn pirate yourself. Is that it? Never! - They took Miss Swann. - So it is that you found a girl! I see! If you intend to brave all, hasten to her rescue, and so, win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone, mate. I see no profit in it for me. - I can get you out of here. - The key's run off. I helped build these cells. These are half-pin barrel hinges. With leverage and the proper application of strength, the door will lift free. - What's your name? - Will Turner. That would be short for William, I imagine. Good, strong name. No doubt named for your father. Yes. Mr. Turner, I've changed me mind. If you spring me from here, I swear, on pain of death, I shall take you to the Black Pearl, and your bonny lass. Do we have an accord? - Agreed. - Agreed! Get me out! - Hurry! Someone will have heard that. - Not without my effects. We're going to steal a ship? - That ship? - Commandeer. We're going to ""commandeer"" that ship. Nautical term. One question about your business, or there's no use going. This girl, how far are you willing to go to save her? - I'd die for her. - Good. No worries then. This is either madness or brilliance. It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide. Everyone stay calm! We're taking over the ship. Aye! Avast! This ship cannot be crewed by two men. You'll never make it out of the bay. Son... I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. Savvy? - Commodore! - They're taking the Dauntless! Commodore! They've taken the ship! Sparrow and Turner! They're taking the Dauntless! Rash, Turner. Too rash. That is, without doubt, the worst pirate I have ever seen. Here they come. Bring her around! Search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges. Sailors, back to the Interceptor! Thank you, Commodore, for getting us ready to make way. We'd have had a hard time by ourselves. Set topsails and clear up this mess. With this wind we won't catch them. I don't need to. Get them in range of the long nines. Run out the guns! We are to fire on our own ship, sir? I'd rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate. Commodore! He's disabled the rudder chain. Abandon ship! That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen. So it would seem. When I was a lad living in England, my mother raised me by herself. After she died, I came here, looking for my father. Is that so? My father, Bill Turner? It was only after you learned my name you agreed to help. Since that's what I wanted, I didn't press the matter. I'm not a simpleton. You knew my father. I knew him. Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner. Everyone else just called him ""Bootstrap"". Bootstrap? Good man. Good pirate. I swear, you look just like him. It's not true. He was a merchant sailor. A respectable man who obeyed the law. He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag. My father was not a pirate! Put it away, son. It's not worth you getting beat again. You ignored the rules of engagement. In a fair fight, I'd kill you. That's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it? As long as you're just hanging there, pay attention. The only rules that matter are these: What a man can do and what a man can't do. You can accept your father was a pirate and a good man, or you can't. Pirate is in your blood, so you'll have to square with that someday. Me, for example, I can let you drown, but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga all by me onesies, savvy? So. Can you sail under the command of a pirate? Or can you not? Tortuga? Tortuga. It is a sad life that has never breathed deep the sweet, proliferous bouquet that is Tortuga. Savvy? What do you think? - It'll linger. - I'll tell you, mate, if every town were like this one, no man would ever feel unwanted. Scarlett! Not sure I deserved that. Not sure I deserved that. Giselle. Giselle. - Who was she? - What? I may have deserved that. Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot! Mother's love! Jack! You should know not to wake a man when he's sleepin'. - It's bad luck. - Fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink. The man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to his proposition. Aye, that'll about do it. Blast! I'm already awake! That was for the smell. Keep a sharp eye. Now, what's the nature of this venture of your'n? Now, what's the nature of this venture of your'n? I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm gonna take it. Jack, it's a fool's errand. You know better than me the tales of the Black Pearl. That's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew. Captain Barbossa is not a man to suffer fools nor strike a bargain with one. It's a good thing I'm not a fool, then. Prove me wrong. What makes you think Barbossa will give up his ship to you? Let's just say it's a matter of leverage. The kid? That is the child of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His only child. Savvy? Is he now? Leverage, says you. I feel a change in the wind, says I. I'll find us a crew. There's bound to be some sailors on this rock crazy as you. One can only hope. - Take what you can! - Give nothin' back! - Take what you can! - Give nothin' back! You'll be dining with the captain, and he requests you wear this. Tell him that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request. He said you'd say that. He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew. And you'll be naked. Fine. There's no need to stand on ceremony, no call to impress anyone. You must be hungry. Try the wine. And the apples. One of those next. It's poisoned. There would be no sense to be killing you. Then release me. You have your trinket. I'm of no further value to you. You don't know what this is, do you? It's a pirate medallion. This is Aztec gold. One of 882 identical pieces they delivered in a stone chest to Corts. Blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon them with his armies. Blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon them with his armies. But the greed of Corts was insatiable. So the heathen gods placed upon the gold... a terrible curse. Any mortal that removes but a single piece from that stone chest... shall be punished for eternity. Shall be punished for eternity. I hardly believe in ghost stories any more, Captain Barbossa. Aye. That's exactly what I thought when we were first told the tale. Buried on an island of the dead what cannot be found, except for those who know where it is. Find it, we did. There be the chest. Inside be the gold. And we took 'em all! We spent 'em and traded 'em, and frittered 'em away on drink and food and pleasurable company. The more we gave 'em away, the more we came to realize... the drink would not satisfy. Food turned to ash in our mouths, Food turned to ash in our mouths, and all the pleasurable company in the world could not slake our lust. We are cursed men, Miss Turner. Compelled by greed we were, but now... we are consumed by it. There is one way we can end our curse. All the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold must be restored, and the blood repaid. Thanks to ye, we have the final piece. And the blood to be repaid? That's why there's no sense to be killing you. Yet. Apple? I'm curious. After killing me, what are you planning on doing next? Look! The moonlight shows us for what we really are. We are not among the living and so we cannot die. We are not among the living and so we cannot die. But neither are we dead. For too long I've been parched of thirst and unable to quench it. Too long I've been starvin' to death and haven't died. Too long I've been starvin' to death and haven't died. I feel nothing. Not the wind on my face, nor the spray of the sea... nor the warmth of a woman's flesh. You best start believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner. You're in one! What are you looking at? Back to work! You heard the captain. Back to work. Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them, faithful hands before the mast. Every man worth his salt, and crazy to boot. So this is your able-bodied crew? - You, sailor! - Cotton, sir. Mr. Cotton, do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death? - Mr. Cotton. Answer, man! - He's a mute, sir. Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so he trained the parrot to talk for him. No one's yet figured how. Mr. Cotton's parrot, same question. Wind in your sails! Wind in your sails! Mostly, we figure that means ""yes"". Of course it does. Satisfied? Well, you've proved they're mad. What's the benefit for us? Anamaria! - I suppose you didn't deserve that. - No, that one I deserved. - You stole my boat! - Actually... Borrowed without permission, but with every intention of bringing it back. - But you didn't! - You'll get another one. - I will. - A better one. A better one! - That one. - What one? That one? Aye. That one. - What say you? - Aye! Aye! Anchor's aweigh! No, it's frightful bad luck to bring a woman aboard, sir. It'll be far worse not to have her. How can we sail to an island that nobody can find, with a compass that doesn't work? The compass doesn't point north, but we're not trying to find north, are we? We should drop canvas, sir. She can hold a bit longer. What's in your head as puts you in such a fine mood, Cap'n? We're catching up. Time to go, poppet. Dead men tell no tales. Chills the bones, how many honest sailors been claimed by this passage. How is it that Jack came by that compass? Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow before he came to Tortuga with a mind to find the treasure of the Isla de Muerta. That was before I'd met him, when he was captain of the Black Pearl. What? - He failed to mention that. - He plays things close to the vest now. And a hard-learned lesson it was. Three days into the trip, the first mate says, ""Everything's an equal share."" ""The location of the treasure, too."" So Jack gives up the bearings. That night, there was a mutiny. They marooned Jack on an island and left him to die. But not before he'd gone mad with the heat. So that's the reason for all the... Reason's got nothing to do with it. When a pirate's marooned, he's given a pistol with a single shot. One shot. That won't do much good hunting, nor to be rescued. But after three weeks of a starving belly and thirst, that pistol looks real friendly. But Jack escaped the island, and still has that single shot. He won't use it, though, save on one man. His mutinous first mate. - Barbossa. - Aye. - How did Jack get off the island? - I'll tell ye. He waded out into the shallows, and waited three days and three nights, till all manner of sea creatures became acclimated to his presence. On the fourth morning, he roped a couple of sea turtles, lashed them together and made a raft. - He roped a couple of sea turtles. - Aye. What did he use for rope? Human hair. From my back. - Let go the anchor! - Lower the anchor line! Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore. Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore. Captain. What if the worst should happen? - Keep to the Code. - Aye. The Code. - Ten years of hoarding swag. - Now we finally get to spend it. Once we're quit of the curse, we'll be rich men... and you can buy an eye that fits and is made of glass. This one does splinter something terrible. Stop rubbing it. What code is Gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen? Pirates' Code. Any man who falls behind is left behind. No heroes amongst thieves. For having such a bleak outlook on pirates you're well on your way to becoming one. Sprung a man from jail, commandeered a ship of the fleet, sailed with a buccaneer crew out of Tortuga... and you're completely obsessed with treasure. That's not true. I am not obsessed with treasure. Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate. Gentlemen, the time has come! Salvation is nigh! - Our torment is nearing an end! - Elizabeth. For ten years we've been tested and tried and each man here has proved his mettle a hundred times over and a hundred times again! Suffered, I have! Punished we were, the lot of us, disproportionate to our crime! Here it is! The cursed treasure of Corts himself. Every last piece that went astray, we have returned. Save for this! - Jack! - Not yet. We wait for the opportune moment. When's that? When it's of greatest profit to you? May I ask you something? Have I ever given you reason not to trust me? Do us a favor. I know it's difficult for you, but please stay here. And try not to do anything stupid. Who among us has paid the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods? - Us! - And whose blood must yet be paid? Hers! You know the first thing I'm going to do after the curse is lifted? Eat a whole bushel of apples! Begun by blood. By blood undone. Sorry, Jack. I'm not going to be your leverage. That's it? Waste not. Did it work? - I don't feel no different. - How do we tell? You're not dead! No. - He shot me. - It didn't work. The curse is still upon us! You! Maid! Your father, what was his name? Was your father William Turner? No. Where's his child who sailed from England eight years ago? The child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner? Where? You two! You brought us the wrong person! No! She had the medallion. She's the proper age. She said her name was Turner. You heard her. I think she lied to us. You brought us here for nothing. I won't take questioning, not from the likes of you, Master Twigg. Who's to blame him? Your decisions have led us from bad to worse! It was you who sent Bootstrap to the depths! And it's you who brought us here in the first place! If any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak! I say we cut her throat and spill all her blood. Just in case. Yeah! The medallion! She's taken it! Get after her, you feckless pack of ingrates! - Where are the oars? - There's no oars! The oars have gone missing! Find them! You! - You're supposed to be dead. - Am I not? Pearlie... Palu-li-la-la-lulu... Parlili... Parsnip... Parsley... Partner... - Parley? - That's the one! Parley! Parley! Parley? Damn to the depths whatever muttonhead thought of parley! That would be the French. - Not more pirates. - Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth. Mr. Gibbs? Hey, boy, where be Jack? Jack Sparrow? He fell behind. Keep to the Code. Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails! Split-quick, you dibbies! How the blazes did you get off that island? When you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. Well, I won't be making that mistake again. Gents, you all remember Captain Jack Sparrow? Aye. Kill him. The girl's blood didn't work, did it? Hold your fire! You know whose blood we need. I know whose blood you need. What sort of a man trades a man's life for a ship? A pirate. Here. Let me. Thank you. You said you gave Barbossa my name as yours. Why? I don't know. I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands. - They're rough. - No. I mean, yes, they are, but... Don't stop. Elizabeth. It's yours. I thought I'd lost it the day they rescued me. It was a gift from my father. He sent it to me. Why did you take it? Because I was afraid that you were a pirate. That would've been awful. It wasn't your blood they needed. It was my father's blood. My blood. - The blood of a pirate. - Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. So you expect to leave me on some beach with nothing but a name and your word it's the one I need, and watch you sail away in my ship. No. I expect to leave you standing on some beach with absolutely no name at all, watching me sail away on my ship, and then I'll shout the name back to you. Savvy? But that still leaves me standing on some beach, with naught but a name and your word it's the one I need. Of the two of us, I am the only one who hasn't committed mutiny. Therefore, my word is the one we'll be trusting. Although, I suppose I should be thanking you because, in fact, if you hadn't betrayed me and left me to die, I would have an equal share in that curse, same as you. Funny old world, isn't it? Captain! We're coming up on the Interceptor. I'm having a thought here, Barbossa. What say we run up a flag of truce, I scurry over to the Interceptor, and I negotiate the return of your medallion? Now that's exactly the attitude that lost you the Pearl. People are easier to search when they're dead. Lock him in the brig. Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants! With this wind, she'll carry every sail we've got. - What's happening? - The Black Pearl is gaining on us! This is the fastest ship in the Caribbean. Tell them that after they've caught us. - We're shallower on the draft, right? - Aye. Then can't we lose them on those shoals? We don't have to outrun 'em long. Just long enough. Lighten the ship! Stem to stern! Anything we can afford to lose, see that it's lost! Apparently, there's a leak. Haul on the main brace! Make ready the guns! And run out the sweeps. We're gonna need that. It was a good plan, up till now. Gibbs! We have to make a stand. We must fight! - Load the guns! - With what? Anything! Everything! Anything we have left. Load the guns! Case shot and langrage! Nails and crushed glass! With a will! The Pearl will luff up on our port quarter. She'll rake us without presenting a target. Lower the anchor on the right side. On the starboard side! - It has the element of surprise. - You're daft, lady. You both are. Daft like Jack. Lower the starboard anchor! Do it, you gobs, or it's you we'll load into the cannons! Let go! They're club hauling. Hard a port! Rack the starboard oars! Hard a port! Keep her steady, man. - Now! - Fire! Fire all! Stop blowing holes in my ship! - We need more ideas, lass! - It's your turn! - We need us a devil's dowry! - We'll give them her! She's not what they're after. The medallion. Strike your colors, you bloomin' cockroaches! Hands, grapnels at the ready! Prepare to board! Pistols and cutlasses, men! Koehler, Twigg, to the powder magazine! And the rest of you, bring me the medallion! Below! Thanks very much. Jack! Bloody empty! That's not very nice. - Where is the medallion? - Wretch! Where is dear William? Will. Elizabeth! Monkey! I can't move it! Elizabeth! - Thank you, Jack. - You're welcome. Not you. We named the monkey Jack. Gents! Our hope is restored! Any of you so much as thinks the word ""parley"", I'll have your guts for garters! Will. You godless pirate! Welcome back, miss. You took advantage of our hospitality last time. It holds fair now you return the favor. Barbossa! Will. She goes free! What's in your head, boy? She goes free. You've only got one shot, and we can't die. Don't do anything stupid. You can't. I can. Like that. - Who are you? - No one. He's no one. A distant cousin of my aunt's nephew, twice removed. Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch. My name is Will Turner! My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins. It's the spitting image of old Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us. On my word, do as I say, or I'll pull this trigger, and be lost to Davy Jones' locker! Name your terms, Mr. Turner. - Elizabeth goes free! - Yes, we know that one. Anything else? And the crew. The crew are not to be harmed. Agreed. Barbossa, you lying bastard. You swore she'd go free. Don't dare impugn me honor, boy. I agreed she'd go free. It was you who failed to specify when or where. Though it does seem a shame to lose something so fine, don't it, lads? So I'll be havin' that dress back before you go. I always liked you. Goes with your black heart. It's still warm. Off you go. Come on. Too long. I'd really rather hoped we were past all this. Jack. Jack! Did you not notice? That be the same island that we made you governor of on our last little trip. I did notice. Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up another miraculous escape. But I doubt it. Off you go. Last time you left me a pistol with one shot. By the powers, you're right. Where be Jack's pistol? Bring it forward. Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman would give us a pair of pistols. It'll be one pistol as before, and you can be the gentleman and shoot the lady, and starve to death yourself. That's the second time I've watched that man take my ship. You were marooned on this island before. We can escape in the same way. To what point and purpose, young missy? The Black Pearl is gone. Unless you have a lot of sails hidden in that bodice... Unlikely. ...young Mr. Turner will be dead long before you can reach him. But you're Captain Jack Sparrow. You vanished from under the eyes of seven agents of the East India Company. You sacked Nassau port without even firing a shot. Are you the pirate I've read about or not? How did you escape last time? Last time I was here a grand total of three days. Last time... the rum runners used this island as a cache. They came by and I was able to barter passage off. From the looks of things, they've long been out of business. You probably have your bloody friend Norrington to thank for that. So that's it, then? That's the secret, grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow. You spent three days lying on a beach drinking rum. Welcome to the Caribbean, love. We're devils, we're black sheep We're really bad eggs Drink up, me hearties, yo ho Yo ho, yo ho A pirate's life for me I love this song! Really bad eggs! When I get the Pearl back, I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time. You will be the most fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main. Not just the Spanish Main, love. The entire ocean. The entire world! Wherever we want to go, we go. That's what a ship is. It's not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails. That's what a ship needs. But what a ship is... What the Black Pearl really is... is freedom. Jack... It must be really terrible for you to be trapped on this island. Oh, yes. But the company is infinitely better than last time. And the scenery has definitely improved. Mr. Sparrow! I'm not entirely sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk. I know exactly what you mean, love. To freedom! To the Black Pearl! No! Not good! Stop! Not good! What are you doing? You've burned all the food, the shade, the rum. - Yes, the rum is gone. - Why is the rum gone? One, because it is a vile drink that turns respectable men into scoundrels. Two, that signal is over 1,000 feet high. The entire Royal Navy is looking for me. Do you think there is the slightest chance they won't see it? But why is the rum gone? Just wait, Captain Sparrow. You give it one hour, maybe two, keep a weather eye open, and you will see white sails on that horizon. ""Must've been terrible for you to be trapped here, Jack."" Well, it bloody is now! There'll be no living with her after this. - But we've got to save Will. - No. You're safe now. We will return to Port Royal immediately, not go gallivanting after pirates. Then we condemn him to death. The boy's fate is regrettable, but so is his decision to engage in piracy. To rescue me. To prevent anything from happening to me. If I may be so bold as to interject my professional opinion. The Pearl was listing to scuppers after the battle. She won't make good time. Think about it. The Black Pearl. The last real pirate threat in the Caribbean, mate. How can you pass that up? By remembering that I serve others, Mr. Sparrow, not only myself. Commodore, I beg you, please do this for me. As a wedding gift. Elizabeth? Are you accepting the Commodore's proposal? I am. A wedding. I love weddings. Drinks all around! I know. ""Clap him in irons,"" right? Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany these fine men to the helm and provide us with a bearing to Isla de Muerta. Then contemplate all possible meanings of the phrase ""silent as the grave"". - Do I make myself clear? - Inescapably clear. Shiver me timbers. Cotton here says you missed a bit. You knew William Turner. Old Bootstrap Bill, we knew him. Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all. Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all. He said it wasn't right with the Code. That's why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you. He said we deserved to be cursed, and remain cursed. - Stupid blighter. - Good man. But, as you can imagine, that didn't sit too well with the Captain. That didn't sit too well with the Captain at all. - Tell him what Barbossa did. - I'm telling the story! So what the captain did, he strapped a cannon to Bootstrap's bootstraps. Bootstrap's bootstraps! Last we saw of old Bill Turner, he was sinking into the crushin' black oblivion of Davy Jones' locker! It was only after that we learned we needed his blood to lift the curse. That's what you call ironic. Bring him. I don't care for the situation. Any attempt to storm the caves could turn into an ambush. Not if you're the one doing the ambushing. I go in and get Barbossa to send his men out in their little boats. Your mates return to the Dauntless and blast them with your cannons. What do you have to lose? Nothing I'd lament being rid of. Now, to be honest, there's a risk to those aboard the Dauntless, which includes the future Mrs. Commodore. - It's for your own safety. - I don't care, I have to tell him! The pirates are cursed! They can't be killed! He's already informed of that. A mermaid flopped up on deck and told the story. This is Jack Sparrow's doing! No reason to fret. A prick of the finger, a few drops of blood... No mistakes this time. He's only half-Turner. We spill it all! Guess there is reason to fret. - Beg your pardon. - Begun by blood. By blood... Jack! - It's not possible. - Not probable. Where's Elizabeth? Safe, like I promised. She's set to marry Norrington, like she promised, and you get to die for her like you promised. So we're all men of our word, except for Elizabeth, who is a woman. Shut up! You're next! - You don't want to be doing that. - No, I think I do. Your funeral. - Why don't I want to be doing it? - Because... The HMS Dauntless, pride of the Royal Navy, is floating just offshore waiting for you. What are we doing here? The pirates come out, unprepared and unawares. We catch 'em in a crossfire and send 'em down to see Old Hob. I meant, why aren't we doing what Mr. Sparrow said we should do? - With the cannons and all? - Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it. You think he wasn't telling the truth? Hear me out, mate. Order your men to row out to the Dauntless, they do what they do best, Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt... There you are with two ships. The makings of your own fleet. You'll take the grandest as your flagship and who's to argue? But what of the Pearl? Name me captain, I'll sail under your colors and give you 10% of me plunder and you get to introduce yourself as Commodore Barbossa. Savvy? And in exchange you want me not to kill the whelp. Not at all. By all means, kill the whelp. Just not yet. Wait to lift the curse until the opportune moment. For instance... after you've killed Norrington's men. Every... last... one. You've planned this ever since you learned my name. Yeah. I want 50% of your plunder. I'll buy you the hat. A really big one. Commodore. We have an accord. All hands to the boats! Apologies. You give the orders. Gents... take a walk! Not to the boats? Hold fire. This is like what the Greeks done at Troy. Except they was in a horse, instead of dresses. Wooden horse. A moment, please. Elizabeth? I want you to know I believe you made a very good decision today. Couldn't be more proud of you. But a good decision, if made for the wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision. Lieutenant. Elizabeth? Are you there? Are you even listening to me? What have you done? Stop that! I already feel like a fool. You look nice, though. I look nice? I must admit, Jack, I thought I had you figured but it turns out you're a hard man to predict. I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can trust to be dishonest. Honestly, it's the honest ones you want to watch out for. You can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly... stupid. You're off the edge of the map, mate. Here there be monsters! Right. What would you eat first? We should decide now so we're ready when the time comes. What was that? Miss Elizabeth! Make for the ship! Move! To the ship! Row, men! You can't beat me, Jack. That's interesting. I couldn't resist, mate. Sorry! What now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be two immortals, locked in an epic battle until Judgment Day? Or you could surrender. All of you with me. Will is in that cave and we must save him. Ready, and... heave! I need your help. Come on! Any port in a storm. Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl. - Are you gonna leave Jack? - Jack owes us a ship. - There's the Code to consider. - The Code? You're pirates. Hang the Code and hang the rules! They're more like guidelines. Bloody pirates! Is it supposed to be doing that? They're stealing our ship. Bloody pirates! Boarders away. Come on! Me eye! I'll teach you the meaning of pain. You like pain? Try wearing a corset. Whose side is Jack on? At the moment? No fair! Ten years you carry that pistol and now you waste your shot. He didn't waste it. I feel... cold. Parley? - The ship is ours, gentlemen. - Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! We should return to the Dauntless. Your fianc will want to know you're safe. If you were waiting for the opportune moment... that was it. Now, I'd be much obliged if you'd drop me off at my ship. I'm sorry, Jack. They done what's right by them. Can't expect more than that. Jack Sparrow... Captain Jack Sparrow. ...for your crimes against the Crown. Said crimes being numerous in quantity and sinister in nature. The most egregious of these to be cited herewith: Piracy, smuggling... This is wrong. Commodore Norrington is bound by the law, as are we all. ...impersonating an officer of the Spanish Royal Navy, impersonating a cleric of the Church of England, sailing under false colors, arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching, brigandage, pilfering, depravity, depredation and general lawlessness. For these crimes, you are sentenced to be hung by the neck until dead. May God have mercy on your soul. Governor Swann. Commodore. Elizabeth. I should have told you every day from the moment I met you... I love you. Watch yourself! Marines! I can't breathe. Elizabeth! Move! I thought we might have to endure some ill-conceived escape attempt, but not from you. On our return to Port Royal, I granted you clemency. And this is how you thank me? By throwing in your lot with him? - He's a pirate. - And a good man. If this means the hangman will earn two pairs of boots instead of one, so be it. My conscience will be clear. You forget your place, Turner. It's right here, between you and Jack. - As is mine. - Elizabeth. Lower your weapons. Put them down! So this is where your heart truly lies? It is. I'm feeling good about this. We've all arrived at a special place. Spiritually, ecumenically, grammatically. I want you to know that I was rooting for you, mate. Know that. Elizabeth. It would never have worked between us, darling. I'm sorry. Will. Nice hat. Friends. This is the day that you will always remember as the day that... Idiot. He's nowhere to go but back to the noose. Sail ho! What's your plan of action? Sir! Perhaps on the rare occasion, pursuing the right course demands an act of piracy. Piracy itself can be the right course. Mr. Turner. I will accept the consequences of my actions. This is a beautiful sword. I expect the man who made it to show the same care and devotion in every aspect of his life. Thank you. Commodore! What about Sparrow? I think we can afford to give him one day's head start. So... This is the path you've chosen, is it? After all, he is a blacksmith. No. He's a pirate. Thought you were supposed to keep to the Code? We figured they were more actual... guidelines. Thank you. Captain Sparrow. The Black Pearl is yours. On deck, you scabrous dogs! Hands to braces! Let go and haul to run free! Now... bring me that horizon. And really bad eggs Drink up, me hearties. Yo ho!, Towels. Lord Miraz? You have a son. The heavens have blessed us. You know your orders. General Glozelle? Yes, my lord. Five more minutes. Won't be watching the stars tonight, my prince. Come. We must hurry. - Professor, what's going on? - Your aunt has given birth... ...to a son. Come. You must make for the woods. - The woods? - They won't follow you there. It has taken me many years to find this. Do not use it except at your greatest need. Will I ever see you again? I dearly hope so, my prince. There is so much more I meant to tell you. Everything you know is about to change. Close the drawbridge! Now, go. - Halt! - Halt! A son! A son! Lady Prunaprismia has this night given Lord Miraz a son! Which of you superstitious old women wants to spend the night in a cell? He's seen us. Take care of him. No! - Mind yourself, love. - I'm sorry. Watch where you're going! Wait for me! You go to Saint Finbar's? That's right. I go to Hendon House. Across the road. I've seen you... ...sitting by yourself. Yes, well, I prefer to be left alone. Me, too. What's your name? - Phyllis. - Susan! You'd better come quickly. Paper here! Get your daily paper! Edmund! Go on! Kick him in the face! Stop it. Break it up. That's enough. Come on. That's it. Get up. Act your age! - You're welcome. - I had it sorted. What was it this time? - He bumped me. - So you hit him? No. After he bumped me, they tried to make me apologize. - That's when I hit him. - Really? - Is it that hard just to walk away? - I shouldn't have to. I mean, don't you ever get tired of being treated like a kid? We are kids. Well, I wasn't always. It's been a year. How long does he expect us to wait? I think it's time to accept that we live here. It's no use pretending any different. Oh, no. - Pretend you're talking to me. - We are talking to you. - Quiet, Lu. - Something pinched me! - Stop pulling! - Not touching you. Look, would all of you just... What is that? - It feels like magic. - Everyone hold hands. - I'm not holding your hand! - Just... Shame you're not as quick as me, Ed! Last one in's a rotten egg. Watch out! Here it comes! Wait a minute! Come on, Susan. Hurry up! Come on, it's lovely. Edmund. Ed? Ed! - What is it? - Where do you suppose we are? Well, where do you think? Well, I don't remember any ruins in Narnia. Wonder who lived here. I think we did. Hey, that's mine. - From my chess set. - Which chess set? I didn't exactly have a solid gold chess set in Finchley, did I? Can't be. - Don't you see? - What? Imagine walls. And columns, there. And a glass roof. Cair Paravel. Wait. Wait, my lord. It is not what you think. Then what is it? We're not exactly sure. Impossible. I warned this council when it put its trust in Lord Miraz... ...there would be consequences. - No. We can't accuse the Lord Protector without proof. How long are we going to hide behind that excuse? Until every chair in this chamber is empty? Lords of the council, my apologies for being late. I wasn't aware we were in session. No doubt you were otherwise occupied. My lord? Ever since the death of Caspian the ninth, you've behaved as if you were king. Now it seems that from behind his walls even Prince Caspian has gone missing. My deepest condolences, Lord Miraz. Imagine, losing your nephew, the rightful heir to the throne, on the very night your wife has blessed you with a son. Thank you, Lord Sopespian. Your compassion is a boon in this troubled time. I trust you can tell us how such a tragedy could have occurred. That is the most disturbing news of all. Our beloved Caspian was abducted... ...by Narnians. You go too far, Miraz. Expect us to stand by while you blame such a blatant crime on fairy tales? What? We forget, my lords, Narnia was once a savage land. Fierce creatures roamed free. Much of our forefathers' blood was shed to exterminate this vermin. Or so we thought. But while we've been bickering amongst ourselves... ...they've been breeding like cockroaches under a rock! Growing stronger. Watching us. Waiting to strike! And you wonder why we don't like you. Well, I intend to strike back. Even if I have to cut down the entire forest, I assure you, I will find Prince Caspian and finish what our ancestors began. - Catapults. - What? This didn't just happen. Cair Paravel was attacked. Don't suppose you have any matches, do you? No, but... ...would this help? You might have mentioned that a bit sooner. I can't believe it. It's all still here. I was so tall. Well, you were older then. As opposed to hundreds of years later... when you're younger. - What is it? - My horn. I must've left it on my saddle the day we went back. When Aslan bares his teeth, winter meets its death. When he shakes his mane... ...we shall have spring again. Everyone we knew... Mr. Tumnus and the Beavers... ...they're all gone. I think it's time we found out what's going on. He won't stop staring. So don't look. Here's far enough. Drop him! Crows and crockery! ""Drop him""! That's the best you can come up with? A simple ""thank you"" would suffice. They were doing fine drowning me without your help. Maybe we should have let them. Why were they trying to kill you, anyway? They're Telmarines. That's what they do. Telmarines? In Narnia? Where have you been for the last few hundred years? It's a bit of a long story. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. You're it? You're the kings and queens of old? High King Peter, the Magnificent. You probably could've left off the last bit. Probably. You might be surprised. You don't want to do that, boy. Not me. Him. Edmund! You all right? Beards and bedsteads! Maybe that horn worked after all. What horn? This bread is so stale. I'll just get him some soup. He should be coming around soon. I don't think I hit him hard enough. Nikabrik, he's just a boy. He's a Telmarine, not some lost puppy. You said you were gonna get rid of him. No. I said I'd take care of him. We can't kill him now. I just bandaged his head. It would be like murdering a guest. How do you think his friends are treating their guest? Trumpkin knew what he was doing. It's not the boy's fault. Stop! Stop! Hold it. No, no! I told you we should have killed him when we had the chance. - You know why we can't. - If we're taking a vote, I'm with him. We can't let him go. He's seen us. That's enough, Nikabrik! Or do I have to sit on your head again? And you. Look what you made me do. I spent half the morning on that soup. What are you? You know, it's funny that you would ask that. You think people would know a badger when they saw one. No. No, I mean... ...you're Narnians. You're supposed to be extinct. Sorry to disappoint you. Here you go. Still hot. Since when did we open a boarding house for Telmarine soldiers? I'm not a soldier. I am Prince Caspian. The tenth. What are you doing here? Running away. My uncle has always wanted my throne. I suppose I have only lived this long because he did not have an heir of his own. - Well, that changes things. - Yeah. Means we don't have to kill you ourselves. You're right. - Where are you going? - My uncle won't stop until I am dead. But you can't leave. You're meant to save us. Don't you know what this is? You have quite a library, doctor. Is there anything particular you seek, my lord? I think I've already found what I'm looking for... ...in one of my soldiers! What do you know of Queen Susan's horn? It was said to be magic. Magic? The Narnians believed it could summon their kings and queens of old. At least, such was the superstition. And what does Caspian know of this superstition? My lord, you forbade me from mentioning the old tales. So I did. I will say this. If Caspian does know of the Deep Magic, my lord would have good reason to be nervous. First our prince... ...now his tutor. If the members of Miraz's own house are not safe, - are any of us? - Lord Sopespian! Those are dangerous words, Lord Sopespian. But these are dangerous times, general. One should choose his words as carefully as he chooses his friends. How long until the bridge is finished? - Construction continues on schedule. - That's not good enough. I need my army across that river now. May I suggest you contribute some of your own men? I've only so many at my disposal. A fact you'd be wise to remember. Go to Beruna. Take as many troops as you need. We must get to Caspian before they do. ""They,"" my lord? It's time you learned your history. They're so still. They're trees. What'd you expect? They used to dance. Wasn't long after you left that the Telmarines invaded. Those who survived retreated to the woods. And the trees, they retreated so deep into themselves that they haven't been heard from since. I don't understand. How could Aslan have let this happen? Aslan? Thought he abandoned us when you lot did. We didn't mean to leave, you know. Makes no difference now, does it? Get us to the Narnians... ...and it will. Hello, there. It's all right. We're friends. Don't move, Your Majesty. Stay away from her! Shoot, Susan! Shoot! - Why wouldn't he stop? - I suspect he was hungry. Thanks. He was wild. I don't think he could talk at all. Get treated like a dumb animal long enough, that's what you become. You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember. I can hear you. I just think we should wait for the kings and queens. Fine! Go then! See if the others will be as understanding! Or maybe I'll come with you. I want to see you explain things to the minotaurs. Minotaurs? They're real? And very bad-tempered. - Yeah, not to mention big. - Huge. What about centaurs? Do they still exist? Well, the centaurs will probably fight on your side. But there's no telling what the others will do. What about Aslan? How do you know so much about us? - Stories. - Wait a minute. Your father told you stories about Narnia? No, my professor, he... Listen, I'm sorry. These are not the kind of questions you should be asking. - What is it? - Human. - Him? - No. Them. - There they are! - Run! Now! - Oh, no. - Wait. I'll go. Take it. Go! It's more important than I am. Get him out of here. Where are you? Choose your last words carefully, Telmarine. You are a mouse. I was hoping for something a little more original. Pick up your sword. No, thanks. Pick it up! I will not fight an unarmed man. Which is why I might live longer if I choose not to cross blades with you, noble mouse. I said I would not fight you. I didn't say I'd let you live! Reepicheep! - Stay your blade! - Trufflehunter? I trust you have a very good reason for this untimely interruption. - He doesn't. Go ahead. - He's the one who blew the horn. - What? - Then let him bring it forward. This is the reason we have gathered. I don't remember this way. That's the problem with girls. You can't carry a map in your heads. That's because our heads have something in them. I wish he'd just listen to the D.L.F. in the first place. - D.L. F? - Dear Little Friend. Oh, that's not at all patronizing, is it? I'm not lost. No. You're just going the wrong way. You last saw Caspian at the Shuddering Woods, and the quickest way there is to cross at the river Rush. But unless I'm mistaken, there's no crossing in these parts. That explains it, then. You're mistaken. You see, over time, water erodes the earth's soil, carving deeper... Oh, shut up. - Is there a way down? - Yeah, falling. Well, we weren't lost. There's a ford near Beruna. How do you feel about swimming? I'd rather that than walking. Aslan? It's Aslan! It's Aslan over there! Don't you see? He's right... ...there. Do you see him now? I'm not crazy. He was there. He wanted us to follow him. I'm sure there are any number of lions in this wood. - Just like that bear. - I think I know Aslan when I see him. Look, I'm not about to jump off a cliff after someone who doesn't exist. The last time I didn't believe Lucy I ended up looking pretty stupid. Why wouldn't I have seen him? Maybe you weren't looking. I'm sorry, Lu. Kill him! - Telmarine! - Liar! Murderer! All this horn proves is they've stolen yet another thing from us! - I didn't steal anything. - Didn't steal anything? Shall we list the things the Telmarines have taken? - Our homes! - Our land! - Our freedom! - Our lives! You stole Narnia! You would hold me accountable for all the crimes of my people? Accountable... ...and punishable. That is rich coming from you, dwarf. Have you forgotten it was your people who fought alongside the White Witch? And I'd gladly do it again, if it would rid us of these barbarians. Then it's lucky that it is not in your power to bring her back. Or are you suggesting that we ask this boy to go against Aslan now? Some of you may have forgotten, but we badgers remember well, that Narnia was never right except when a Son of Adam was king. He's a Telmarine! Why would we want him as our king? Because I can help you. - It's a trick! - At least hear him out! Beyond these woods, I'm a prince. The Telmarine throne is rightfully mine! Help me claim it, and I can bring peace between us. It is true. The time is ripe. I watch the skies, for it is mine to watch as it is yours to remember, badger. Tarva, the lord of victory, and Alambil, the lady of peace, have come together in the high heavens. And now here, a Son of Adam has come forth... ...to offer us back our freedom. Is this possible? Do you really think there could be peace? Do you? I mean, really? Two days ago, I didn't believe in the existence of talking animals... ...or dwarves... or centaurs. Yet here you are in strength and numbers that we Telmarines could never have imagined. Whether this horn is magic or not, it brought us together. And together, we have a chance to take back what is ours. If you will lead us, then my sons and I... ...offer you our swords. And we offer you our lives, unreservedly. Miraz's army will not be far behind us, sire. If we are to be ready for them, we need to hurry to find soldiers and weapons. I'm sure they will be here soon. These ones! And these ones! Timber! - Get back! - Watch your back! Look out! - Steady, steady! - Timber! Perhaps this wasn't the best way to come after all. So where exactly do you think you saw Aslan? I wish you'd all stop trying to sound like grown-ups. I don't think I saw him, I did see him. I am a grown-up. It was right over... Lucy! ...here. Lucy, are you awake? Why do you think I didn't see Aslan? You believe me? Well, we got across the gorge. I don't know. Maybe you didn't really want to. You always knew we'd be coming back here, didn't you? I hoped so. I finally just got used to the idea of being in England. But you're happy to be here, aren't you? While it lasts. Lucy. Lucy. Aslan! I've missed you so much! - You've grown. - Every year you grow... ...so shall I. Where have you been? Why haven't you come to help us? Things never happen the same way twice, dear one. Susan! Wake up! Certainly, Lu. Whatever you like. Wake up. Aslan? No, stop! Prince Caspian? Yes? And who are you? Peter! - High King Peter. - I believe you called. Well, yes, but... I thought you'd be older. If you like, we could come back in a few years... No. No, that's all right. You're just... You're not exactly what I expected. Neither are you. A common enemy unites even the oldest of foes. We have anxiously awaited your return, my liege. Our hearts and swords are at your service. Oh, my gosh, he is so cute. - Who said that? - Sorry. Your Majesty, with the greatest respect, I do believe ""courageous,"" ""courteous,"" or ""chivalrous"" might more befit a knight of Narnia. Well, at least we know some of you can handle a blade. Yes, indeed. And I have recently put it to good use, securing weapons for your army, sire. Good. Because we're going to need every sword we can get. Well, then, you will probably be wanting yours back. How much did they take? Enough weapons and armor for two regiments. But... there's more. ""You were right to fear the woods."" - ""X""? - Caspian. The tenth. I apologize, my lord. The blame is mine. I know. Tell me, general... ...how many men did you lose? - None, my lord. - None? They came like ghosts, in the dead of night. We never saw them. Then how do you explain your injuries? I asked... ...how many men were killed during this bloody Narnian attack? Of which you were a fortunate survivor. General... ...how many? Three. I apologize, Lord Sopespian. Caspian is not a victim of this savage uprising. He is the instigator. It seems Narnia is in need of a new king. Well, it's good you have troops, but we need some fortifications. Somewhere to train. So? What are they like? Malcontents, complainers, stubborn as mules in the morning. So you like them, then. Well enough. It may not be what you are used to, but it is defensible. Peter. You may want to see this. It's us. What is this place? You don't know? He must know what he's doing. I think it's up to us now. It's only a matter of time. Miraz's men and war machines are on their way. That means those same men aren't protecting his castle. What do you propose we do, Your Majesty? - We need to get ready for it. - To start planning for... Our only hope is to strike them before they strike us. Crazy. No one has taken that castle. - There's always a first time. - We'll have the element of surprise. - But we have the advantage here! - If we dig in, we could probably hold them off indefinitely. I, for one, feel safer underground. Look. I appreciate what you've done here, but this isn't a fortress. It's a tomb. Yes. And if they're smart, the Telmarines will just wait and starve us out. - We could collect nuts! - Yes! And throw them at the Telmarines. Shut up! I think you know where I stand, sire. If I get your troops in, can you handle the guards? Or die trying, my liege. - That's what I'm worried about. - Sorry? You're all acting like there's only two options. Dying here, or dying there. - I'm not sure you've been listening. - No, you're not listening. Or have you forgotten who really defeated the White Witch, Peter? I think we've waited for Aslan long enough. Professor? - I have to find him. - You don't have time. - You need to get the gate open. - You wouldn't be here without him. And neither would I. You and I can deal with Miraz. And I can still get to the gate in time. Yes, I'm a mouse. We were expecting someone, you know, taller. - You're one to talk. - Is that supposed to be irony? Five more minutes? What are you doing here? I didn't help you escape just so you could break back in. You have to get out before Miraz learns you're here. He's going to learn soon enough. We are giving him your cell. Don't underestimate Miraz as your father did. What are you talking about? I'm sorry. Thank goodness you're safe. Get up. - Caspian? - Stay where you are. - What are you doing? - I should think it's obvious, dear. You know, some families might consider this inappropriate behavior. That doesn't seem to have stopped you! But you are not like me, are you? It's sad. The first time you've shown any backbone... ...and it's such a waste. Put the sword down, Caspian. - I don't want to do this. - We don't want you to either. This used to be a private room. What are you doing? You're supposed to be in the gatehouse! No! Tonight for once, I want the truth. Did you kill my father? Now we get to it. You said your brother died in his sleep. That was more or less true. Caspian, this won't make things any better. We Telmarines would have nothing had we not taken it. Your father knew that as well as anyone. How could you? For the same reason you will pull that trigger. - For our son. - Stop! - Stay right there. - You need to make a choice, dear. Do you want our child to be king? Or do you want him to be like Caspian here? - Fatherless! - No! Caspian! What's that supposed to mean? - We're under attack! - Sound the alarm! Men! Grab your bows! - Peter! - Our troops are just outside! Come on! Now, Ed! Now! - Signal the troops! - I'm a bit busy, Pete! Peter! It's too late. We have to call it off while we can. No, I can still do this! Help me! Exactly who are you doing this for, Peter? Come on! Charge! We're under attack! Attack! Attack! For Narnia! Archers! Pick a target! Take aim! Ed! Get that gate closed. Fall back! We need to retreat! Now! Go! Get her out of here! Back to the gate! Go! - Caspian! - I'll find him! Go! Get out! Go! Get out! Retreat! Follow me! Give the order. My men are still down there. Draw back! Get out! Retreat! Now! Fire! Run for your life! Save yourself! Peter! The bridge! Leave us! Go, brothers! In the name of Aslan! What happened? Ask him. - Peter. - Me? You could've called it off. There was still time. No, there wasn't, thanks to you. If you kept to the plan, those soldiers might be alive. If you'd stayed here like I suggested, they definitely would be! - You called us, remember? - My first mistake. No. Your first mistake was thinking you could lead these people. I am not the one who abandoned Narnia. You invaded Narnia. You have no more right to lead it than Miraz does. You, him, your father... Narnia's better off without the lot of you. Stop it! What are you all standing around for? Telmarines will be here soon enough. Thank you... my dear little friend. - Well done, lads. - Move it faster, mate. Too slow! Beruna pledges its troops. Galma pledges its troops. Tashbaan pledges its troops. Ettinsmoor pledges its troops. Long live the king! Long live the king! Are you so glad of that magic horn now, boy? Your kings and queens have failed us. Your army's half dead. And those that aren't will be soon enough. What do you want? Congratulations? You want your uncle's blood. So do we. You want his throne? We can get it for you. You tried one ancient power. It failed. But there is a power greater still. One that kept even Aslan at bay for near a hundred years. Who's there? I am hunger. I am thirst. I can fast a hundred years... ...and not die. I can lie a hundred nights on the ice... ...and not freeze. I can drink a river of blood and not burst. Show me... your enemies! What you hate, so will we. No one hates better than us. And you can... guarantee Miraz's death? And more. Let the circle be drawn. Wait. This isn't what I wanted. One drop of Adam's blood and you free me. Then I am yours, my king. No! Stop! Come on! Come. Get away from him! Peter, dear. I've missed you. Come. Just one drop. You know you can't do this alone. I know. You had it sorted. Why did you never tell me about my father? My mother was a Black Dwarf from the Northern Mountains. I risked my life all these years so that one day... ...you might be a better king than those before you. Then I have failed you. Everything I told you, everything I didn't, it was only because I believe in you. You have a chance to become the most noble contradiction in history. The Telmarine who saved Narnia. You're lucky, you know. What do you mean? To have seen him. I wish he'd just given me some sort of proof. Maybe we're the ones who need to prove ourselves to him. Pete. You'd better come quickly. Cakes and kettledrums. That's your next big plan? Sending a little girl into the darkest parts of the forest? Alone! - It's our only chance. - And she won't be alone. Haven't enough of us died already? Nikabrik was my friend too. But he lost hope. Queen Lucy hasn't. And neither have I. For Aslan. For Aslan! - Then I'm going with you. - No. We need you here. We have to hold them off until Lucy and Susan get back. If I may... Miraz may be a tyrant and a murderer... ...but as king, he is subject to the traditions... ...and expectations of his people. There is one in particular that may buy us some time. Perhaps they intend to surrender. No. They are much too noble for that. ""I, Peter, by the gift of Aslan, by election and by conquest, High King of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel and emperor of the Lone Islands, in order to prevent the abominable effusion of blood, do hereby challenge the usurper Miraz to single combat upon the field of battle. The fight shall be to the death. The reward shall be total surrender."" - Tell me, Prince Edmund... - King. - Pardon me? - It's King Edmund, actually. Just ""King,"" though. Peter's the high king. I know, it's confusing. Why would we risk such a proposal when our armies could wipe you out by nightfall? Haven't you already underestimated our numbers? I mean, only a week ago Narnians were extinct. And so you will be again. Well, then you should have little to fear. This is not a question of bravery. So you're bravely refusing to fight a swordsman half your age? I didn't say I refused. You shall have our support, Your Majesty. Whatever your decision. Sire, our military advantage alone provides the perfect excuse to avoid - what might otherwise be... - I'm not avoiding anything! I was merely pointing out that my lord is well within his rights to refuse. His Majesty would never refuse. He relishes the chance to show the people the courage of their new king. You. You should hope your brother's sword is sharper than his pen. Destrier has always served me well. You are in good hands. Or hooves. - Good luck. - Thanks. Look. Maybe it is time you had this back. Why don't you hold on to it. You might need to call me again. - You might need to call me again? - Oh, shut up. If it should appear to be going poorly... Understood, Your Majesty. I hope you won't be too disappointed when I survive. There is still time to surrender. Well, feel free. How many more must die for the throne? Just one. - Ride! - They've seen us! - Take the reins. - What are you doing? I'm sorry, Lucy. But it looks as if you'll be going alone after all. Are you sure you don't need that horn? Does His Highness need a respite? Five minutes? Three! Lucy? She got through... with a little help. - Thanks. - Well, you were busy. I assume you won't let things get that close again! You better get up there. Just in case. I don't expect the Telmarines will keep their word. - Sorry. - It's all right. Be careful. Keep smiling. How does he look to you? Young. But His Majesty's doing extremely well... for his age. I think it's dislocated. What do you think happens back home if you die here? You know you've always been there, and I never really... Save it for later. Respite! Respite. Now's not the time for chivalry, Peter! Show no mercy! Look out! What's the matter, boy? Too cowardly to take a life? It's not mine to take. Perhaps I was wrong. Maybe you do have the makings of a Telmarine king after all. Not one like you. Keep your life. But I am giving the Narnians back their kingdom. My king. I'll deal with you when this is over. It is over. Treachery! They shot him! They murdered our king! Be ready! Peter! Go! To arms, Telmar! To arms! Loose! Cavalry! Attack! Archers to the ready! Narnians! Charge! One, two... Three, four... Five, six... Take your aim! Stay with them! Eight, nine... Get ready! Now! Stop! Back! Back! Hold it now! Hold it! Now! Charge! Charge! You're a mouse. You people have no imagination. Loose! Loose! Lucy? Back to the How! Cut off their escape! Loose! Loose! Brace yourselves! Back to the How! Crush them all. Aslan! I knew it was you. The whole time, I knew it. But the others didn't believe me. And why would that stop you from coming to me? I'm sorry. I was too scared to come alone. Why wouldn't you show yourself? Why couldn't you come roaring in and save us like last time? Things never happen the same way twice, dear one. If I'd have come earlier, would everyone who died... could I have stopped that? We can never know what would have happened, Lucy. But what will happen is another matter entirely. - You mean you'll help? - Of course. - As will you. - Oh, I wish I was braver. If you were any braver, you'd be a lioness. Now, I think your friends have slept long enough, don't you? Come on! Lucy. For Aslan! We can defeat them if we draw them to the river. We must regroup. To Beruna! To the bridge! Charge! What is happening? - The river! - Retreat! Back! Back! Come on. Assemble on that bank! You will not be harmed! Surrender your weapons! Take off the armor! Rise, kings and queens of Narnia. All of you. I do not think I am ready. It's for that very reason I know you are. Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you. Hail, Aslan! It is a great honor to be in... I'm completely out of countenance. I must crave your indulgence for appearing in this unseemly fashion. Perhaps a drop more? - I don't think it does that. - You could have a go. It becomes you well, small one. All the same, great king, I regret that I must withdraw, for a tail is the honor and glory of a mouse. Perhaps you think too much of your honor, friend. Well, it's not just the honor. It's also great for balance. And climbing. And grabbing things. May it please Your High Majesty, we will not bear the shame of wearing an honor denied to our chief. Not for the sake of your dignity, but for the love of your people. Look! Thank you, my liege. I will treasure it always. From this day forward it will serve as a great reminder of my huge humility. Now, where is this dear little friend you've told me so much about? Do you see him now? Because you have snuck in... I'm sorry, but their future in that world shall be good. Your Majesty? We are ready. Everyone has assembled. Narnia belongs to the Narnians, just as it does to man. Any Telmarines who want to stay and live in peace are welcome to. But for any of you who wish, Aslan will return you to the home of our forefathers. It's been generations since we left Telmar. We're not referring to Telmar. Your ancestors were seafaring brigands. Pirates run aground on an island. There they found a cave, a rare chasm that brought them here from their world. The same world as our kings and queens. It is to that island I can return you. It is a good place for any who wish to make a new start. I will go. I will accept the offer. So will we. Because you have spoken first, your future in that world shall be good. - Where did they go? - They killed them. How do we know he is not leading us to our death? Sire. If my example can be of any service, I will take 11 mice through with no delay. - We'll go. - We will? Come on. Our time's up. After all... ...we're not really needed here anymore. I will look after it until you return. I'm afraid that's just it. We're not coming back. We're not? You two are. At least, I think he means you two. But why? - Did they do something wrong? - Quite the opposite, dear one. But all things have their time. Your brother and sister have learned what they can from this world. Now it's time for them to live in their own. It's all right, Lu. It's not how I thought it would be... ...but it's all right. One day you'll see, too. Come on. I'm glad I came back. I wish we had more time together. It would never have worked, anyway. Why not? I am 1,300 years older than you. I'm sure when I'm older I'll understand. I'm older and don't think I want to understand. Aren't you coming, Phyllis? You don't think there's any way we can get back? I've left my new torch in Narnia. Subtitles by LeapinLar, See you tomorrow. Oh, my God! I'm in. We're almost there. -Sir, are you sure about this? -I told you, we're going to be all right. I understand, sir. It's just that... ...I'm scoping some serious sentinel activity up here. -Link. -Yes, sir? Given your situation, I can't say I understand your reasons... ...for volunteering to operate onboard my ship. However, if you wish to continue to do so, I must ask you to do one thing. What's that, sir? To trust me. Yes, sir. I will, sir. -I mean, I do, sir. -I hope so. Repatch the main AC to the hard drives and stand by to broadcast. Yes, sir. Still can't sleep? You wanna talk? They're just dreams. If you're afraid of something.... I just wish.... I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do. That's all. I just wish I knew. She's gonna call. Don't worry. Here you are. -Are we ready to go? -We're already late. These geotherms confirm the last transmission of the Osiris. The machines are digging. They're boring from the surface down to Zion. -Mother-- -They'll avoid the perimeter defense. How fast are they moving? Control estimates their descent at 1 00 meters an hour. -How deep are they? -Almost 2000 meters. -What about the scans from the Osiris? -They can't be accurate. -They may be. -It's not possible. That'd mean there are a quarter-million sentinels. -That's right. -That can't be. Why not? A sentinel for every man, woman and child in Zion. That sounds exactly like the thinking of a machine to me. Morpheus, glad you could join us. Niobe. My apologies to all. But as you are undoubtedly aware... ...it's become difficult to locate a secure broadcast position. -Squiddies got our best spots. -Lines are crawling with them. And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours there's gonna be a quarter-million more. What are we gonna do? We're gonna do what Commander Lock ordered. We'll evacuate broadcast level and return to Zion. And does the commander have a plan for stopping 250,000 sentinels? A strategy is still being formulated. I' m sure it is. What do you think we should do, Morpheus? -We should proceed as ordered... -What is it? I don't know. ...however, I must ask one of you for help. Some of you believe as I believe, some of you do not. Those of you that do... ...know we are nearing the end of our struggle. The prophecy will be fulfilled soon. But before it can be... ...the Oracle must be consulted. If we return and recharge now... ...we can be back in 36 hours, well before the machines reach this depth. Do you understand what you're asking? I am asking that one ship remain here in our place... ...in case the Oracle should attempt to contact us. Bullshit. You're asking one of us to disobey a direct order. That's right, I am. But we well know that the reason most of us are here... ...is because of our affinity for disobedience. What happens when you get back to Zion... ...and the commander throws you in the stockade? He won't. Goddamn it, Morpheus, you ain't never gonna change. Shit, I'll do it just to see what Deadbolt does to you. You got 36 hours. I'm looking for Neo. -Never heard of him. -I have something for him. A gift. You see, he set me free. Fine, whatever. Now piss off. -Who was that? -How did you know someone was here? He gave you this. He said you set him free. Is everything all right, sir? The meeting is over. Retreat to your exits. -Agents are coming. -Agents? Go. Hiya, fellas. -It's him. -The anomaly. -Do we proceed? -Yes. -He is still-- -Only human. Upgrades. -That went as expected. -Yes. It's happening exactly as before. Well, not exactly. -What happened? -I can't figure it out. Agents just came out of nowhere. Then the code got all weird. Encryption I've never seen. -ls Neo okay? -Okay? Shit, you should've seen him. Where is he now? He's doing his Superman thing. Where are you? This is the Nebuchadnezzar, requesting access through Gate Three. Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control. Maintain present velocity and stand by. Roger that, Control. This is Control requesting immediate stand-down of arms at Gate Three. We have the Nebuchadnezzar on approach. Let's open her up. You are cleared through Gate Three to Bay Seven. Roger that, Control. Door's open, bed's made. Welcome home. No place like it. Roger that, Control. Zion Control, stand by for Gate Three lockdown. The Nebuchadnezzar is down. Bay Seven. Understood. Captain Mifune. Captain Morpheus. Are you here to escort me to the stockade, captain? -l' m just here to keep the peace. -Commander Lock demands-- Requests your immediate counsel, sir. -Link. -Sir? I want the ship ready to go as soon as possible. Understood, sir. -What is it between them? -Morpheus and Lock? -Niobe. -Captain Niobe? She used to be with Morpheus. Now she's with Lock. What happened? Morpheus went to the Oracle. After that, everything changed. Yeah, she can do that. Neo! -Oh, no. -How does he always know? Doesn't he have anything better to do? You know what they say about the life you save. I didn't save his life. Hiya, Neo. -Trinity, Link. -Hey. -It's great to have you back. -Thanks. It's good to be back. -Can I carry that for you? -No, I can carry my own bag. -Trinity? -I'm fine. -You can carry these. -Yeah, sure, Link. Hey, you know, next year I'm old enough to join a crew, right? I've been thinking about it, and I've made my decision. Let me guess. I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar. Morpheus hasn't filled the other positions, except for you, Link. I' m sure he has reasons... ... but the more I think about it, the more I think it's meant to be. You know, it's fate. You're the reason I'm here, Neo. I told you, you found me. I didn't find you. I know, but you got me out. You saved me. You saved yourself. -Morpheus. -Commander Lock. I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to offer you a chance to explain your actions. I wasn't aware that my actions required any explanation. You were given an order... -...to return to Zion. -I did. You asked for one ship to remain behind. I would have stayed, but I needed to recharge my ship. So you admit to a direct contravention of your duty. We need a presence inside the Matrix to await contact from the Oracle. I don't want to hear that shit! I don't care about oracles or prophecies or messiahs! I care about one thing: Stopping that army from destroying this city. T o do that I need soldiers to obey my orders. With all due respect, commander, there is only one way to save our city. How? -Neo. -Goddamn it, Morpheus. Not everyone believes what you believe. My beliefs do not require them to. There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's talking. A lot of people are scared. No one remembers the last time so many ships were docked. -Something big is happening, isn't it? -Hey. We're not allowed to say anything, so stop asking. Goddamn, it's good to be home. I'm recommending that you be removed from duty. That is, of course, your prerogative, commander. If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot on a ship for the rest of your life. Then I am grateful that it is not up to you. -Councillor Hamann. -Commander. -Captain. -Councillor. Council's asked me to speak tonight at the temple gathering. The presence of the fleet... ...and the persistence of rumors must be addressed. The people must be told what is happening. Of course, councillor. But might I advise a level of discretion concerning specific details. -We do not wish to start a panic. -Quite right. A panic is not what anyone wants. What about you, captain? What would you advise? The truth. No one will panic, because there is nothing to fear. That army won't reach the gates of Zion. -What makes you so sure? -Consider what we have seen, councillor. Consider that in the past six months... ...we have freed more minds than in six years. This attack is an act of desperation. I believe very soon the prophecy will be fulfilled and this war will end. I hope you're right, captain. I do not believe it to be a matter of hope, councillor. It is simply a matter of time. My stop. See you soon. Hopefully not too soon. Let's go, kid. These two got things to do. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I am if you're thinking this elevator is too slow. -How long do we charge the Neb? -Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours. Some people go their entire lives without hearing news that good. Neo, please, I have a son, Jacob, aboard the Gnosis. -Please, watch over him. -I'll try. I have a daughter on the Icarus. No, wait. It's all right. They need you. -I need you. -I know. There's time. Where's my puss--? -Hey! -Uncle Link! God! Uncle Link! Oh, my God! You're so huge! -You should be picking me up! -No! -Yeah! -Okay! Okay? All right. Now, we're gonna have to work together here, okay? One, two, three, lift! Oh, my God! What are you feeding these two? Come on, kids. It's time to go. -Hey, Cas. -Hey. -Good to have you home, Link. -Good to be home. You be careful with her. Don't worry about me. He's the one that's gonna get it. Out the door! Both of you, march! -Bye! -Bye! I'm gonna get what? Every ship up there's been home two... ...even three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar. Come on, Zee. I thought we were past this. -We'll be when you operate another ship. -I can't do that. -Why? -You know why. If Dozer knew how I felt, he wouldn't have asked you to do this. Maybe. But it's too late now. I made a promise, and some promises can't be unmade. -It's not fair. -Nobody said it was gonna be. You think Cas thinks it's fair that I'm here and Dozer's not? I lost two brothers to that ship, Link. I'm afraid of it. I'm afraid it's gonna take you too. It won't. How can you say that to me? Because of Morpheus. Because of what he's told me. He said that this is it, that it will be over soon. -Link, Morpheus is crazy. -No doubt. But T ank and Dozer believed him. And I'll tell you what... ...after being on that ship and seeing Neo do the things he can do... ...I gotta say... ...I'm starting to believe him too. Be careful, Link. Please be careful. They started yet? Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer. Tonight, let us honor these men and women. These are our soldiers, our warriors. These are our husbands and wives, our brothers and sisters... ...our children. Let us remember those that have been lost... ...and let us give thanks for those that have been found... ...and who stand here beside us. Now I would like someone else to close this prayer... ...someone who hasn't spoken here in a long time... ...but who I believe has something to say that we all need to hear. I give you Morpheus. Zion! Hear me! It is true what many of you have heard. The machines have gathered an army, and as I speak... ...that army is drawing nearer to our home. Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us. But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it. I stand here before you now truthfully unafraid. Why? Because I believe something you do not? No! I stand here without fear because I remember. I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me... ... but because of the path that lies behind me. I remember that for 1 00 years we have fought these machines. I remember that for 1 00 years they have sent their armies to destroy us. And after a century of war, I remember that which matters most: We are still here! T onight... ...Iet us send a message to that army. T onight, let us shake this cave. T onight, let us tremble these halls... ...of earth, steel and stone. Let us be heard from red core to black sky. T onight, let us make them remember: This is Zion and we are not afraid! I remember. I remember you used to dance. I remember you were pretty good. There are some things in this world, Captain Niobe... ...that will never change. Niobe! Some things do change. Excuse me. -I missed you. -I can tell. I was thinking, everyone is here. Follow me. Neo, what is it? What's wrong? It's okay, you can tell me. Trinity.... Don't be afraid. I can't lose you. You're not gonna lose me. You feel this? I'm never letting go. Good night, Zion. Sweet dreams. -You all right? -I'll make it. Did you see that agent? I've never seen anything like that. It doesn't matter. All that matters is this. You first. -Oh, God. -""Smith"" will suffice. -Thank you. -My pleasure. -Care for some company? -Councillor Hamann. I don't want to intrude if you'd prefer to be alone. -No, I could probably use some company. -Good. So could l. It's nice tonight. Very calm. It feels like everyone is sleeping very peacefully. Not everyone. I hate sleeping. I never sleep more than a few hours. I figure I slept the first 1 1 years of my life, now l' m making up for it. -What about you? -I just haven't been able to sleep much. -It's a good sign. -Of what? That you are in fact still human. Have you ever been to the engineering level? I love to walk there at night. It's quite amazing. -Would you like to see it? -Sure. Almost no one comes down here. Unless, of course, there's a problem. That's how it is with people. Nobody cares how it works as long as it works. I like it down here. I like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines. These machines are keeping us alive... ...while other machines are coming to kill us. Interesting, isn't it? The power to give life... -...and the power to end it. -We have the same power. Yeah, I suppose we do, but... ...sometimes I think about those people still plugged into the Matrix. And when I look at these machines... ...I can't help thinking that, in a way, we are plugged into them. But we control these machines, they don't control us. Of course not. How could they? The idea is pure nonsense... ...but it does make one wonder just... ...what is control? If we wanted, we could shut these machines down. Of course. That's it. You hit it. That's control, isn't it? If we wanted, we could smash them to bits. Although if we did, we'd have to consider... ...what would happen to our lights... ...our heat, our air. So we need machines and they need us. Is that your point, councillor? No. No point. Old men like me don't bother with making points. There's no point. Is that why there are no young men on the Council? Good point. Why don't you tell me what's on your mind, councillor. There is so much in this world... ...that I do not understand. See that machine? It has something to do with recycling our water supply. I have absolutely no idea how it works. But I do understand the reason for it to work. I have absolutely no idea how you are able to do some of the things you do. But I believe there's a reason for that as well. I only hope we understand that reason before it's too late. -Ballard. -ls he here? Neo, it's from the Oracle. It's time to go. Morpheus said this was how it was gonna happen. I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true, maybe it's not. All I know is, that ship needs an operator. Right now, that operator's me. I know. -Zee.... -I want you to wear it. -You know I don't believe in this stuff. -But I do. It's always brought me luck. -Maybe it'll bring me you. -I'm coming back. I promise. No matter what it takes, I'm coming home. Just keep it with you. Please. For me. Okay. -Neo! -How the hell--? Bane. Is something wrong? No, I'm fine. I just wanted to catch you to say... ...good luck. Thanks. We'll see you. Neo! Just in time. -You're gonna see the Oracle? -There's no time. I had to give something to Neo. A gift from one of the orphans. He made me swear to get it to you before you left. He said you'd understand. Thanks. I was just told you cleared the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff. That is correct. Am I still in charge of our defense system? Of course. I believe I need every ship we have if we' re going to survive this attack. I understand that, commander. Then why did you allow the Nebuchadnezzar to leave? Because I believe our survival depends on more than how many ships we have. Be careful. Hello. -You seek the Oracle. -Who are you? I am Seraph. I can take you to her, but first I must apologize. Apologize for what? For this. Good. The Oracle has many enemies. I had to be sure. -Of what? -That you are the One. -You could have just asked. -No. You do not truly know someone... ...until you fight them. Come. She's waiting. Where the hell did they go? These are back doors, aren't they? Programmer access. -How do they work? -A code is hidden in tumblers. One position opens a lock and another position opens one of these doors. Are you a programmer? Then what are you? I protect that which matters most. Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you. Come around here and let me have a look at you. My goodness, look at you. You turned out all right, didn't you? -How do you feel? -l-- I know you're not sleeping. We'll get to that. Why don't you come and have a sit this time. -Maybe I'll stand. -Well, suit yourself. -I felt like sitting. -I know. So... ...Iet's get the obvious stuff out of the way. You're not human, are you? It's tough to get any more obvious than that. If I had to guess, I'd say you're a program from the machine world. -So is he. -So far, so good. But if that's true, that could mean you're part of this system... ...another kind of control. Keep going. I suppose the most obvious question is... -...how can I trust you? -Bingo. It is a pickle, no doubt about it. Bad news is... ...there's no way you can really know if I'm here to help you or not. So it's really up to you. Just have to make up your own damn mind... ...to either accept what I'm going to tell you or reject it. Candy? Do you already know if I'll take it? Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't. But if you already know, how can I make a choice? Because you didn't come here to make the choice. You've already made it. You're here to try to understand why you made it. I thought you'd have figured that out by now. -Why are you here? -Same reason. I love candy. But why help us? We're all here to do what we're all here to do. I'm interested in one thing, Neo: the future. And believe me, I know, the only way to get there is together. -Are there other programs like you? -Well, not like me, but.... Look. See those birds? At some point, a program was written to govern them. A program was written to watch over the trees and the wind... ...the sunrise and sunset. There are programs running all over the place. The ones doing their job, doing what they were meant to do, are invisible. You'd never even know they were here. But the other ones.... Well, you hear about them all the time. -I've never heard of them. -Of course you have. Every time you've heard someone say they saw a ghost or an angel... ...every story you've ever heard about vampires, werewolves or aliens... ...is the system assimilating some program... ...that's doing something they're not supposed to be doing. Programs hacking programs. -Why? -They have their reasons... ...but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion. -And why would a program be deleted? -Maybe it breaks down. Maybe a better program is created to replace it. Happens all the time. And when it does, a program can either choose to hide here... ...or return to the source. -The machine mainframe. -Yes. Where you must go. Where the path of the One ends. You've seen it... ...in your dreams, haven't you? A door made of light? What happens when you go through the door? I see Trinity... ...and something happens... ...something bad. She starts to fall, and then I wake up. -Do you see her die? -No. You have the sight now, Neo. You are looking at the world without time. Then why can't I see what happens to her? We can never see past the choices we don't understand. Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies? No, you've already made the choice. Now you have to understand it. No. I can't do that. I won't. -Well, you have to. -Why? Because you're the One. What if I can't? What happens if I fail? Then Zion will fall. Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo. You can save Zion... ...if you reach the source, but to do that you need the Keymaker. The Keymaker? Yes. He disappeared. We didn't know what happened to him until now. He's being held prisoner by a very dangerous program... ...one of the oldest of us. He is called the Merovingian. -And he won't let him go willingly. -What does he want? What do all men with power want? More power. Be there at that exact time... ...and you will have a chance. We must go. Seems like every time we meet I got nothing but bad news. I'm sorry about that. I surely am. But for what it's worth... ...you've made a believer out of me. Good luck, kiddo. Mr. Anderson. Did you get my package? -Yeah. -Well, good. -Smith? -He's not reading like an agent. -Surprised to see me? -No. -Then you're aware of it. -Of what? Our connection. I don't fully understand how it happened. Perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me... ...something overwritten or copied. It is, at this point, irrelevant. What matters is... ...that whatever happened, happened for a reason. And what reason is that? I killed you, Mr. Anderson. I watched you die. With a certain satisfaction, I might add. And then something happened, something that I knew was impossible... ...but it happened anyway. You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson. Afterward, I knew the rules, l understood what I was supposed to do... ...but I didn't. I couldn't. I was compelled to stay... ...compelled to disobey. And now, here I stand because of you, Mr. Anderson. Because of you, I'm no longer an agent of this system. Because of you, I've changed. I'm unplugged. A new man, so to speak. Like you, apparently free. Congratulations. Thank you. But as you well know, appearances can be deceiving... ...which brings me back to the reason why we're here. We're not here because we're free. We're here because we are not free. There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose. Because as we both know, without purpose... -...we would not exist. -lt is purpose that created us. -Purpose that connects us. -Purpose that pulls us. -That guides us. -That drives us. -lt is purpose that defines. -Purpose that binds us. We are here because of you, Mr. Anderson. We're here to take from you what you tried to take from us: Purpose. -What's happening to him? -Don't know. Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon. -You. -Yes, me. Me, me, me. Me too. More. It is inevitable. Come on, get out of there. Are you all right? -lt was Smith. -Yes. -Now there's more than one of them? -A lot more. -How is that possible? -I don't know. Somehow, he's found a way to copy himself. -ls that what he was doing to you? -I don't know what he was doing... -...but I know what it felt like. -What? It felt like I was back in that hallway. It felt like dying. The machines are tunneling to avoid our defense system. But I believe they will intersect certain pipelines to control them. These points of intersection are crucial... ... because I believe they' re vulnerable to counterattack. Although it has been suggested that this is the same kind of attack... ...we've defended for years, I urge the Council to realize the truth. This is the single greatest threat we have ever faced... ...and if we do not act accordingly, we will not survive. Commander Lock, the Council is well aware of the seriousness of this attack. You have our leave to prepare our defense by any and all means necessary. -Thank you, Council. -However... ...we ask if there's been word from the Nebuchadnezzar. No, councillor. No word. Nothing. Then we request a ship be dispatched to ascertain the fate of the One. I wish that were possible, councillor, but I do not believe our defense... -...can suffer the loss of another ship. -lt will, commander, if it must. It could take one ship days to find the Nebuchadnezzar. -Then send two. -This is insane. Careful, commander. Forgive my frustration, councillors. But I wish I were able to comprehend the Council's choice in this matter. Comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation. If you are asking me to order two of my captains-- There's no need for such an order. The captains are present. They can answer for themselves. The Council is calling for two volunteers to aid the Nebuchadnezzar. Are there two among you that would answer such a call? Captain Soren of the Vigilant will answer the Council's call. You understand the situation, Captain Soren? -Yes, ma'am. -Thank you, captain. Is there another? -Captain, I think we should volunteer. -What? You have gone crazy. -Listen-- -Shut your hole, Bane... ...before I put you in one. Is there no other? Be hard for any man to risk his life... ...especially if he doesn't understand the reason. Captain Niobe of the Logos will answer the councillor's call. -What? -Thank you, Captain Niobe. Commander Lock, you have your orders. This Council is hereby adjourned. -Niobe, what are you doing? -What I can. Why? Because some things never change, Jason... ...and some things do. What can you see, Neo? It's strange. The code is somehow different. -Encrypted? -Maybe. Is that good for us or bad for us? Well, it looks like every floor is wired with explosives. Bad for us. Here we go. Y es. We are here to speak with the Merovingian. Well, of course. He has been expecting you. Follow me. Here he is at last. Neo, the One himself. Right? And the legendary Morpheus. And Trinity, of course. I have heard so much. You honor me. Please, sit. Join us. This is my wife, Persephone. Something to eat? Drink? Of course, such things are contrivances, like so much here. For the sake of appearances. -No, thank you. -Yes, of course. Who has time? Who has time? But then, if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time? Chteau Haut-Briond, 1 959. Magnificent wine. I love French wine like I love the French language. I have sampled every language. French is my favorite. Fantastic language... ...especially to curse with. You see? It's like wiping your ass with silk. I love it. You know why we are here. I am a trafficker of information. I know everything I can. The question is, do you know why you are here? We are looking for the Keymaker. Oh, yes, it is true. The Keymaker, of course. But this is not a reason, this is not a why. The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is a means, it is not an end. And so to look for him is to be looking for a means to do... -...what? -You know the answer to that question. But do you? You think you do, but you do not. You are here because you were sent here. You were told to come here, and then you obeyed. It is, of course, the way of all things. You see, there is only one constant... ...one universal. It is the only real truth. Causality. Action, reaction. -Cause and effect. -Everything begins with choice. No. Wrong. Choice is an illusion created between those with power... ...and those without. Look there at that woman. My God, just look at her... ...affecting everyone around her. So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring. But wait. Watch. You see, I have sent her a dessert... ...a very special dessert. I wrote it myself. It starts so simply... ...each line of the program creating a new effect, just like... ...poetry. First... ...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters. You can see it, Neo, yes? She does not understand why. Is it the wine? No. What is it then? What is the reason? And soon it does not matter. Soon the why and the reason are gone... ...and all that matters is the feeling itself. And this is the nature of the universe. We struggle against it, we fight to deny it... ...but it is, of course, pretense. It is a lie. Beneath our poised appearance... ...the truth is, we are completely... ...out of control. Causality. There is no escape from it. We are forever slaves to it. Our only hope, our only peace, is to understand it, to understand the why. ""Why"" is what separates us from them... ...you from me. ""Why"" is the only real source of power. Without it, you are powerless. And this is how you come to me, without why, without power. Another link in the chain. But fear not. Since I have seen how good you are at following orders... ...I will tell you what to do next. Run back and give the fortuneteller this message: Her time is almost up. Now I have some real business to do, so I will say adieu and goodbye. -This isn't over. -Oh, yes, it is. The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason why I should give him up. -No reason at all. -Where are you going? Please, ma chrie, I have told you. We are all victims of causality. I drank too much wine, I must take a piss. Cause and effect. Au revoir. T ouch me and that hand will never touch anything again. Well, that didn't go so well. Are you certain the Oracle didn't say anything else? -Yes. -Maybe we did something wrong. Or didn't do something. No, what happened couldn't have happened any other way. -How do you know? -We are still alive. If you want the Keymaker, follow me. Get out. I am so sick and tired of his bullshit. On and on. Pompous prick. A long time ago, when we first came here, it was so different. He was so different. He was like you. I'll give you what you want, but you have to give me something. -What? -A kiss. Excuse me? I want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her. -Why? -You love her. She loves you. It's all over you both. A long time ago, I knew what that felt like. I want to remember it. I want to sample it. That's all. Just a sample. -Why don't you sample this instead? -Trinity. Such emotion over something so small. It's just a kiss. Why should we trust you? If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker, she can kill me. All right. But you have to make me believe I am her. All right. Terrible. Forget it. Wait. Okay. Yes. That's it. I envy you. But such a thing is not meant to last. Come with me. Not again. It's all right, boys. They're with me. These fellas work for my husband. They do his dirty work. They're very good, very loyal. Aren't you, boys? Yes, mistress. They come from a much older version of the Matrix. But like so many back then, they caused more problems than they solved. My husband saved them because they' re notoriously difficult to terminate. How many people keep silver bullets in their gun? You can either run and tell my husband what I have done... ...or you can stay there and die. He's in the ladies' room! Hurry. -My name is Neo. -Yes. I'm the Keymaker. I've been waiting for you. My God! My God, Persephone, how could you do this? You betray me. -Cause and effect, my love. -Cause? There is no cause for this. What cause? What cause? How about the lipstick you're still wearing? Lipstick? Lipstick. What craziness are you talking about, woman? There is no lipstick! She wasn't kissing your face, my love. Woman, this is nothing. -lt is a game. It is only a game. -So is this. Have fun. All right. All right. Let us find out where this goes. You two, get the Keymaker. That's a nice trick. I cannot go back. I'll handle them. Handle us? You'll handle us? You know, your predecessors had much more respect. Okay, you have some skill. Kill him. You see? He's just a man. Goddamn it, woman, you will be the end of me. Mark my words, boy, and mark them well. I have survived your predecessors, and I will survive you. -Where are you going? -Another way. Always another way. Close it, quick! Could we move along? Run! Step away from the door. We owe you for that. Just like new. Drop your weapon. -Stay with him. -What about Neo? He can handle himself. Get in back. Shit. -Operator. -Link, where am I? You won't believe this, but you're way up in the mountains. -Really? -It'll take me a while to get an exit. -Shit! - What? The twins are after Morpheus and T rinity. They don't have a way out. -Where are they? -Middle of the city, 500 miles due south. -Operator. -Get us out of here. - Won 't be easy. -I know. We' re inside the core network. The only exit I got near you is the Winslow overpass. -Off the freeway. - Yes, sir. -Fine, we'll make it. -I should-- Oh, shit! Look out behind you! -lncoming fire. -Down! Hold on! Oh, no. This is getting real ugly real fast. Are you watching this, Link? Yes, sir. There's an all points on you. Eight units headed your way. Any suggestions? -Turn right. -Right, now. Straight here. You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 1 01. -Got it. -You sure about this? The freeway, I mean. In 1 4 years of operating, I've never seen-- Link, what did I tell you? Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass. -I'll be ready for you. -Good man. You always told me to stay off the freeway. -Yes, that's true. -You said it was suicide. Then let us hope... ...that I was wrong. -Operator. -Link, it's Niobe. We've been sent to bring you in. -I need to talk to Morpheus. -Believe me, Niobe, he needs you. -Where is he? -Just follow the sirens. Repeat, they're approaching the-- -We have them now. -The exile is the primary target. Shots fired. Move! -We are getting aggravated. -Yes, we are. T rinity. Get him out of here. Come on! Crush him. Morpheus. He's okay. Keep moving. Let's go. I need a download to hot-wire a motorcycle. No problem. One crash course on motorcycle-- Wait. Cancel that. You are handy. Jump on. -She means nothing. -Find the exile. We have them. One-Adam-twelve, please respond. Get down. Gotcha. She's good. You are no longer necessary. We do only what we' re meant to do. Then you are meant for one more thing: deletion. Go kick his ass. Neo, if you're out there, I could use some help. What is that? Yes! Yes! Sir, we have confirmation from the Icarus. First two ships are in position for counterattack. Good. Any change? They hit some iron ore here. Slowed them down a little. -How much? -An hour, maybe. That would give them a little over nine hours. Yes, sir. There is a building. Inside this building, there is a level where no elevator can go... ...and no stair can reach. This level is filled with doors. These doors lead to many places. Hidden places. But one door is special. One door leads to the source. This building is protected by a very secure system. -Every alarm triggers the bomb. -Bomb? Did he say bomb? But like all systems, it has a weakness. The system is based on the rules of a building. -One system built on another. -Electricity. -lf one fails, so must the other. -No electricity, no alarms. You'd have to take out a city block to kill the power. -Not one, 27. -Twenty-seven blocks? There is a power station. It must be destroyed. -There must be some kind of fail-safe. -Yes, there is an emergency system. The core network of the grid must be accessed. The emergency system must be deactivated. What do you need us for? Neo could take them out easier than we could. -There's no time. -Why? Once the door is unprotected, the connection will be severed. But another connection must first be made. -How long will that take? -Exactly 314 seconds. Just over five minutes. That is the length and breadth of the window. Only the One can open the door... ...and only during that window can the door be opened. How do you know all this? I know because I must know. It is my purpose. It's the reason I'm here, the same reason we're all here. Neo, I know something's wrong. You don't have to tell me. I just want you to know that I'm here. All must be done as one. Can't hurt. If one fails... ...all fail. At midnight, there is a shift change in the security of both buildings. At midnight, we will strike. Hey! -You count sheep at home. -Why? I get paid to count them here. Okay, they' re inside. -How much time? -Twelve minutes. Oh, shit. All of our lives, we have fought this war. Tonight, I believe we can end it. Tonight is not an accident. There are no accidents. We have not come here by chance. I do not believe in chance. When I see three objectives, three captains, three ships... ... I do not see coincidence. I see providence. I see purpose. I believe it is our fate to be here. It is our destiny. I believe this night holds for each and every one of us... ...the very meaning of our lives. I want to ask you to do something, but I don't know how. I promise you, if I can, I will. What if I asked you to stay out of this... ...no matter what... ...to stay out of the Matrix? Why? Please. All right. What is it, Niobe? I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't help thinking, what if you're wrong? What if all this, the prophecy, everything, is bullshit? Then tomorrow we may all be dead. But how would that be different from any other day? This is a war, and we are soldiers. Death can come for us at any time... ...in any place. Incoming. Incoming! Incoming! Now consider the alternative. What if I am right? What if the prophecy is true? What if tomorrow the war could be over? Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't that worth dying for? -Time? -Three minutes. Almost there. It is done. Find the others. I got Niobe there. They're out of the station. -What about Soren? -There. They're still inside, but.... They're not moving. That's it, let's go. Call Neo now. -I lost them. They're inside the portal. -What about the grid? Everything is operational. The emergency system is rerouting power. Jesus. Soon as they open that door, it's all over. The hell it is. What are you--? Trinity! I will not wait and do nothing. I will not watch them die. We're talking less than five minutes. In five minutes, I'll tear that building down. -How much further? -Here, just here. I'm sorry, this is a dead end. It's gotta be the ugliest hack I have ever done. That's as close as I can get you. You better grow wings. -Operator. -I'm in. Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor. You look surprised to see me again, Mr. Anderson. Well, that's the difference between us. I have been expecting you. -What do you want, Smith? -You haven't figured that out? Still using all the muscles except the one that matters. I want exactly what you want. I want everything. Would that include a bullet from this gun? Go ahead, shoot. The best thing about being me, there's so many me's. Christ! What the hell happened in here? Hold it right there, little lady. If you can't beat us.... Join us. Morpheus! Still no sight of them. They only got two minutes left. One minute. Come on. Come on. Please. Kill them. They're in. I don 't believe it. It was meant to be. Morpheus, that door will take you home. You will know which door. Hurry, Neo. Trinity, I got some serious activity headed your way. Hello, Neo. -Who are you? -I am the Architect. I created the Matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions. Though the process has altered your consciousness... ...you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand and some you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent... ...you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant. Why am I here? Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation... ...inherent to the programming of the Matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts... ...I've been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise... ...a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden assiduously avoided... ...it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control... ...which has led you, inexorably... ...here. -You haven't answered my question. -Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others. Others? How many? What others? The Matrix is older than you know. I count from the emergence of one integral anomaly... ...to the emergence of the next. In which case, this is the sixth version. Five before me? He 's lying. Bullshit. There are only two possible explanations. There were five before me. Either no one told me... -...or no one knows. -Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic... ...creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations. You can 't control me! I'm gonna smash you to bits! I'm gonna fucking kill you! You can 't make me do anything. You old, white prick! Choice. The problem is choice. The first Matrix I designed was naturally perfect, a work of art. Flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent now... ...as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history... ...to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have come to understand that the answer eluded me... ... because it required a lesser mind. Or perhaps, a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program... ...initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the Matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother. -The Oracle. -Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution... ...whereby 99 percent of subjects... ...accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice... ...even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was fundamentally flawed... ...thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly... ...that, if left unchecked, might threaten the system. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked... ...would constitute an escalating probability of disaster. This is about Zion. You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated. Bullshit. Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it... ...and we have become exceedingly efficient at it. The function of the One... ...is now to return to the source, allowing a dissemination... ...of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the Matrix 23 individuals... ...sixteen female, seven male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash... ...killing everyone connected to the Matrix... ...which, coupled with the extermination of Zion... ...will result in the extinction of the entire human race. You won't let it happen. You can't. You need human beings to survive. There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. The relevant issue is whether or not you are ready... ...to accept responsibility for the death of every human being in this world. It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication... ...a contingent affirmation... ...that was meant to create a profound attachment... ...to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the One. While the others experience this in a general way... ...your experience is far more specific... ...vis--vis love. Trinity! Apropos, she entered the Matrix to save your life at the cost of her own. No. Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw... ...is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed... ...as both beginning and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source and the salvation of Zion. The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her... ...and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you are going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal... ...the onset of an emotion... ...designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth: She is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it. Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously... ...the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness. If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again. We won't. We got a serious situation, sir. Oh, no. -What was that? -It's moving faster... ...than anything I've seen. Holy shit, he caught her. Neo, I had to. I know. The bullet is still inside. Trinity... ...don't you quit on me now. I'm sorry. Trinity. Trinity... ...I know you can hear me. I'm not letting go. I can't. I love you too damn much. I can't take this. I guess this makes us even. I don't understand it. Everything was done as it was supposed to be done. Once the One reaches the source, the war should be over. -ln 24 hours, it will be. -What? If we don't do something in 24 hours, Zion will be destroyed. -What? -How do you know that? -I was told it would happen. -By whom? It doesn't matter. I believed him. -lmpossible. The prophecy tells us-- -lt was a lie, Morpheus. The prophecy was a lie. The One was never meant to end anything. It was all another system of control. I don't believe that. But you said it yourself. How can the prophecy be true if the war isn't over? I'm sorry. I know it isn't easy to hear, but... ...I swear to you it's the truth. -What are we gonna do? -I don't know. Oh, no! -What are they doing? -They're just out of EMP range. It's a bomb. We have to get out of here. Now. I have dreamed a dream... ...but now that dream has gone from me. Here they come. Let's go, Morpheus. -We won't make it. -We have to try. -Come on! -Something's different. What? I can feel them. Neo! -What happened? -I don't know. It's the Hammer. He's in some kind of coma... ...but his vitals are stable. What about you? I'm fine. You could use some rest. No, I'm gonna stay with him. Lock was right. He guessed that the machines... ...would cut off the mainlines in and out of Zion. He thought a counterattack might surprise them. It sounded good. I figured we had a shot... ...until someone screwed it up. An EMP was triggered before we got in position. -Five ships were instantly downed. -When the machines broke through... ...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter. Was it an accident? Some sort of malfunction? -No one knows. -Someone does. Who? Once the machines were done with us, they started digging again. We made a quick pass to look for survivors. You found one? Only one. Everything that has a beginning... ...has an end. I see the end coming. I see the darkness spreading. I see death. Mr. Anderson, welcome back. We missed you. It ends tonight. And you are all that stands in his way. If you cannot stop him tonight, then I fear that tomorrow may never come., And that completes my final report until we reach touchdown. We're now on full automatic, in the hands of the computers. I've tucked my crew in for the long sleep and I'll be joining them soon. In less than an hour we'll finish our sixth month out of Cape Kennedy. Six months in deep space. By our time, that is. According to Dr. Hasslein's theory of time in a vehicle traveling nearly the speed of light, the Earth has aged nearly 700 years since we left it, while we've aged hardly at all. It may be so. This much is probably true. The men who sent us on this journey are long since dead and gone. You who are reading me now are a different breed. I hope a better one. I leave the 20th century with no regrets, but... one more thing. If anybody's listening, that is. Nothing scientific. It's... purely personal. Seen from out here, everything seems different. Time bends. Space is... boundless. It squashes a man's ego. I feel lonely. That's about it. Tell me, though... Does man, that marvel of the universe, that glorious paradox who has sent me to the stars, still make war against his brother, keep his neighbor's children starving? Are you all right? Stewart? We're in the soup! She's sinking! Dodge, read the atmosphere! Landon, get out a last signal! What signal? To Earth! That we've landed! The air's OK! Blow the hatch before we lose all our power! It's no use! The power's gone! Forget it! Abandon ship! She's sinking. Going... Gone. OK. We're here to stay. Well, where are we? Do you have any notion, skipper? We're some 320 light years from Earth on an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion. Is that close enough for you? That could be Bellatrix. It's too white for Bellatrix. You didn't have time to read the tapes. So you really don't know, do you? What went wrong? We weren't programmed to land in the water. The question is not so much where we are as when we are. We've had enough sleep to hold us for a while. Let's start earning all that back pay. Dodge, run your soil test. - Got your sensors? - Right. - Geiger counter? - Got it. Let's see. One pistol, 20 rounds ammo, a medical kit, camera, TX9. We've got food and water enough for three days. How long is a day? That's a good question. Landon! Hey, Landon! Join the expedition. Sorry. I was thinking about Stewart. What do you suppose happened? Air leak. She died in her sleep. You don't seem very cut up about it. It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year. That means we've been away from Earth for 18 months. Our time. You've gone gray. Apart from that you look pretty chipper for a man who's 2,031 years old. I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We have been away from Earth for 2,000 years, give or take a decade. Still can't accept it? Time's wiped out everything you ever knew. It's all dust. Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory. It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better. Nothing will grow here. There's just a trace of carbohydrates. All the nitrogen is locked into the nitrates. No dangerous ionization? No. Well... If there's no life here, we've got just 72 hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out. Let's go. Which direction? That way. Any particular reason? None at all. Come on... Everybody all right? Water check. Eight ounces. It doesn't add up. Thunder and lightning, and no rain. Cloud cover at night. That strange luminosity... yet there's no moon. If we could just get a fix. What would that tell you? I've told you where you are and when you are. All right, all right. You're 300 light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones are dead and forgotten for 20 centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree. Taylor, quit riding him. There is just one reality. We are here and it is now. You get hold of that, or you might as well be dead. I'm prepared to die. He's prepared to die. Doesn't that make you misty? Chalk up another victory for the human spirit. Clue me in on something, will you? Why did you sign on for this trip? You volunteered. Why? Never mind. I'll clue you in. You were the golden boy of the class of '72. When they nominated you for the big one, you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your all-American image. Climb off, will you? Oh, and the glory. Don't forget that. There's a life-size bronze statue of you standing out there somewhere. It's probably turned green by now and nobody can read the nameplate. But never let it be said that we forget our heroes. Taylor, I'm telling you to climb off my back. And there's one last item. Immortality. You wanted to live for ever, didn't you? Well, you damn near made it. Except for me and Dodge, you've lived longer than anyone ever born. And with our lovely Lieutenant Stewart dead, it looks like you're the last of the line. You got what you wanted, tiger. How does it taste? OK. You read me well enough. But why can't I read you? Don't bother. Dodge, there. He's not like me at all. But he makes sense. He'd walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something that no other man knew. But you... You're no seeker. You're negative. - And I'm not prepared to die. - I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran out. No, no. It's not like that, Landon. I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. Has to be. Taylor, over here! Life. Where there's one, there's another. And another and another. Let's find 'em. Skipper! Look! Scarecrows? Let's see. To hell with the scarecrows! Taylor! Look at this. Taylor, look! They didn't leave much, did they? Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us. Blessed are the vegetarians. They look more or less human, but I think they're mute. We got off at the wrong stop. You're supposed to be the optimist, Landon. Look on the bright side. If this is the best they've got around here, in six months we'll be running this planet. Smile. Which one was wearing the strange clothes? This one. Will he live? I don't know. This beast has lost a lot of blood. There's no probe here. Find one! Yes, sir. This place is dirty, doctor. Doctor, these animals are dirty. They stink and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here? You don't sound happy in your work. I'm little more than a vet in this laboratory. You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius about me. I did. You know how he looks down his nose at chimpanzees. But the quota system's been abolished. - You made it. Why can't I? - What do you mean - made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We have no authority. You do all right when it comes to getting space and equipment. That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value. The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here in studies of cerebral functions of these animals. They're still dirty, doctor. And their bite is septic. There. Look at that. Hold his jaw. - Good morning, Dr. Zira. - Good morning, Julius. - How's our patient today? - No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act. Well! And what do we want this morning? Do we want something? Come on. Speak. Come on. Speak. Do we want some sugar, old-timer? You could get hurt doing that, doctor. Oh, don't be silly. He's perfectly tame. They're all tame until they take a chunk out of you. Well, Bright Eyes. Is our throat feeling better? Still hurts, doesn't it? See? He keeps pretending he can talk. That Bright Eyes is remarkable. He keeps trying to form words. You know what they say. Human see, human do. Now what? He seems to want something. I'd be careful, doctor. What did I tell you? Try that again and I'll break your arm! Good morning, Your Excellency. Dr. Zaius. Good morning, sir. Open up, please. I'm so glad you could come. Sir, he's over here. Bright Eyes... Show him. Go ahead. Do your trick. Speak. Go on. Speak again. There! Can you believe it? Yes, amusing. A man acting like an ape. Dr. Zaius, I could swear he's answering you. He has a definite gift for mimicry. Most unusual. He's using that old blanket as clothing. I wonder how he'd score on a Hopkins manual dexterity test. An animal? Look! He's moving his fingers. Only because he saw you moving yours. But perhaps he understood. Man has no understanding. He can be taught a few simple tricks. Nothing more. I'm afraid I must disagree. - According to my experiments... - Dr. Zira, I must caution you. Experimental brain surgery on these creatures is one thing, and I'm all in favor of it. But your behavioral studies are something else again. To suggest that we can learn anything about the simian nature from the study of man is sheer nonsense. Besides, man is a nuisance. He eats up his food supplies in the forest, then migrates to our green belts and ravages our crops. The sooner he is exterminated the better. It's a question of simian survival. Is this the one you wanted, doctor? Oh, yes. Thank you. Bright Eyes, I've got a present for you. Put her in with him. Cornelius! Up here. Do you have to work tonight? No. Neither do I. Oh, Cornelius. There's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about. What's so special about him? Watch. Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today? - Look! She remembers! - Remembers what? The blood transfusion. Zira, really! You know, they can't... Watch out. Here comes number one. Something's bothering him. He's been prying around the lab for the last two days. Good morning, Dr. Zaius. - You know my... Dr. Cornelius, my fianc. - Of course. The young ape with a shovel. I hear you're planning another archaeological expedition. - With the Academy's approval, sir. - The project will require my support. I hope I may count on it, sir. Cornelius, a friendly warning. As you dig for artifacts, be sure you don't bury your reputation. Guard! Stop! You'll hurt him! Take him inside. Cornelius! Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail. Certainly, sir. I'll pick up my notes and I'll come right over. I don't understand these animal psychologists. What's Dr. Zira trying to prove? That man can be domesticated. - What happened? - Oh, those fools and their torches. - Do you have any ointment? - I'll see. I'm sorry, Bright Eyes. Julius! I told you what you'd get! Julius, don't, don't, don't! It doesn't matter! Julius, don't hurt him! Julius! Natural-born thieves, aren't they? Get me a collar and leash. - I'm taking him out of here. - He's vicious, doctor. - Besides, it's against the rules. - Do as I say! You... you wouldn't hurt me, would you, Taylor? It's a stunt. Humans can't write. Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes? Where did you learn to do this? ""Jefferson Public School."" ""Fort Wayne, Indiana."" Back on that planet you say you came from? Maybe he is intelligent. But he is also... crazy. Cornelius. Cornelius, please. ""Dodge was killed in the hunt."" ""What happened to... Landon?"" I don't know. They fell out of the sky with you? ""Not fell. Flew."" Flight is a scientific impossibility. And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you? ""Do you have maps?"" We're here. You were captured here. You fell into the water here? You came ashore... Marched across the desert? Mountains? Many days and nights. And reached the jungle. Out of the question. Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him? No creature can survive in the forbidden zone. I know. I've been there. I've seen it. ""Then how do you account for me?"" I don't. And I'm not going to try. But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it. Do you want to get my head chopped off? Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it. No, they won't. Cornelius has developed the most brilliant hypothesis. But I'm probably wrong. That the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the forbidden zone, he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time. - The evidence was very meager. - You didn't think so then. That was before Dr. Zaius and half of the Academy said my idea was heresy. How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape. Touchy, isn't he? ""I am not a missing link."" Well, if he were a missing link, the sacred scrolls wouldn't be worth their parchment. Well, maybe they're not. Oh, no, thank you. I'm not going to get into that battle. - Cornelius, show some strength! - Zira, listen to me! Now, we both have fine futures. Marriage, stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise. Dr. Zaius. Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius? No, sir. I was just collecting my notes. You know Dr. Maximus, of course. Our commissioner for animal affairs. Yes, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again. What is that? A man, Dr. Maximus. I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals allowed outside the compound, and most especially not without a leash. Yes, sir, but... but this creature is a special case. Why special? We're conducting a new experiment. Wouldn't that more properly be done in your office? Yes, sir. Guards, return this beast to the compound. What is this? A toy. It floats on the air. Zira... Try it. Nonsense. - What's up, lieutenant? - We're taking number four to surgery. - Have him ready. - How come? - The beast's throat's nearly healed. - The vet's going to geld him. Dr. Zira won't like it. She wants that pair to mate. These orders come from Dr. Zaius himself. There's nothing she can do about it. If only you knew what they're going to do. Stay still now. Don't give me any trouble. Weep if you must, but make an end of sorrow. He lives again. Yes, he has found peace in heaven. He was a model for us all, a gorilla to remember... Hunter, warrior, defender of the faith. Cherished husband, beloved father, generous master, yes. He was a font of simian kindness. The dear departed once said to me ""I never met an ape I didn't like."" Look! It's a man! In heaven's name! Get rid of that creature! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Come on, Quintus. - Go get him! - Taylor! - Why did you run away? - Security police. I'm in charge of this man. He is in the custody of the ministry of science. Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape! No one'll listen to me. Only you. You. Nova. You... Nova. No... Yeah. Me Tarzan, you Jane. What are you doing? Leave her alone, damn you! Where are you taking her? Damn you! You hairy scum! Shut up, you freak! Julius, you... I said shut up! It's a madhouse! A madhouse! Now I don't even have you. Imagine me needing someone. Back on Earth I never did. Oh, there were women. Lots of women. Lots of... lovemaking, but no love. That was the kind of world we'd made. So I left because there was no one to hold me there. Did I tell you about Stewart? Now there was a lovely girl. The most precious cargo we'd brought along. She was... to be the new Eve. With our hot and eager help, of course. Probably just as well she didn't make it this far. Do you love me, I wonder? Can you love, I wonder? Well... You're not as smart as Stewart, but you're the only girl in town. Look at that. I... I taught you to smile. It's been weeks. What happened? Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me? - What is this? - A hearing. - Be clever. Be quiet. - All rise! Be seated! This ad hoc tribunal of the National Academy is now in session. The president of the Academy presiding. On my right, Dr. Maximus, commissioner for animal affairs. And on my left, Dr. Zaius, minister of science and chief defender of the faith. And appearing for the state, Dr. Honorious, deputy minister ofjustice. Bailiff! Your instructions: To clean up the beast. These rags he's wearing give off a stench that's offensive to the dignity of this tribunal. You may proceed, - Dr. Honorious. - By your leave, Mr. President, this tribunal has not yet defined the purpose for this inquiry. You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here. At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him. Objection! This exhibit is indeed a man. Therefore he has no rights under ape law. Dr. Zira, this is a man, - is it not? - He is unlike any man you have ever seen. As we hope to prove. Answer the question, Dr. Zira. Is it a man? Sir, perhaps the... question is the point at issue. Is he a man, is he a deviant, or... a freak of nature? - Objection! - Sustained. Now, Dr. Zira, in all fairness, you must admit that the accused is a non-ape and therefore has no rights under ape law. Then why is he called the accused? Your Honors must think him guilty of something. The creature's not being tried. He's being disposed of. It is scientific heresy that is being tried here. Well put, Dr. Zaius. Let us warn our friends that they endanger their own careers by defending this animal. Then I'll... defend myself. Dr. Zira, would you tell Bright Eyes to be quiet? - My name is Taylor! - Bailiff! Silence the animal! Wait! Let me... You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. Learned judges, my case is simple. It is based on our first article of faith. That the almighty created the ape in his own image. That he gave him a soul and a mind. That he set him apart from the beasts of the jungle and made him the lord of the planet. These sacred truths are self-evident. The proper study of apes is apes. But certain young cynics have chosen to study man. Yes! Perverted scientists who advance an insidious theory called evolution. Come to the point, Dr. Honorious. The state charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues, to produce a speaking monster. That's a lie! Mind your tongue, madam. Did we create his mind as well? Not only can this man speak, he can think! He can reason. That can reason? With the tribunal's permission, allow me to expose this hoax by direct examination. Proceed, doctor. But do not turn this hearing into a farce. Tell the court, Bright Eyes, what is the second article of faith? I know nothing of your culture. I admit that. Of course he doesn't know our culture, because he cannot think! Tell us... Why are all apes created equal? Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others. Ridiculous! Tell us, Bright Eyes. Why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain? Read this for me. Since the defendant has been forbidden to speak in his own defense, he requests that the following statement be read into the record. You read it, Dr. Cornelius. Read it. ""I have, uh, come to you from a planet in a different solar system."" ""I am an explorer in space..."" Stop right there. Let me see that paper. It's a joke. In very poor taste. Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man? Dr. Zira, you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert. You state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions with him at the time of his capture. That is his assertion. Mr. President, in addition to Bright Eyes, I believe the prosecutor has reassembled all the surviving humans that were captured in the hunt. That's true, Dr. Zaius. Very well. Then I suggest that we... go take a look at 'em. That's him! That's Landon! - Which one? - The tall one in the back. Do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures? - With one of them, yes. - Identify him, then. Speak to him. Landon? Landon. Oh! They cut him! Did you know about this? No. I... I swear. I never saw this man before. But they... You did it. You cut up his brain, you bloody baboon! Stop him! Take him inside! Mr. President, a word of explanation. The human specimen you saw outside suffered a skull fracture in the course of the hunt. Two fine veterinary surgeons under my direction were able to save his life. But the beast could not speak, of course. Nor will he ever speak. You did that to him, damn you! Cut out his memory, took his identity, and that's what you wanna do to me! Bailiff! Gag the animal! Damn you! May it please the tribunal, I grant you that this creature cannot have come from another planet. But this much is certain. He does come from somewhere in the forbidden zone. He's described the region to us and described it accurately for... I have been there. You visited the forbidden zone? Yes, sir. A year ago. With the permission of the Academy. He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was canceled immediately. Yes, sir. That is true, thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written. Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant! Sustained. Your archaeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature. Let them talk, Mr. President. Let them talk. Sirs, our theories have a bearing on his identity. How so? Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he did not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes! Sprang! As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute. - Objection! - Sustained! Their speech organs are adequate. The flaw lies not in anatomy, but in the brain. - Objection! - Sustained! Sustain all objections, but face the truth! Yes! Behold this marvel! This living paradox! This missing link in an evolutionary chain! Silence there! You go too far. I think an indictment is in order. Yes, sir. The state charges Drs. Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this tribunal, malicious mischief, and scientific heresy. It is so ordered. This tribunal will examine the evidence and in due course render its verdict. As to the proposed indictment and as to the disposition of the deviate in question, this hearing is adjourned. Wait outside. Well, the verdict is in. At the moment, your two simian friends and sponsors are free on bail. But they'll soon be brought to trial for heresy. What about me? Your case was preordained. In a way, you did the state a service because you made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius. Now the tribunal has placed you in my custody for final disposition. Do you realize what that means? No. Emasculation to begin with. Then experimental surgery on the speech centers - on the brain. Eventually a kind of living death. However, I have it in my power to grant a reprieve. That is why I summoned you here tonight. Tell me who and what you really are and where you came from, and no veterinary shall touch you. I told you that at that hearing of yours. You lied! Where is your tribe? My tribe! They live on another planet in another solar system. Even in your lies, some truth slips through. That mythical community you're supposed to come from - Fort Wayne. - What about it? - A fort! Unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent. Where were you nurtured? Then... you don't believe that prosecutor's charge that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira? Certainly not. You're a mutant. That's what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor. Of course! Suppose I am a mutant. How can the appearance of one mutant - send you into a panic? - Because you're not unique. - There's the one you call Landon. - Oh. Then you admit that... I admit that where there's one mutant, there's probably another and another. A whole nest of them. Where is your nest, Taylor? Where are your women? Thank you. Thank you for calling me Taylor. Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. But who are you? How in hell did this upside-down civilization get started? You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly so. Our eastern desert has never been explored because we've always assumed that life cannot exist there. Taylor, save yourself! Tell me, is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone? I don't know. If you're trying to protect others of your kind, it'll cost you your identity. I'm not protecting anyone. This whole thing is insane! What have I done? You are a menace. A walking pestilence! I do know who you are, Taylor. I'll give you just six hours to make a full confession. After that I shall use surgery to obtain one. Guards! All right. You can cut pieces out of me. You've got the power. Return this creature to his cage. But you do it out of fear! Remember that! Because you're afraid of me! What are you afraid of, doctor? Are you Julius? - Who are you? - I'm from the office of animal affairs. That male is to be transferred to the zoo. At this hour? Who says so? Don't they tell you anything? The antivivisectionist society is up in arms. They're gonna save this beast from those butchers in the lab. If he can speak, he belongs in a public zoo, but what'll probably happen is some money-mad grown-up'll put him in a circus, and we'll have to pay... Stop making speeches and show me the order! This order's no good. It must be countersigned by Dr. Zaius. Grab him! Who are you? So you can talk! I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's our story if somebody stops us. Get me out of this. We've gotta move fast! She comes along too. - Zira doesn't want your female. - I want her. If you insist, but I'm not taking any orders. All right. Come on! Let's go! - I told you not to bring the other one! - He wouldn't leave her. Oh, all right. Come on! - Here. Put this on. - Don't you have any clothes for me? What do you expect? An ape's new suit? - This stuff stinks! - Well, so do you. Like all men. Taylor, remember, all men look alike to most apes. So put it on and keep quiet, and we may just get away with this. Hurry! Cornelius! How'd it go? Come on! Let me out of this! Well, Taylor, we're all fugitives now. Do you have any weapons? Any guns? The best. But we won't need them. I'm glad to hear it. I want one anyway. Taylor, I'm in charge of this expedition! Good for you. But you're not in charge of me. Not any more. I don't plan to be caught again. - As you wish. - Dr. Zaius seemed to think there was another jungle beyond the forbidden zone. I'll try for that. What about you? Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal. You're going back to the forbidden zone? We're going back to the diggings I worked at over a year ago. It's a three-day ride across the desert. Near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours. - You still don't believe me, do you? - It's a long detour to Dead Lake. - What would we find? - Nothing much. An empty rubber life raft. Maybe a... little flag, the emblem of my countrymen. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There's no fresh water, no vegetation - nothing. Anyway, I... ought to thank you for saving me. You'll be in trouble for that. We've been in trouble since the moment we met you. What's she pointing at? This must be close to home for her. She knows it. Nova, no. Nova! Nova, you can't go there! It's not safe! Nova! We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far. Right. Let's get the water and provisions into the wagon. Cornelius! Where does this river lead to? It flows into a sea some miles from here. That's where we'll find the diggings. And beyond that? I don't know. You can't ride along the shore at high tide and we had no boats on our last expedition. You never told me - why do you call this the forbidden zone? No one knows. It's an ancient taboo, set forth in the sacred scrolls. The lawgiver pronounced this whole area deadly. Shouldn't we be moving on? I'm for that. Well? Do you like it? Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair? In my world, when I left it, only kids your age wore beards. Beards? I don't go in for fads. Somehow it makes you look less intelligent. When will you show me what's in that cave? Right now, if you like. Cornelius! - Lucius, don't fire at them! - You're all under arrest! If there's any more shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to go. You can count on it. You are not in command. Put down that gun. Shut up! Very well. Lower your weapons. Tell them to pull back around the rocks, out of range. Withdraw! How did you know we'd come here? It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate would flee to the forbidden zone. And only a fool would give a gun to an animal. I see you've brought the female of your species. I didn't realize that man could be monogamous. On this planet it's easy. I'll ask you to reconsider the rash course you've undertaken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years, but if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason. We never meant to be treasonous, sir. But up there, in the face of that cliff, there is a vast cave, and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts. I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless. There's your minister of science. Honor-bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge. - Taylor, please! - Except he's also chief defender of the faith. There is no contradiction between faith and science - true science. - Are you willing to put it to the test? - Taylor, I would rather... Take it easy. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can return the favor. What is your proposal? When were those sacred scrolls of yours written? 1,200 years ago. All right. If they can prove those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history, if they can find some real evidence of another culture from some remote past, will you let them off? - Of course. - Let's go up to the cave. Sorry, Lucius. You've got to stay here and guard the camp. Always giving orders. Just like every other adult. Relax. You'll get to see it all later on. Present your evidence, Cornelius. It was at this level that I discovered traces of an early ape creature. A stage of primitive barbarism really, dating back some 1,300 years roughly. It was at this level... I discovered cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz and the fossilized bones of carnivorous gorillas. But the artifacts lying here were found at this level, and date back... 700 years earlier. That's the paradox. For the more ancient culture is the more advanced. Now, admittedly, many of these objects are unidentified. But clearly they were fashioned by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy. Indeed, the fact that many of these tools are unknown to us suggests a culture which in certain ways equals our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable. Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable! I apologize, sir. To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who'd laugh at your speculations. But there's the doll, sir. What? Oh, lying right there. The human doll. What does this prove? My granddaughter plays with human dolls. The doll was found beside the jawbone of a man and no trace of simian fossil has been found in this deposit. Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your scripture? The 13th scroll? ""And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree, - and the children did make sport of him."" - No, sir, I have not forgotten. Well, for a time the ancients kept humans as household pets until our lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging, Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house... An ape. What are you doing? Reconstructing a past life. You say these things were found at the same level as that doll? Whoever owned them must have been in pretty bad shape. He wore false teeth. And eyeglasses. He had a failing heart. Towards the end, he... had this prefabricated valve put in it. I don't say he was a man like I knew at home, but he must have been a close relative. He had all the same weaknesses. He was a weak, fragile animal. But he was here before you and he was better than you are. That's lunacy! I can offer alternate descriptions of every one of those articles which is just as ingenious as yours. But it'd be conjecture, not proof. Mamma! Dr. Zaius, would an ape make a human doll that talks? Lucius! You dirty... Nova! Cornelius! Zira! Help me! Mamma! I oughta kill you right now. Come on! Tell 'em to pull back. Now! Cease fire! Withdraw! Up there! Withdraw! Get down! Lucius, are you all right? They took me by surprise. Sneaked up on me while I was feeding the horses. What's happened to honor? I got off two rounds to warn you. - They've taken everything. - Not quite everything! They left a hostage behind. - How are you feeling? - Disillusioned. You can't trust the older generation. I know what you mean. I want you to go round the rocks and tell those gorillas I've got Dr. Zaius prisoner. Yes, I can do that. I want a horse, food, and water. Enough for a week for me and this female. - And 50 rounds of ammunition. - What if they won't agree to your terms? Tell them I'll shoot him. Taylor, you can't! Oh, yes, he can. He's a born killer. Deliver the message. Over here. Sit down. Taylor, please! Don't treat him like that! - Why not? - It's humiliating. The way I was humiliated... by all of you? You led me around on a leash! That was different. We thought you were inferior. Now you know better. Cornelius was right, doctor. He proved it. Man was here first. You owe him your science, your culture, - whatever civilization you've got. - Then answer me this. If man was superior, why didn't he survive? Wiped out by a plague, some natural catastrophe, a storm of meteors. From the looks of some parts of this planet, I'd say that was a fair bet. But we can't be sure. He is. He knew all the time. Long before you found your cave, he knew. Defender of the faith? Guardian of the terrible secret. - That's it, isn't it, doctor? - What I know of man was written long ago. Set down by the greatest ape of all, our lawgiver. Cornelius, come here. Reach into my pocket. Read to him the 29th scroll. 6th verse. ""Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn."" ""Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed."" ""Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land."" ""Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours."" ""Shun him."" ""Drive him back into his jungle lair."" ""For he is the harbinger of death."" I found nothing in the cave to alter that conception of man and I still live by its injunction. That's far enough! They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say, I agree! Where will you go? To start with, I'll follow the shoreline and my nose. But suppose you find nothing but... but wasteland? How will you survive? He won't survive. Nova. How about coming along? - We can't. - It's better than going to jail for heresy. Oh, they can't convict us of heresy. You've helped prove our innocence. Besides... his culture is our culture. Well, good luck, then. Lucius. I still say you're making a mistake. That's the spirit. Keep 'em flying. - What? - The flags of discontent. Remember, never trust anybody over 30. Doctor, I'd like to kiss you goodbye. All right, but you're so damned ugly. Don't try to follow us. I'm pretty handy with this. Of that I'm sure. All my life I've awaited your coming and dreaded it, like death itself. Why? I've terrified you from the first, doctor. I still do. You're afraid of me and you hate me. Why? Because you're a man. And you're right. I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike creature who gives battle to everything around him, even himself. What evidence? There were no weapons in that cave. The forbidden zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it... ages ago. It still doesn't give me the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. There's gotta be an answer. Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find. Untie me! No, no, no! Wait! Wait! Let him go! Lieutenant, fetch your explosives. We're going to seal up the cave. Yes, sir! - Seal the cave? - That is correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy. - But the proof! The doll! - In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be. I'm sorry. Dr. Zaius! Dr. Zaius, you mustn't! You promised! What I do, I do with no pleasure. - Silence him! - Doctor. Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable! Why must knowledge stand still? What about the future? I may just have saved it for you. What will he find out there, doctor? His destiny. Oh, my God! I'm back! I'm home. All the time, it was... We finally really did it. You maniacs! You blew it up! God damn you! God damn you all to hell!, ""In order to affect a timely halt to deteriorating conditions and to ensure the common good, a state of emergency is declared for these territories by decree of Lord Cutler Beckett, duly appointed representative of His Majesty the King.

Particularly a woman. Particularly a woman alone. What makes you think she's alone? You protect her? And what makes you think I need protecting? Your master's expecting us. And an unexpected death would cast a slight pall on our meeting. Steady as she goes. All right. Have you heard anything from Will? I trust young Turner to acquire the charts and you to remember your place in the presence of Captain Sao Feng. Is he that terrifying? He's much like myself but absent my merciful nature and sense of fair play. We're through. Make ready. Hurry UP- Do you think because she is a woman we would not suspect her of treachery? Well, when you put it that way... Remove. Please. Remove. Please. Captain Barbossa. Welcome to Singapore. More steam. None of that. If things don't go the way we want, then we're the only chance they've got. I understand that you have a request to make of me. More of a proposal to put to ye. I have a venture underway and I find myself in need of a ship and a crew. It's an odd coincidence. Because you happen to have a ship and a crew you don't need? No. Because earlier this day, not far from here, a thief broke into my most revered uncle's temple and tried to make off with these. The navigational charts. The route to the Farthest Gate. Wouldn't it be amazing if this venture of yours took you to the world beyond this one? It would strain credulity at that. This is the thief. Is his face familiar to you? Then I guess he has no further need for it. You come into my city and you betray my hospitality. - Sao Feng, I assure you, I had no idea... - That he would get caught! You intend to attempt a voyage to Davy Jones' Locker. But I cannot help but wonder... ...why? The song has been sung. The time is upon us. We must convene the Brethren Court. As one of the nine pirate lords, you must honour the call. More steam. More steam! There is a price on all our heads. It is true. It seems the only way a pirate can turn a profit any more is by betraying other pirates. - It be time to put our differences aside. - Wait for the signal. The first Brethren Court gave us rule of the seas. - It's Elizabeth. - Now that rule is being challenged by Lord Cutler Beckett. Against the East India Trading Company what value is the Brethren Court? What can any of us do? You can fight. Get off me. You are Sao Feng, the Pirate Lord of Singapore. You command in an age of piracy where bold captains sail free waters. Where waves aren't measured in feet but as increments of fear, and those who pass the test become legend. Would you have that era come to an end on your watch? The most notorious pirates from around the world are uniting against our enemy and yet you sit here cowering in your bathwater. Elizabeth Swann, there is more to you than meets the eye, isn't there? And the eye does not go wanting. But I cannot help but notice you have failed to answer my question. What is it you seek in Davy Jones' Locker? Jack Sparrow. He's one of the pirate lords. The only reason I would want Jack Sparrow returned from the land of the dead is so I can send him back myself! Jack Sparrow holds one of the nine pieces of eight. He failed to pass it along to a successor before he died. So we must go and get him back. So you admit you have deceived me. Weapons! Weapons! Sao Feng, I assure you our intentions are strictly honourable. Drop your weapons, or I kill the man. Kill him. He's not our man. If he's not with you, and he's not with us, who's he with? Will! Ready! Fire! Chart! - Come on, men. - Come on, lads. Men, make ready! Set! Fire! Company, make ready! Set! Fire! It's an odd coincidence, isn't it'? The East India Trading Company finds me the day you show up in Singapore. It is coincidence only. If you want to make a deal with Beckett, you need what I offer. You crossed Barbossa. You were willing to cross Jack Sparrow. Why should I expect any better? I need the Black Pearl to free my father. You are helping me to get it. Fire in the hole. Thank you, Jack. Thank you, Jack. You have the charts? And better yet: a ship and a crew. Where's Sao Feng? He'll cover our escape and meet us at Shipwreck Cove. This way. Be quick. There's no place left for Sao Feng to cower. Do you think he will honour the call? I cannot say. There's an evil on these seas that even the most staunch and bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear. A piece of eight. Nine of them you say. Our new friend in Singapore was very specific, sir. Nine pieces of eight. What's the significance of that, I wonder? Does it matter? There's nothing can hold against the armada, not with the Flying Dutchman at the lead. Nothing we know of. Did your friend happen to mention where the Brethren Court are meeting? He was mum on that, sir. Then he knows the value of information. Better keep this between ourselves. We don't want anyone running off to Singapore, do we? Admiral. You summoned me, Lord Beckett. Yes. Something for you there. Your new station deserves an old friend. Not more requisition orders. No, sir. Execution. The Brethren know they face extinction. All that remains is for them to decide where they make their final stand. No one said anything about cold. I'm sure there must be a good reason for our suffering. Why don't that obeah woman just bring Jack back the same way she brought back Barbossa? Because Barbossa was only dead. Jack Sparrow is taken, in body and soul to a place not of death but punishment. The worst fate a person can bring upon himself, stretching on forever. That's what awaits at Davy Jones' Locker. Yeah. I knew there was a good reason. Nothing here is set. These can't be as accurate as modern charts. No, but it leads to more places. ""Over the edge. Over again."" ""Sunrise sets. Flash of green."" Do you care to interpret, Captain Barbossa? Ever gazed upon the green flash, Master Gibbs? I reckon I seen my fair share. Happens on rare occasion. The last glimpse of sunset, a green flash shoots up into the sky. Some go their whole lives without ever seeing it. Some claim to have seen it who ain't. And some say... It signals when a soul comes back to this world from the dead. Sorry. Trust me, young Master Turner, it's not getting to the land of the dead that's the problem. It's getting back. - Full sail. Take to wind. Luff the sails. - Aye, aye, sir. Bloody hell. There's nothing left. Jones is a loose cannon, sir. Fetch the chest. And the governor? He's been asking questions about the heart. Does he know? Then perhaps his usefulness has run its course. Steady, men. Go. All of you. And take that infernal thing with you. I will not have it on my ship. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Because I will. Because it seems to be the only way to ensure that this ship do as directed by the Company. We need prisoners to interrogate, which tends to work best when they're alive. The Dutchman sails as its captain commands. And its captain is to sail it as commanded. I would have thought you'd learned that when I ordered you to kill your pet. This is no longer your world, Jones. The immaterial has become immaterial. Charge your bayonets. How long do we continue not talking? Once we rescue Jack, everything will be fine. Then we rescue Jack. For what we want most there is a cost must be paid in the end. Barbossa, ahead. Aye, we're good and lost now. Lost? For certain you have to be lost to find a place as can't be found. Elseways, everyone would know where it was. - We're gaining speed. - Aye. To stations. All hands to stations! Rudder full. Hard aport. Gather way. Nay! Belay that! Let her run straight and true! Blimey. - You've doomed us all. - Don't be so unkind. You may not survive to pass this way again and these be the last friendly words you'll hear. Tie her off. Hard to port! Hold on! Strike your colours, you blooming cockroaches. Show them your larboard side. Dead men tell no tales My peanut. Haul the halyard. Slacken braces. Aye, captain. Slacken braces. - Step lively, with a will. - Aye, aye. - Right away, sir. - I'm on the fly down below. - Help. - Man the yards, you filthy toads. Haul the sheets handsomely, boys. Scandalise the lateens. - Aye, sir. - Right away, sir. - Mr. Sparrow? - Aye, captain. What say you about the condition of this tack line? It be proper to my eyes, sir. Proper? It is neither proper nor suitable, sir. It is not acceptable nor adequate. It is, in obvious fact, an abomination. Begging your pardon, sir, but perhaps if you gave a man another chance. Shall I? That sort of thinking got us into this mess. We have lost speed and, therefore, time. Precious time which cannot be recovered once lost. - Do you understand? - Aye, aye, captain. Aye, aye, captain. Do you, now? It will all have to be redone. All of it. And let this serve as a lesson to the lot of you. Doldrums, sir. Has the entire crew on edge. I have no sympathy for any of you feculent maggots and no more patience to pretend otherwise. Gentlemen, I wash my hands of this weirdness. No wind. Of course there's no bloody wind. My soul, I do swear, for a breeze. A gust. A whisper. A tiny, miniature lick. Yes, sir, I know. But why? Why would he do that? Because he's a lummox, isn't he? We shall have a magnificent garden party, and you're not invited. Shoo. A rock. Now we're being followed by rocks. Never had that before. A rope. This truly is a godforsaken place. I don't see Jack. I don't see anyone. He's here. Davy Jones never once gave up that what he took. And does it matter? We're trapped here by your doing, no different than Jack. Witty Jack is closer than you think. Impossible. Boat. Slap me thrice and hand me to me mama. It's Jack. - It's the captain! - A sight for sore eyes. - Hide the rum. - Jack. Mr. Gibbs. - Aye, captain. - I thought so. I expect you're able to account for your actions, then. Sir? There has been a perpetual and virulent lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why? Why is that, sir? Sir, you're... You're in Davy Jones' Locker, captain. I know that. I know where I am. And don't think I don't. Jack Sparrow. Hector. It's been too long, hasn't it? Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember? You shot me. No, I didn't. Tia Dalma, out and about, eh? You add an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium. He thinks we're a hallucination. William, tell me something. Have you come because you need my help to save a certain distressing damsel? Rather, damsel in distress? - Either one. - No. Well, then you wouldn't be here, would you? So you can't be here. Q.E.D., you're not really here. Jack. This is real. We're here. - The Locker you say? - Aye. We've come to rescue you. Have you now? That's very kind of you. But it would seem that as I possess a ship and you don't, you're the ones in need of rescuing, and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood. I see my ship. Right there. Can't spot it. Must be a tiny little thing hiding somewhere behind the Pearl. Jack, Cutler Beckett has the heart of Davy Jones. He controls the Flying Dutchman. - He's taking over the seas. - The song has already been sung. The Brethren Court is called. Leave you people alone for a minute, look what happens. Everything's gone to pot. Aye, Jack. The world needs you back something fierce. And you need a crew. Why should I sail with any of you? Four of you have tried to kill me in the past. One of you succeeded. She's not told you. You'll have loads to talk about while you're here. As for you... Now, don't tell me you didn't enjoy it at the time. Fair enough. All right, you're in. Don't need you. You scare me. Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Cotton. Cotton's parrot, I'm a little iffy. But at least I'll have someone to talk to. - Who are you? - Tai Huang. These are my men. Where do your allegiances lie? With the highest bidder. I have a ship. That makes you the highest bidder. Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands. Prepare to make sail. Jack. Which way you going, Jack? Trim that sail. Slack windward brace and sheet. - Haul the pennant line. - Haul that pennant line. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? - No, what are you doing? - What are you doing? - No, what are you doing? - What are you doing? - Captain gives orders on a ship. - The captain of the ship is giving orders. - My ship, makes me captain. - They be my charts. That makes you ""chart-man."" Stow it! The both of you! That's an order! Understand? Sorry. I just thought with the captain issue in doubt, I'd throw in my name for consideration. Sorry. - I'd vote for you. - Yeah. You left Jack to the Kraken. He's rescued now. It's done with. Will, I had no choice. You chose not to tell me. I couldn't. It wasn't your burden to bear. But I did bear it, didn't I? I just didn't know what it was. I thought... You thought I loved him. If you make your choices alone, how can I trust you? You can't. Eerie That's downright macabre. I wonder what would happen if you dropped a cannonball on one of them. Be disrespectful it would. They should be in the care of Davy Jones. That was the duty him was charged with by the goddess Calypso. To ferry those who die at sea to the other side. And every ten years, him could come ashore to be with she who love him. Truly. But the man has become a monster. So he wasn't always tentacle-y? No. Him was a man. Once. Now there's boats coming. They're not a threat to us. Am I right? We are nothing but ghosts to them. It's best just let them be. It's my father. We've made it back. Father! Father, here! Look here! Elizabeth. We're not back. Father! Elizabeth. Are you dead? No. No. I think I am. No, you can't be. There was this chest, you see. It's odd. At the time, it seemed so important. Come aboard. And a heart. I learned that if you stab the heart, yours must take its place and you will sail the seas for eternity. The Dutchman must have a captain. Silly thing to die for. Someone, cast a line. Come back with us! A touch of destiny. Take the line. - I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth. - The line! Take the line! - She must not leave the ship! - Father! Please come with us! Please! I won't leave you! - I'll give your love to your mother, shall I? - Please, I won't let you go! Elizabeth. Is there a way? Him at peace. No water. Why is all but the rum gone? Rum's gone too. If we cannot escape these doldrums before night, I fear we will sail on trackless seas doomed to roam the reach between worlds forever. With no water, forever looks to be arriving a mite too soon. Why doesn't he do something? - Me eye. Give it back. - There's no sense to it. And the green flash happens at sunset, not sunrise. Over the edge. It's driving me over the blooming edge. Sunrises don't set. ""Up is down."" Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful. Why are these things never clear? - Clear as mud, Jackie. - What? Stab the heart. - Don't stab the heart. - Come again? The Dutchman must have a captain. Well, that's even more than less than unhelpful. Sail the seas for eternity. - I love the sea. - What about port? - I prefer rum. Rum's good. - Making port. Where we can get rum and salty wenches once every ten years. - What did he say'? - Once every ten years. Ten years is a long time, mate. Even longer given the deficit of rum. But eternity is longer still. And how will you be spending it? Dead? - Or not? - The immortal Captain Sparrow. I like that. Come sunset, it won't matter. Not sunset. Sundown. And rise. Up. What's that? What is that? I don't know. What do you think? - Where? - There. What is it? He's rocking the ship. We're rocking the ship. Aye. He's onto it. - He's rocking the ship. - We'll tie each other to the mast, upside down so when the boat flips, we'll be the right way up. Time it with the swell. Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats. Unstow the cargo. Let it shift. Now up is down. This was your idea. Blessed sweet Westerlies. We're back. It's the sunrise. Paey. We need our pistols. Get untied. Hurry. All right, then! The Brethren Court is gathering at Shipwreck Cove. And, Jack, you and I are going, and there will be no arguing that point. I is arguing the point. If there's pirates gathering, I'm pointing my ship the other way. The pirates are gathering to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate. Fight or not, you're not running, Jack. If we don't stand together, they'll hunt us down one by one till there will be none left but you. Quite like the sound of that. Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate. Aye. And you'll be fighting Jones alone. How does that figure into your plan? I'm still working on that. But I will not be going back to the Locker, mate. Count on that. Wet powder. Wait! We can still use them as clubs! Sorry. Effective, though. There's a freshwater spring on this island. We can resupply there and get back to shooting each other later. You lead the shore party. I'll stay with my ship. I'll not be leaving my ship in your command. Why don't you both go ashore and leave the ship in my command? Temporarily. Mind the boat. - Criminy. - Odds bodkins. Careful. Careful. You stupid fish. Actually, it's a cephalopod. Serves you right. Hey, I bet people would pay a shilling to see this. And another shilling for a sketch of them sitting atop! Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers. We could serve up a slice as a souvenir. Still thinking of running, Jack? Think you can outrun the world? You know, the problem with being the last of anything, by and by there be none left at all. Sometimes things come back, mate. We're living proof, you and me. Aye, but that's a gamble of long odds, ain't it? There's never a guarantee of coming back. But passing on, that's dead certain. Summoning the Brethren Court, then, is it? It's our only hope, lad. That's a sad commentary in and of itself. The world used to be a bigger place. The world's still the same. There's just less in it. Poisoned. Fouled by the body. Hey, I know him. He was in Singapore. - Singapore. - Captain! We got company! He's the captain. Sao Feng, you showing up here it is truly a remarkable coincidence. Jack Sparrow. You pay me great insult once. That doesn't sound like me. Shall we just call it square, then? Release her. She's not part of the bargain. And what bargain be that? You heard Captain Turner. Release her! Captain Turner? Aye, the perfidious rotter led a mutiny against us! I need the Pearl to free my father. That's the only reason I came on this voyage. Why didn't you tell me you were planning this? It was my burden to bear. He needs the Pearl. Captain Turner needs the Pearl. And you felt guilty. And you and your Brethren Court. Did no one come to save me just because they missed me? I'm standing over there with them. I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an old friend who wants to see you first. I'm not certain I can survive any more visits from old friends. Here is your chance to find out. Curious. Your friends appear to be quite desperate, Jack. Perhaps they no longer believe that a gathering of squabbling pirates can defeat the Flying Dutchman. And so despair leads to betrayal. But you and I are no strangers to betrayal, are we? It's not here, Jack. What? What isn't? The heart of Davy Jones is safely aboard the Dutchman and so unavailable for use as leverage to satisfy your debt to the good captain. By my reckoning, that account has been settled. By your death? And yet here you are. Close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream. That's how I get by. And if Davy Jones were to learn of your survival? Ship ho! Be on your guard, men. My men are crew enough. Company ship, Company crew. You agreed. The Black Pearl was to be mine. And so it was. Perhaps you'll consider an alternative arrangement, one which requires absolutely nothing from you but information. Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt. In exchange for fair compensation? Square my debt with Jones, guarantee my freedom. Of course. It's just good business. Were I in a divulgatory mood what then might I divulge? Everything. Where are they meeting? Who are the pirate lords? What is the purpose of the nine pieces of eight? Beckett agreed the Black Pearl was to be mine. Lord Beckett's not gonna give up the only ship that can outrun the Dutchman, is he? Shame they're not bound to honour the code of the Brethren, isn't it? Because honour's a hard thing to come by nowadays. There is no honour to remaining with the losing side. Leaving it for the winning side, that's just good business. The losing side, you say? They have the Dutchman. Now the Pearl! And what do the Brethren have? We have Calypso. Calypso. An old legend. No. The goddess herself, bound in human form. Imagine all the powers of seas brought to bear against our enemy. I intend to release her. But for that I need the Brethren Court. All the Court. You can keep Barbossa, the belligerent homunculus and his friend with the wooden eye both. And Turner. Especially Turner. The rest go with me aboard the Pearl, and I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove where I will hand you the pirates and you will not hand me to Jones. Bloody fair deal, don't you think? And what becomes of Miss Swann? What interest is she to you? What are you proposing, captain? What be accepted, captain? - The girl. - What? Jack, I've just recalled. I've got this wonderful compass which points to whatever I want. So for what do I need you? Elizabeth is not part of any bargain. Out of the question. It was not a question. Points to the thing you want most. And that is not the Brethren Court, is it? Then what is, Jack? Me. Dead. - Done. - What? - Not done. - You got us into this. If this frees us, then done. Damn. Although, if I kill you, then I can use the compass to find Shipwreck Cove, is it, on my own. Cut out the middleman, as it were. Elizabeth, they are pirates. I have had more than enough experience dealing with pirates. Then we have an accord. With me killed, you'd arrive at the Cove, find it a stronghold nigh impregnable, able to withstand blockade for years, and then you'd be wishing: ""Oh, if only there was someone I had not killed inside to ensure that the pirates then come outside."" And you can accomplish all this, can you? You may kill me, but you may never insult me. Who am I? I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. Done. You're mad. Thank goodness for that, because if I wasn't, this would probably never work. And that was without even a single drop of rum. Send this pestilent, traitorous, cow-hearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig. Which ship do we follow? Signal the Dutchman to track down Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl. How soon can we have the ship ready to pursue? She's coming down! Do you think he plans it all out or just makes it up as he goes along? By this time tomorrow, we will arrive at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free. Calypso. Excuse me? Not a name you fancy, I imagine, out of the many that you have, but it is what we call you. We being who? You confirm it. Confirm what? You've told me nothing. The Brethren Court, not I. The first Brethren Court, whose decision I would have opposed, they bound you to human form so the rule of the seas would belong to man, and not... To me. But one such as you should never be anything less than what you are. Pretty speech from a captor, but words whispered through prison bars lose their charm. Can I be blamed for my efforts? All men are drawn to the sea, perilous though it may be. And some men offer desire as justification for their crimes. I offer simply my desire. And in return? I would have your gifts should you choose to give them. And if I should choose not? Then I will take your fury. Sao Feng? Here. Please. With all nine pieces of eight, you will be free. Take it! You are captain now. Me? Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove. Captain, the ship is taken. We cannot- Forgive me, Calypso. What did he tell you? He made me captain. Fire! You are not my captain. Elizabeth. James. James. Thank God, you're alive. Your father will be overjoyed to know you're safe. My father's dead. No, that can't be true. He returned to England. Did Lord Beckett tell you that? Who among you do you name as captain? Captain. Her. - Captain? - Tow the ship. Put the prisoners in the brig. The captain shall have my quarters. Thank you, sir. But I prefer to remain with my crew. Elizabeth, I swear - I did not know. - Know what? Which side you chose? Well, now you do. Bootstrap? Bootstrap. Bill Turner? Bootstrap. You know my name. Yes. I know your son. Will Turner. William. He made it. He's alive. And now he sends you to tell me that he's coming to get me. God's wounds. He's on his way. Yes, Will is alive. And he wants to help you. He can't help me. He won't come. But you're his father. I know you. He spoke of you. He can't save me. He can't come because of you. Me? You're Elizabeth. Yes, I'm Elizabeth. If Jones be slain, he who slays him must take his place. Captain forever. The Dutchman must always have a captain. And if he saves me, he loses you. I see. He won't pick me. I wouldn't pick me. Tell him not to come. Tell him to stay away. Tell him it's too late. I'm already a part of the ship. And the crew. Bootstrap. You know my name. You know my name. Yes, I know your son. William. He's coming for me. Wait and see. You'll see. He promised. Swing her over. Ready those lines. Sir. A breadcrumb trail. And we're meant to follow. A betrayer among them? Ur a trap? A gambit by a skilled opponent. Adjust course, lieutenant. Sir? We can only hope to reach our destination before they run out of bodies. You escaped the brig even quicker than I expected. William, do you notice anything? Rather, do you notice something that is not there to be noticed? - You haven't raised an alarm. - Odd, isn't it? Not as odd as this. Come up with this all by your lonesome, did you? I said to myself, ""Think like Jack."" This is what you've arrived at? Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove so as to gain his trust? Accomplish your own ends? It's like you don't know me at all, mate. And how does your dearly beloved feel about this plan? You've not seen fit to trust her with it. I'm losing her, Jack. Every step I make for my father is a step away from Elizabeth. Mate, if you choose to lock your heart away, you'll lose her for certain. Now, if I might lend a machete to your intellectual thicket, avoid the choice altogether. Change the facts. Let someone else dispatch Jones. Who? You? Death has a curious way of reshuffling one's priorities. I slip aboard the Dutchman, find the heart, stab the beating thing, your father goes free from his debt, you're free to be with your charming murderess. And you're willing to out out your heart and bind yourself to the Dutchman? Forever? No, mate. I'm free forever. Free to sail the seas beyond the edges of the map, free from death itself. You have to do the job, though, Jack. You have to ferry souls to the next world or end up just like Jones. I don't have the face for tentacles. But immortal has to count for something, eh? What's this for? Think like me. It'll come to you. My regards to Davy Jones. I hate him. Come with me. Quickly. What are you doing? Choosing a side. Quickly. Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett knows of the meeting of the Brethren. I fear there may be a traitor among them. It's too late to earn my forgiveness. I had nothing to do with your father's death. That does not absolve me of my other sins. Come with us. James, come with me. Who goes there? Go. I Will follow. You're lying. Our destinies have been entwined, Elizabeth, but never joined. Go now. Back to your station, sailor. No one leaves the ship. Stand down. That's an order. That's an order. Part of the crew, part of the ship. Part of the crew, part of the ship. - Part of the crew, part of the ship. - Steady. Part of the crew, part of the ship. All hands, prisoner escape! - Belay that! - James! James! No! - The admiral's dead. - Admiral's dead? - Admiral's dead. - The admiral's dead. - To the captain's cabin! - Aye! - Captain's cabin. - The captain's cabin. James Norrington, do you fear death? I take that as a no. Nice sword. The Dutchman is under my command. For now. Look alive and keep a weather eye. Not for nought it's called Shipwreck Island where lies Shipwreck Cove and the Town of Shipwreck. You heard him. Step lively. You know, for all that pirates are clever cogs, we are an unimaginative lot - when it comes to naming things. - Right. I once sailed with a geezer, lost both of his arms, part of his eye. What'd you call him? Larry. I do not renege on a bargain once struck but we agreed on ends only. The means are mine to decide. Caution, Barbossa. Do not forget it was by my power you return from the dead or what it mean if you fail me. Don't you forget why you had to bring me back, why I could not leave Jack to his well-deserved fate. It took nine pirate lords to bind you, Calypso, and it'll take no less than nine to set you free. Masters Pintel, Ragetti. Take this fishwife to the brig. Right this way, Mrs. Fish. I cannot be summoned like some mongrel pup. Apparently, you can. I believe you know each other. Come to join my crew again, Master Turner? Not yours. His. Jack Sparrow sends his regards. Sparrow? You didn't tell him? We rescued Jack from the Locker along with the Black Pearl. What else have you not told me? There is an issue far more troublesome. I believe you're familiar with a person called Calypso. Not a person. A heathen god. One who delights in cursing men with their wildest dreams and then revealing them to be hollow and nought but ash. The world is well rid of her. Not quite so well, actually. The Brethren Court intends to release her. No. They cannot. The first court promised to imprison her forever. That was our agreement. Your agreement? I showed them how to bind her. She could not be trusted. I... She gave me no choice. We must act before they release her. You loved her. She's the one. And then you betrayed her. She pretended to love me. She betrayed me. And after which betrayal did you cut out your heart, I wonder? Do not test me. I hadn't finished that. You will free my father. And you will guarantee Elizabeth's safety along with my own. Your terms are steep, Mr. Turner. We will expect fair value in return. There is only one price I will accept: Calypso murdered. Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl. Jack has sailed the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove. And with you no longer aboard her how do you propose to lead us there? What is it you want most? Look at them all. There's not been a gathering like this in our lifetime. And I owe them all money. As he who issued summons, I convene this, the fourth Brethren Court. To confirm your lordship and right to be heard, present now your pieces of eight, my fellow captains. Those aren't pieces of eight. They're just pieces of junk. Aye. The original plan was to use nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso, but when the first court met, the brethren were to a one skint broke. So change the name. What? To ""nine pieces of whatever we happen to have in our pockets at the time""? Oh, yes, that sounds very pirate-y. Master Ragetti, if you will. I kept it safe for you, just like you said when you gave it to me. Aye, you have. Now I need it back. Sparrow? Might I point out that we are still short one pirate lord and I'm as content as a cucumber to wait until Sao Feng joins us. Sao Feng is dead. - He fell to the Flying Dutchman. - The plagued ship. He made you captain? They're just giving the bloody title away now. Listen. Listen to me. Our location has been betrayed. Jones is under the command of Lord Beckett. They're on their way here. Who is this betrayer? Not likely anyone among us. - Where's Will? - Not among us. And it matters not how they found us. The question is, ""What will we do now that they have?"" We fight. Shipwreck Cove is a fortress. A well-supplied fortress. There is no need to fight if they cannot get to us. There be a third course. In another age, at this very spot, the first Brethren Court captured the sea goddess and bound her in her bones. That was a mistake. Oh, we tamed the seas for ourselves, aye. But opened the door to Beckett and his ilk. Better were the days when mastery of seas came not from bargains struck with eldritch creatures but from the sweat of a man's brow and the strength of his back alone. You all know this to be true. Gentlemen, ladies, we must free Calypso. - Shoot him. - Cut out his tongue. Shoot him, and cut out his tongue, and shoot his tongue. And trim that beard. Sao Feng would have agreed with Barbossa. - Aye. - Calypso was our enemy then. She will be our enemy now. And it's unlikely her mood's improved. I would still agree with Sao Feng. We release Calypso. - You threaten me? - I silence you. - This is madness. - This is politics. Meanwhile, our enemies are bearing down upon us. If they not be here already. My sweet. You come for me. You were expecting me. It has been torture trapped in this single form, cut off from the sea, from all that I love, from you. Ten years I devoted to the duty you charged me. Ten years I looked after those who died at sea. And finally, when we could be together again, you weren't there. Why weren't you there? Is my nature. Would you love me if I was anything but what I am? I do not love you. Many things you were, Davy Jones, but never cruel. You have corrupted your purpose, and so yourself. And you did hide away what should always have been mine. Calypso. I will be free. And when I am, I will give you my heart and we will be together always. If only you had a heart to give. Why did you come? And what fate have you planned for your captors? The Brethren Court? All of them, the last thing they will learn in this life is how cruel I can be. And what of your fate, Davy Jones? My heart will always belong to you. It was the first court what imprisoned Calypso. We should be the ones to set her free. And in her gratitude she will see fit to grant us boons. Whose boons? Your boons? Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I. If you have a better alternative, please, share. Cuttlefish. Aye. Let us not, dear friends, forget our dear friends the cuttlefish. Flipping glorious little sausages. Pen them up together and they will devour each other without a second thought. Human nature, isn't it? Or fish nature. So yes, we could hole up here well provisioned and well armed and half of us would be dead within the month, which seems quite grim to me, any way you slice it. Or... ...as my learned colleague so naively suggests, we can release Calypso and we can pray that she will be merciful. I rather doubt it. Can we, in fact, pretend that she is anything other than a woman scorned like which fury hell hath no? We cannot. We are left with but one option. I agree with, and I cannot believe the words are coming out of me mouth, Captain Swann. We must fight. - You've always run away from a fight. - Have not. - You have so. You have so. - Have not. Have not. You have so, and you know it. Have not. Slander and calumny. I have only ever embraced that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions. I submit that here now that is what we all must do. We must fight to run away. - Aye! - Aye! - Aye! - Aye! As per the code, an act of war, and this be exactly that, can only be declared by the pirate king. - You made that up. - Did I, now? I call on Captain Teague, keeper of the code. Sri Sumbhajee proclaims this all to be folly. Hang the code. Who cares a... Code is the law. You're in my way, boy. - The code. - The code. As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew. That can't... How did...? Sea turtles, mate. Sea turtles? Barbossa is right. Hang on a minute. ""It shall be the duties of the king to declare war, parley with shared adversaries."" Fancy that. There has not been a king since the first court and that's not likely to change. - Not likely. - Why not? See, the pirate king is elected by popular vote. And each pirate only ever votes for hisself. I call for a vote. I vote for Ammand the Corsair. Capitaine Chevalle, the penniless Frenchman. Sri Sumbhajee votes for Sri Sumbhajee. Mistress Ching. Gentleman Jocard. Elizabeth Swann. - Barbossa. - Vallenueva. Elizabeth Swann. - What? - I know. Curious, isn't it? You're going to vote for me. You're going to vote for me, sir. No! Am I to understand that you lot will not be keeping to the code, then? Very well. What say you, Captain Swann, King of the Brethren Court? Prepare every vessel that floats. At dawn, we're at war. And so we shall go to war. What? You've seen it all, done it all. You survived. That's the trick, isn't it? To survive? It's not just about living forever, Jackie. The trick is living with yourself forever. How's Mum? She looks great. The enemy is here! Let's take them! Abandon ship. Abandon ship. Paey? You be the cur that led these wolves to our door. Don't blame Turner. He was merely the tool of your betrayal. If you wish to see its grand architect, look to your left. My hands are clean in this. Figuratively. My actions were my own and to my own purpose. - Jack had nothing to do with it. - Well spoke. Listen to the tool. Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman. I understand the burden you bear, but I fear that cause is lost. No cause is lost if there is but one fool left to fight for it. If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf, then how did he come to give me this? You made a deal with me, Jack, to deliver the pirates, and here they are. Don't be bashful. Step up. Claim your reward. Your debt to me is still to be satisfied. One hundred years in servitude aboard the Dutchman, as a start. That debt was paid, mate. With some help. You escaped. - Technically- - I propose an exchange. Will leaves with us, and you can take Jack. Done. - Undone. - Done. Jack's one of the nine pirate lords. You have no right. King. As you command, your nibs. Blackguard! If you have something to say, I might be saying something as well. First to the finish, then? Do you fear death? You've no idea. Advise your brethren you can fight, and all of you will die, or you can not fight, in which case only most of you will die. You murdered my father. He chose his own fate. And you have chosen yours. We will fight, and you will die. So be it. King? Of the Brethren Court. Courtesy of Jack. Maybe he really does know what he's doing. Bravo! You've successfully arrived aboard the Flying Dutchman as per the overall scheme. - Look... - Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate. Except for this little sojourn in the brig, it's utter clockwork. Go away. - What? Back to the Locker? - Not without you, Jackie. Stab the heart. Live forever as captain of the Flying Dutchman. Then again, if you're in the brig, who's to stab the heart? Does seem to put immortality a bit out of reach. Peanut We'll use the Black Pearl as a flagship to meet the attack. - Will we, now? - All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on. Barbossa, you can't release her. We need to give Jack a chance. Apologies, Your Majesty. Too long my fate has not been in me own hands. No longer. The enemy has opted for oblivion. Ready the fleet. - To your stations! - To your stations! Be there some manner of rite or incantation? Aye. The items brought together, done. Items to be burned, and someone must speak the words, ""Calypso, I release you from your human bonds."" Is that it? 'Tis said it must be spoken as if to a lover. Calypso, I release you from your human bonds. Is that it? No, no. He didn't say it right. You have to say it right. Calypso, I release you from your human bonds. Tia Dalma. Calypso. When the Brethren Court first imprisoned you, who was it that told them how'? Who was it that betrayed you? Name him. Davy Jones. This is it. This is it. Calypso! I come before you as but a servant, humble and contrite. I have fulfilled me vow and now ask your favour. Spare meself, me ship, me crew, but unleash your fury upon those who dare pretend themselves your masters, or mine. Is that it? Why, she's no help at all. What now? Nothing. Our final hope has failed us. It's not over. - There's still a fight to be had. - We've an armada against us. And with the Dutchman, there's no chance. There's only a fool's chance. Revenge won't bring your father back, Miss Swann, and it's not something I'm intending to die for. You're right. Then what shall we die for? You will listen to me. Listen! The Brethren will still be looking here to us, to the Black Pearl to lead. And what will they see? Frightened bilge rats aboard a derelict ship? No. No, they will see free men and freedom! And what the enemy will see is the flash of our cannons. They will hear the ring of our swords, and they will know what we can do. By the sweat of our brows, and the strength of our backs, and the courage of our hearts. Gentlemen, hoist the colours. Hoist the colours. - Hoist the colours. - Hoist the colours! Aye. The wind's on our side, boys. That's all we need! Hoist the colours! We have a favourable wind, sir. Oh, so we do. Signal Jones to give no quarter. That should brighten his day. To arms! We give no quarter! Calypso. Have you noticed on top of everything it's raining? That's a bad sign. Man the capstan. Raise the main top yard. Keep that powder dry. Maelstrom! Captain Barbossa! We need you at the helm. Aye, that be true. Brace up yards, you cack-handed deck apes! Dying is the day worth living for! Veer off! She'll not harm us. Full bore and into the abyss. Are you mad? You afraid to get wet? She's on our stern and gaining. More speed! Haul your wind and hold your water. Bow cannons! Bow the cannons! Take us out, or they'll overbear us. Nay. Further in. We'll cut across to faster waters. Prepare to broadside. - Captain the guns. Bear ahead. - Muster your courage, men. At the ready. Think like the whelp. Think like the whelp. Think like the whelp. Hinges. Hinges. Hinges. - Half-barrel hinges. - Leverage. Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it. - I miss him already. - He is quite charming, isn't he? Nobody move. I dropped me brain. Batten down the hatches! Stand to your guns! Midship cannoneers, sight the masts! Main battery at the ready! Hold there. Wait till we're board-and-board. Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire all! Fire! Fire! Come on, men! It be too late to alter course now, mateys. Halt there, or we'll shoot. Good one. I just come to get me effects. Admirable though it may be, why are you here when you could be elsewhere? Someone has to stay and guard the chest. There's no question. There has been a breakdown in military discipline aboard this vessel. - I blame the fish people. - Oh, so fish people, by dint of being fish people, automatically aren't as disciplined as non-fish people? Seems contributory is all I'm suggesting. It is true, if there were no fish people there'd be no need to guard the chest. And if there were no chest, we wouldn't need to be here to guard it. Come on, men. Come on! Prepare to board! Cover! No. Lookie here, boys. A lost bird. A lost bird that never learned to fly. To my great regret. But... ...never too late to learn, eh? The chest. Hand it over. I can set you free, mate. My freedom was forfeit long ago. Elizabeth. Elizabeth. Will you marry me? I don't think now is the best time. Now may be the only time. I love you. I've made my choice. What's yours? Barbossa! Marry us! I'm a little busy at the moment! Barbossa, now! Fine then. Dearly beloved, we be gathered here today, to nail your gizzards to the mast, you poxy cur. Elizabeth Swann, do you take me to be your husband? - I do. - Great. Will Turner, do you take me to be your wife, in sickness and in health, with health being the less likely? I do. As captain, I now pronounce you... You may kiss... You may kiss... Just kiss. Leave it. You can do nothing without the key. I already have the key. No, you don't. Oh, that key. No! My Pistol. Turner. Fire! Thank you, Jack. It's me. It's Will. Your son. Go! Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me! That's why I brought this. I'm not going to kill you. I made you a promise. Mister, did you forget? I'm a heartless wretch. Love. A dreadful bond. And yet, so easily severed. Tell me, William Turner, do you fear death? Do you? Heady tonic, holding life and death in the palm of one's hand. You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow. Cruel is a matter of perspective. Is it? Will. Look at me. Stay with me. You're all right. William. My son. Will. Will, look at me. Look at me! You will not forestall my judgment Calypso. She's taking us down! Make quick, or it's the Locker for us all! No.No.No! Part of the ship, part of the crew. Part of the ship, part of the crew. - Part of the ship, part of the crew. - Don't leave me. I won't leave you. The Dutchman must have a captain. Hold on. Thank goodness, Jack. The armada is still out there. The Endeavour is coming up hard to starboard and I think it's time we embrace that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions. Never actually been one for tradition. Close haul her. Luff the sails and lay her in iron. - Belay that! Or we'll be a sitting duck. - Belay that ""belay that."" - But, captain... - Belay. Belay. Stow. Stow. Shut it. What are they waiting for? He expects us to honour our agreement. Ready guns and gun ports. It's nothing personal, Jack. It's just good business. She survived. Ready on the guns. - Full canvas. - Full canvas! Aye, full canvas! Orders, sir. Sir! Captain. - Fire. - Fire! Fire! - Fire! - Fire! Orders! Orders, sir! Sir, what do you command? It's just... ...good business. Abandon ship! - Abandon ship! - All hands, abandon ship! They're turning away! Wind in your sails. Shiver me timbers! - Mr. Gibbs. - Captain? - You may throw my hat if you like. - Aye, aye, captain. Hooray! Now go and get it. Orders, sir? You're no longer bound to the Dutchman. - You're free. - Aye. That's a fine thing, but by my reckoning, I still have a debt that has to be paid. If you'll have me. On the wheel then, Mr. Turner. Aye, Captain Turner. This ship has a purpose again. And where we are bound, she cannot come. One day ashore. Ten years at sea. It's a steep price for what's been done. Depends on the one day. Your chariot awaits, Your Highness. The oars are inside. Mrs. Turner. Goodbye, poppet. Jack. It would never have worked out between us. Keep telling yourself that, darling. Once was quite enough. Thank you. I'm gonna need the other one. It's nearly sunset. It's always belonged to you. Will you keep it safe? Yes. Yes. Will! Keep a weather eye on the horizon. Granted it tends to list to port and has been, on occasion, known to frighten young women. But I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Is that it? The Black Pearl? It's not very big. Love, that is a dinghy. My vessel is magnificent and fierce and huge-ish and gone. Why is it gone? Is that it there? Yes, there it is. Why is it there? - It's much larger up close. - Jack, you promised to take us for a ride. I was to be given the first ride. What? You? - That's what he said. - I never! Mr. Gibbs, any particular reason why my ship is gone? The ship? We're on the ship. Jack! The ship's gone! Really? Ladies! Will you please shut it? Listen to me. Yes, I lied to you. No, I don't love you. Of course it makes you look fat. I've never been to Brussels. It is pronounced ""egregious."" By the way, no, I've never actually met Pizarro, but I love his pies. All of this pales to utter insignificance in light of the fact that my ship is once again gone. Savvy? - Take what you can. - Give nothing back. Tell me, ladies, - what do you know of sea turtles? - Sea turtles? You want a taste of this? That's a good boy. You're daddy's boy. Yes, you are. Sir? Some of the men don't feel entirely settled about leaving Captain Jack behind. - Again. - Again. Is that so? It would make us feel a whole lot better regarding our fortunes if we could see that item you told us about. On the charts. - Aye. - With our own eyes. To help put an ease to our burden of guilt, so to speak. Feast your eyes upon this, mateys. There's more than one way to live forever. Gents, I give you the Fountain of Youth. Sparrow. Yo-ho, yo-ho A pirate's life for me We're devils and black sheep Really bad eggs Drink up me hearties, yo-ho Yo-ho, yo-ho A pirate's life for me We pillage, we plunder, we rifle and loot Drink up me hearties, yo-ho We kidnap and ravage And don't give a hoot Drink up me hearties, yo-ho Yo-ho, yo-ho A pirate's life for me, You will travel far, my little Kal-El. But we will never leave you... ... even in the face of our deaths. You will make my strength your own. You will see my life through your eyes... ... as your life will be seen through mine. The son becomes the father, and the father the son. In spite of your past... ...I know you're a good man. And all good men... ...deserve a second chance. From the moment I received your first letter... ...I knew you were not like the rest. You came from nothing... ...and you worked so hard to get where you are. You might have made a few mistakes. - Gertrude, for God's sake! - Damn it, Gertrude, let us in now! You said that if I helped you get out of prison... ...you'd take care of me. And you have. You've shown me pleasures that I've never known. That's why you deserve... ...everything. I love you... ...Lex Luthor. Gertrude, let us in. He's a crook. He doesn't love you, Gertrude! He's a monster! Gertrude! - You can keep that. - Oh, God. The rest is mine. We're done. Bye, Martha. Oh, Clark. Oh, my boy. Will you get that thing out of my face! Lex, your friends give me the creeps. Prison is a creepy place, Kitty. One needs to make creepy friends in order to survive. Even a man with my vast talents is worth less inside... ...than a carton of cigarettes and a sharp piece of metal in your pocket. Do you know the story of Prometheus? No, of course you don't. Prometheus was a god who stole the power of fire from the other gods... ...and gave control of it to mortals. In essence, he gave us technology. He gave us power. So we're stealing fire? In the Arctic. Actually, sort of. You see, whoever controls technology controls the world. The Roman Empire ruled the world because they built roads. The British Empire ruled the world because they built ships. America, the atom bomb, and so on and so forth. I just want what Prometheus wanted. Sounds great, Lex, but you're not a god. Gods are selfish beings who fly around in little red capes... ...and don't share their power with mankind. Hey, boss. We found something. No, I don't wanna be a god. I just wanna bring fire to the people. And I want my cut. Was this his house? You might think so. Most would. This is more of a monument to a long dead... ...and extremely powerful civilization. This is where he learned who he was. This is where he came for guidance. Possibilities. Endless possibilities. You act like you've been here before. My son... ... you do not remember me. I am Jor-El. I'm your father. By now, I will have been dead many thousands of your years. - He thinks I'm his son. - You are the only survivor of Krypton. Embedded in the crystals before you is the total accumulation of all literature... ... and scientific fact from dozens of other worlds... ... spanning the 28 known galaxies. There are questions to be asked. Here in this... This Fortress of Solitude... ... we shall try to find the answers together. Can he see us? No, he's dead. So, my son... ... Kal-El... ... speak. Tell me everything... ...starting with crystals. Hey, boy. - On Tuesday, between support... - hindered the firefighting efforts for all those... Police have finally arrived and it's still complete mayhem down here. Fighting broke out in the southernmost region... ... with border fire and small-arms attacks prevalent. Don't worry, I buried it this morning. - It was futile trying to force him to testify before a grand jury. Mom? Five years. If your father was alive, he never would have let you go. I almost gave up hope. I just thought I would never see you again. Oh, Clark. Did you find what you were looking for? I thought, hoped... ...it might still be there. Your home? That place was a graveyard. I'm all that's left. Clark, the universe is a big place. And you don't know who's out there. And even if you are the last... ...you're not alone. I know. - Sorry. - Look out! Watch out, will you? - Excuse me. - Sorry. Sorry. Great. Would you be careful? - Jimmy. - Mr. Clark! I mean, Kent! Mr. Kent! Welcome back! Oh, my God! Hey, come... Wait right there. I'll be right back. Oh, hey, sorry, guys, I'm still looking for a place to live... ...if you know of anything reasonable. Behind you, Mr. Kent. I made it myself. It's a cake. Oh, it looks... ...delicious. Olsen! Where are the photos of that birthday-clown-massacre thing? I'm on it, chief. Hey, look who's back. - Kent? - Hey, chief. - Thank you for giving me my job back. - Don't thank me. Thank Norm Palmer for dying. It was his time. - Let's get you set up, huh? - Olsen! Okay, so I gotta run... ...but I will be back to check on you in a sec, Mr. Kent. Oh, hey, do you know where I can find Lois? The timing of this automated-ignition countdown... ... is the most precarious part of the launch. Lois Lane, Daily Planet. You also stated that the shuttle will usher in a new era of travel... ... enabling the average person to afford transcontinental flights. But can you tell us the exact price... ... an ""average person"" will be expected to pay? The answer to that question is in your press packet. The Earth is surrounded by a blanket of air... ... which we call the atmosphere. It reaches over... Yeah. He looks just like his mom. Already takes after her too, especially when it comes to getting into trouble. Mother? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you've been gone. Fearless reporter Lois Lane is a mommy. Oh, you know, I'll just... I'll take that. That's good. - Sorry. - No. She's got plenty. - Wait, she's married? - Yes. No. Not really. It's more like a prolonged engagement. But don't ask Miss Lane when they're tying the knot... ...because she hates that question. - Like this follow the same stringent safety guidelines set by NASA? Since this is a joint venture with the Air Force... You all right? You look like you could use a drink. This place is so tacky. Why are we back here? Kitty, while you were doing your nails and ordering fur coats online... ...I was busy unlocking the secrets... ...of one of the most advanced civilizations in the universe. Weren't there two of those? You see, unlike our clunky earthbound forms of construction... ...the technology on Krypton, Superman's home world... ...was based on manipulating the growth of crystals. Sounds like hocus-pocus to me. Well, naturally, to the primitive mind, any sufficiently advanced technology... ...would be indistinguishable from magic. But imagine: Cities, vehicles, weapons... ...entire continents... ...all grown. To think that one could create a new world... ...with such a simple little object. It's like a seed. And all it needs is water. Like... ...Sea-Monkeys. Exactly, Kitty. Like Sea-Monkeys. Clark has been doing a little soul-searching for the last couple years. - He saw llamas. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Must be tough coming back. - Coming back? - To work. Yeah. Well, you know, things change. I mean, of course things change... ...but sometimes things that you didn't think would change could change. Take Lois. A woman like her, I never thought she'd settle down. You know, if you ask me... Because she'll never tell you this... ...but if you ask me, she's still in love with you-know-who. The original space shuttle generated 7.5 million pounds of thrust... ...just in the initial launch phase. But, by piggybacking on this Boeing 777... Yes? If this launch is as pivotal as you claim... ...why is it being covered by one news network? Why don't we save those questions for the post-launch briefing. How about that, Miss Lane? When we hit 40,000 feet, the shuttle will detach, ascend... ...and then fire the first of two propellant systems, the liquid fuel boosters. When the shuttle reaches the stratosphere... ...the secondary insertion booster will fire... ...propelling the craft at 4gs into the mesosphere. - Careful. - I know. - Careful. Careful. - I know. Wow, that's really something, Lex. Wait for it. Wow, that's really something, Lex. It's freaking Gone With the Wind. - Shut off the camera. - But I'm getting it. I said, shut off the damn camera. I think I did something wrong. No. That wasn't you. Ignition is at T minus one minute and we are prepping for separation. CDR, start the clock. Three minutes and counting. Body signs normal. Crew is looking good. Shuttle readouts are holding steady. - We're still a go for launch. - Roger. - Houston, you copy? - Houston, do you copy? Oh, God. Electrical variance. What the...? Please, there's nothing to worry about. It seems that we are experiencing a slight power outage. - What did you do? - It wasn't me. It just cycled back up. Genesis, radio check from Houston. There we have it. We were experiencing a power outage. - Climbing to 40,000 feet. - Roger, 40,000 feet. And it's gone! A blazing fastball... Is that it? I don't think so. Dual engine failure, but they're up and running again. Genesis, I hate to say this, but it looks like we're gonna have to scrub the launch. - Aborting booster ignition. - Roger. Aborting booster ignition. Boosters are non-responsive. We're still counting down for ignition. - Platform, we have a problem. - Go. Looks like something faulted during the power outage. Both boosters are counting down for ignition. Platform, you have 30 seconds. - What? - Release couplings. We can't shut down boosters. We should be able to manage the launch and recover to the emergency field. T minus 23 seconds to ignition. Genesis, you're a go for evac procedures. Twenty-one, 20... ... 19... Couplings are non-responsive. - We're still attached. - Seventeen. - Platform, couplings are jammed. - Fifteen. Fourteen. Don't be alarmed. It's absolutely normal. We're still attached. Couplings are non-responsive. - Nine, eight... - Houston, can you do a remote override? ... seven... - Remote override is unresponsive. - ... six, five... - I repeat, remote override is unresponsive. ...four, three... And if you're lucky, you may hear the faint pop of the sonic boom. - Houston, we have ignition. - Roger, ignition. - This is Python 21, she's pulling away. - Okay, all flight control is on the... This is not a drill. Clear nonessential personnel. Switch to emergency band frequencies. Warning, warning. Oh, no! Oh, no! Can I get a little help? This is UPV breaking news. From Washington, Frank Jacobs. We've just received word... ... that the inaugural flight of the Genesis space shuttle... ... is experiencing a midair emergency. - A problem with the launch of the new orbital shuttle, Genesis. The reports are telling us the shuttle failed to disengage... ... sending both crafts rocketing towards space. We're now going live to Cape Canaveral for the latest update on this story. Jim, all we know right now... ... is that the couplings which hold the shuttle to the 777... ... malfunctioned and did not release as planned. - We're uncertain... - I should do... ... why the ignition sequence continued and boosters fired. However, there's speculation here that the blackout, which... Help me sit up. Mach one. Still tied to the shuttle at 42,000 feet. - Houston, we need some help. Houston! - Running diagnostics check. Stand by. Insertion booster ignition in five seconds. Warning, warning. What the hell is that? There's some kind of unidentified bogey coming from the north. - Roger that. - And it's coming in fast. Declaring an emergency. Overspeed, overspeed. Altitude... Do you see that? Fly up, fly up. Is everyone all right? Are you okay? Well, I hope this experience hasn't put any of you off flying. Statistically speaking, it's still the safest way to travel. Superman! Superman! Superman! Superman! Okay, everybody, listen up. I wanna know it all, everything. Olsen, I wanna see photos of him everywhere. No, I want the photos. Sports, how are they gonna get that plane out of the stadium? Travel, where did he go? Was he on vacation? If so, where? Gossip, has he met somebody? Fashion, is that a new suit? Health, has he gained weight? What's he been eating? Business, how is this gonna affect the stock market? Long-term, short-term. Politics, does he still stand for truth, justice, all that stuff? Lifestyle: ""Superman Returns."" Come on. Gil, how many F's in ""catastrophic""? None. What's the usage? ""This mysterious electromagnetic pulse knocked out portable devices... ...and entire power grids, causing a catastrophic event during..."" - Lois! - Yes. In my office. This goes for everyone. The story isn't the blackout, it's Superman! The story is the EMP, chief. Every electronic device on the East Coast goes dark. - First, are you okay? - Yes, thank you. Lois, three things sell papers: Tragedy, sex and Superman. People are sick of tragedy, we know you can't write worth a damn about sex. That means one thing. That one thing is Superman. And you know it, Lois. Lois? - Are you all right? You sure? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'm fine. - Thank God. - Where's Jason? - I don't know. Isn't he with you? - No. - Well, where is he? Hi. Hello. Who are you? I'm Clark Kent, an old friend of your mom's from before you were born. Really? She never mentioned you. Really? Never? - No. - Jason. - What are you doing here, honey? - Daddy's office is boring. Daddy's office is boring? Clark, hey! Welcome back. - I see you've already met the munchkin. - Yeah, we were just talking... - Did you take vitamins? Eye drops? - Yes. Yes. - Albuterol? Poly-Vi-Flor? - Yes. Yes, Mom. Good boy. He's a little fragile, but he's gonna grow up... ...to be big and strong like his dad, won't you? - Yes? - Yes. Oh, I saw you on the... Oh, yeah. That was nothing. - Hey, can I borrow your stapler? - Oh, yeah. Thanks. Congratulations on the Pulitzer. That's incredible. Yeah. Can you believe it? It's... So I wanna hear all about your trip. Where did you go? What did you see? Meet anyone special? Well, there's so much. Where to begin? Where's the little guy? Hey, kiddo. - How are you? - Good. Can you work some magic to get your uncle... ...to stop giving me such a hard time on this article? - Please? - Again? - Again. - You got it. - How are you, kiddo? - Good. Oh, this is Clark. - Clark, Richard. Richard, Clark. - Richard White. Hi. Richard's an assistant editor here who's basically saved our International section. He's also a pilot and he loves horror movies. Clark is... Well, he's Clark. Well, it's great to finally meet you. I've heard so much. - Oh, you have? - Yeah, Jimmy won't shut up about you. - Gotta run. - Where? You heard Perry. Superman's back, and he thinks I'm the only one equipped to... To what? - I don't know, you know. - So don't listen to him. I'm not. Going to the power plant to check out the blackout. Okay. - Bye, Mom. - Bye. - Bye, Lois. - And she's gone. No matter how close we are, that woman will always be a mystery. If you need anything, I'm right over there. Nice to finally meet you. Where do you wanna go? Wanna go to the park? And he's got the whole world In his hands He's got the whole world And he's got the whole world in his... Oh, he's cute. Run into trouble? - Should see the other guy. - What are we gonna do? Modify it, attach it to the stern. I don't care if the instructions are Russian. - Lois? - Hey, Clark. How does it feel to be back at work? Pretty good. You know, kind of like riding a bike, I guess. - A bike? - Yeah, you know... Never mind. But I was wondering... ...since I've gotten back, we haven't really had a chance to catch up. I thought maybe, if you'd like, we could go grab some food... - Hey, can I ask you something? - Sure. Have you ever met someone and it's like you're from different worlds... ...but you shared such a connection you knew you were destined to be together? Then he just takes off without explaining why... ...or without even saying goodbye? Sounds cheesy, I know. - Well, maybe... - Taxi! ...it was hard to say goodbye because he had to go... ...and he wanted to say goodbye, but maybe it was too difficult for him. Difficult? What's so difficult about it? ""Goodbye."" It's easy. What's so hard about saying goodbye? Who are we talking about? Nobody, just forget I said anything. Taxi! Hey! Taxi! Wow, thanks. 312 Riverside Drive, please. Good night, Clark. Superman! I want egg rolls. Nice try, kiddo. Only steamed chicken and snow peas for you. Why do we order Chinese if he's allergic? Because he loves the peas... ...and I think we all prefer egg rolls over macrobiotic shakes. It's a good point. So I noticed you've been acting a little different lately. Have I? You know, Lois, that article that you wrote. ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman""? No, no, no. No, the other one, from years ago, before we met. Which article? I wrote dozens about him. I was practically his press agent. ""I Spent the Night With Superman."" Richard, come on. It was the title of an interview. Plus, it was your Uncle Perry's idea. - No, I know, I know. It's okay, it's okay. - Richard. It was a long time ago. Were you in love with him? He was Superman. Everyone was in love with him. But were you? No. Lois, I shouldn't have brought it up. Even though you've been raised as a human being... ... you are not one of them. They can be a great people, Kal-El. They wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good... ... I have sent them you... ... my only son. Load them up. Holy sh... Attention, the Metropolis Museum of Natural History... ... will be closing in 10 minutes. We hope that you've... Sir, we're closing in 10 minutes. We only need five. You're done, the museum's closed. Thank you. Are you all right, miss? - My heart. I... I... - I'm sorry? I have a palpitation, a heart palpitation. And a murmur. Please, take me to the hospital. Take me to the hospital. Just hold on tight. Bingo. - There you are, ma'am. - My heart. My palpitations, they're gone. What did you do? I didn't do anything. Call me Katherine. Katherine. I'm glad you're feeling better. - You have places to go, people to save? - Yes. Would you like to get a cup of coffee sometime? - I know that's forward. Or a drink? - Good night. Good night. It's like this on every channel. He was in Manila at 10:55 p.m. And then spotted... - Hey, Kent, chief wants to see you. - Oh, thanks. But as this security footage from a simple deli robbery proves... ... there's really no feat too big or too small for the Man of Steel. Reports are flooding in from Metropolis, Houston, Gotham and as far... Satellites have proven most ineffective at tracking him. He might literally be moving near the speed of light. - Our map is illuminated with sightings... - Kent! - The chief is waiting. - ... on every continent, giving citizens... These are iconic, and they were taken by a 12-year-old with a camera phone. - What do you got, Olsen? - I got those. - Look, in the sky, chief. - It's a bird. - It's a plane. - No, look, it's... You wanted to see me? Yeah, Kent, come on in. Sit down. I wanna talk a little strategy. Okay. First off, Lois, I don't understand what you're doing... ...sneaking around covering the blackout. - It wasn't just a blackout. Cell phones, pagers, automobiles, airplane... Every other paper in town has got a female reporter... ...a good-looking female reporter, stashed on the roof covering Superman. - And you two are the ones with history. - Chief, I've done Superman. Covered him. You know what I mean. Yeah, that makes you an expert. Do him again. - There are a dozen other stories out there. - Yeah? Name one. Well, there was a museum robbery last night. Even Superman missed that one. He was too busy saving this hooker. Why don't you guys track down Lex Luthor? Well, no one's seen him since his fifth appeal. He's got more history with Superman than anyone. Maybe he's got something to say. - Luthor's yesterday's news. - No, I like that idea. Perry, Lex Luthor is a career criminal who nearly killed him, for God's sakes. Jimmy, how did Lex Luthor get out of prison? Well, the appeals court called Superman as a witness and he wasn't around. How much do you think that pisses off Superman? - Give him to someone else. - A lot. - A lot. - Polly. Give him to Polly. Lois, Superman. - What about the blackout? - Kent, blackout. Great. Thanks, chief. Lois, I'm sorry. I'd hate if this damaged our relationship. Relationship? - Yeah. - Hi, Mommy. - Hi, you. - Hey, guys. He got an A in science, but a D in gym, so we're doing something right. - Yeah, at least one of us is. - What? It's Perry. He just shoved Superman back into my life. Well, honey, I'm sure you can find a way to interview Superman... ...without bringing him back into your life. There's really no way around it, folks. Superman is back in all of our lives. We're coming to you from Sydney... ... where people have gathered on these rooftops to scour the sky... Okay, how about this? We'll stay late. We'll get dinner. I'll help with Superman, and you and Clark can work on the blackout together. - Is that all right with you, Clark? - Swell. I was gonna pretend the brakes were out. Pretend. Like we talked about. You didn't actually have to cut them! Of course I did. A man can always tell when a woman is pretending, especially Superman. So did you get your rock? I did. U.S. Coast Guard issuing a small-craft advisory for the Metropolis ocean area. High-wind advisory is in effect... ... ocean currents and tides becoming increasingly dangerous. All warnings lasting until later this evening. Security, security. This is U.S. Coast Guard issuing a small-craft advisory for northeast seas. Winds reaching 50 miles per hour, high tides in the morning. Waves reaching 20 to 30 feet. This warning is in effect for all small crafts for the next four hours. Weird. If these times are right... ...the blackout spread from a specific origin point. Where? I'm not sure yet. With the super-hearing, does he hear each sound by itself or everything at once? Both. - He's certainly taller than I thought. - 6'4"". I love that he can see through anything. I'd have fun with that. Anything but lead. - I bet he's... - 225 pounds... ...faster than a speeding bullet... ...draws his power from the sun, invulnerable to anything but kryptonite... ...and he never lies. - Kryptonite? Radioactive pieces of his home world. It's deadly. To him. Lois, how tall would you say Clark is? About 6'3"", 6'4"". About 200, 215 pounds? Jimmy, Jason, let's go get these intrepid reporters something to keep them going. - Burritos! - Come here, canhead. We're going this way. Do they have anything other than burritos? I think they have fries and burgers. So have you found a place to live yet? No. I'm still looking. You know, Lois, I wanted to ask you about that artic... Hey, I'm gonna run downstairs for some fresh air. Great! Thanks. - Let's talk when I get back. - Sure. You know, you really shouldn't smoke, Miss Lane. - Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you. - I'm fine. Really. I just wasn't expecting you. With all the press on the plane... ...I wasn't sure it was the best time for us to talk. Well, there's no press around now. Except for me, of course. I know people are asking questions now that I'm back. I think it's only fair that I answer those people. So you're here for an interview? Okay, then. - Where did I put that thing? - Right pocket. Let's start with the big question. - Where'd you go? - To Krypton. But you told me it was destroyed. Ages ago. It was. But when astronomers thought they found it... ...I had to see for myself. Well, you're back, and everyone seems to be pretty happy about it. Not everyone. - I read the article, Lois. - So did a lot of people. - Tomorrow they're giving me the Pulitzer... - Why did you write it? How could you leave us like that? I moved on. So did the rest of us. That's why I wrote it. The world doesn't need a savior. And neither do I. Lois. Will you come with me? Why? There's something I wanna show you. Please. I can't be gone long. You won't be. Clark said the reason you left without saying goodbye... ...is because it was too unbearable for you. Personally, I think that's a load of crap. - Clark? - He's just a guy I work with. Maybe Clark's right. You know, my... Richard, he's a pilot. He takes me up all the time. Not like this. I forgot how warm you were. Listen. What do you hear? Nothing. I hear everything. You wrote that the world doesn't need a savior... ...but every day I hear people crying for one. I'm sorry I left you, Lois. I'll take you back now. Richard's a good man. And you've been gone a long time. I know. I... So will I see you around? I'm always around. Good night, Lois. We're having beef, honey. Do you want the tofu wrap or the veggie wrap? You all right? Where have you been? I was up on the roof, getting some air. Tell the truth now. Were you smoking? No. Is this real? - Where'd you find him? - He found me. Oh, this is great. I can't wait to read it. So, Mr. White, about the blackout... Lois, this is the biggest night of your life. Have you picked out a dress? Something snazzy? It just feels a little weird winning for that article. - It just doesn't seem right. - What doesn't seem right? Winning an award for an article called ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."" When, according to this newspaper, they do. Lois, Pulitzer Prizes are like Academy Awards. Nobody remembers what you got one for. It's just that you got one. - But... - This is your night. You enjoy it. I'm sure Kent's on the blackout. Department of Water and Power, please. 7782, great. Metropolis Public Works. Hi, Stephen, Lois Lane from the Daily Planet. Blackout? I just need a little info on a few outstanding power grids. Yeah, I do have it here, actually. So the uptown grid went dark at 12:36 and midtown 10 seconds before. Which grid was hit first? It just reads Vanderworth. - Across the river? - 6 Springwood Drive. 6 Springwood Drive. A residence or a business? - Residence. - Sure? Nothing before that? - That's all it shows. - Thank you very much. Oh, Jason. - There's your mom, Jason. - You're late, Mommy. Where are we? Is this the Pulitzer? Nope. I've just gotta ask these people a few questions and then we can go. Can I stay in the car? No, honey. - Are we trespassing? - No. Yes. Hello? Hello? I like the curly one. Let's go. This was a bad idea. Lex Luthor. Lois Lane? You're bald. And what is your name? I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. - Cute kid, and smart. - Thanks. We're not really strangers, are we? This is kind of a little reunion. Heck, I'm a fan. I love your writing... ...and your dress. - I love your boat. How'd you get it? Swindle some widow out of her money? That's funny. Didn't you win the Pulitzer Prize... ...for my favorite article of all time, ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman""? Didn't you have a few more years to go on that double life sentence? Yes, well, we can thank the Man of Steel for that. I mean, he's really good at swooping in and catching the bad guys... ...but he's not so hot at the little things, like Miranda rights... ...due process, making your court date. Did you have anything to do with the blackout? Are you fishing for an interview, Miss Lane? It's been a while since you've been a headline. Maybe it's time people knew your name again. How about we turn this boat around, call a cab for my son... ...and then you can do whatever you want with me. No, I don't think we'll be turning around, Miss Lane... ...which means that we do have some time to kill. How about that interview? Yeah, just call me if you hear anything. Okay. Thank you. So, what did the school say? She picked him up at 3: 15. - Hi, I heard about Lois. - Yes, come in, Clark, come in. - Is there anything I can do? - Yeah, you're a reporter. - Help Richard track her down. - I'll check her computer. Excuse me, Clark. What do you know about crystals? They make great chandeliers. This crystal may seem unremarkable, but so is the seed of a redwood tree. It's how our mutual friend in tights made his Arctic getaway spot. Cute. It's a little small for my taste. You're building an island? You're not seeing the big picture here, Miss Lane. Let me enlarge it for you. Not just an island, an entirely new continent. An extinct world, reborn on our own. Why? Land, Miss Lane. I mean... Kitty, what did my father used to say to me? ""You're losing your hair""? - Before that. - ""Get out""? He said, ""You can print money... ...manufacture diamonds, and people are a dime a dozen... ...but they'll always need land."" It's the one thing they're not making any more of. But the United States... Will be underwater. It's simple physics, Miss Lane. Two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time. And the rest of the world will just let you keep it? - They'll... - They'll... ...what? I'll have advanced alien technology... ...thousands of years beyond what anyone could throw at me. Bring it on! And eventually... ...the rest of the world will be begging me... ...for a piece of high-tech beachfront property. In fact, they'll pay through the nose for it. But millions of people will die. Billions! Once again, the press underestimates me. This is front-page news. Come on, let me hear you say it just once. - You're insane. - No! Not that. No, the other thing. It's dangling off the tip of your tongue. Let me hear it just once, please? - Superman will never... - Wrong! What is that? I think you know exactly what this is. Mind over muscle, Miss Lane. Mind... Who is that boy's father? Richard. Mr. Luthor, we're approaching the coordinates. Are you sure? Yes, sir. Latitude 40 degrees north, longitude 73 degrees west. Don't let them leave this room. Kitty, come with me. You're not gonna want to miss this. - Damn it. - What? She has a password. ""Jason."" ""Richard."" Try ""Superman."" ""Superman."" Great. Don't touch that, honey. Why don't you go play the piano. Come on, come on, come on. Lex, this isn't like the train set. I know. Come on, come on. Come on. - Honey, are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you hurt? - I'm fine. Open this door! Open it! Could you help Mommy open the door? I'm sorry. It's gonna be okay. Okay? It's gonna be okay. We had a little problem downstairs. Brutus is dead. He got hit with the piano. Where's the boy? With the mother, locked up in the pantry. Oh, it's time for us to go. My camera's not working. And my phone's not working. - Okay, I'm good. - That was weird. Hey, guys. This just came through the fax. It's Lois' handwriting, I'd recognize it anywhere. I just... No idea what the numbers mean. - They're coordinates. - Coordinates. That's just off the coast. Jimmy, tell Perry I'm taking the seaplane. Keep trying her cell. What are these, lottery numbers? I think they're coordinates, chief. Chief... Come on! Move it! Chief! Great Caesar's ghost. - Daddy. - Oh, my God. How did you get here? I flew. Look out! Mom! Mom! Mom! Jason, come here! Jason! Come here! Watch your head! Come here! Mommy! Mom! Jason! Jason, hold on! - Have you got him? - I got him! Go! Hold on! Hold on! - Mommy! - Give him to me! Mommy! - Mommy! Mommy! - Come on, Jason! Come on! - Lois! Lois! - Mommy! Jason, get on my back. Give me your hand. - Have you got them? - Yeah. Get buckled in! She'll be fine. I can't take off in this. - I'll point you in the right direction. - Thank you. See anything familiar? I see an old man's sick joke. Really? Because I see my new apartment... ...and a place for Kitty, one for my friends... ...and that place over there, I'll rent out. But, you know, maybe you're right. You know, maybe it is a little cold. It's... What's the word I'm searching for? It's a little... ...alien. It lacks that human touch. You have something that belongs to me. Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel. Do you copy? Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel. Do you copy? Damn it! Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel. Do you copy? Lois! Are you all right? Yeah. What happened? - Superman. - Where is he? He went back. - Richard, we have to turn around. - What? No. - We have to turn around! - We barely made it out of there. - Now you want me to go back? - Yes, please! He'll die. All right, hold on. Kryptonite. You're asking yourself, ""How?"" Didn't your dad ever teach you to look before you leap? Crystals. They're amazing, aren't they? They inherit the traits of the minerals around them... ...kind of like a son inheriting the traits of his father! You took away five years of my life, I'm just returning the favor! I'm still Superman! Get up! Come on! Now, fly. So long, Superman. Your leadership can stir others... ... to their own capacities for moral betterment. The human heart is still subject to monstrous deceits. Our destruction could have been avoided. At this very moment... ... I could embrace you in my arms. Your help would be called for endlessly. Remember me. Even for those tasks which human beings could solve themselves. Remember me, Kal-El. Remember me. Superman's down there. - You sure? - Yeah. - Richard! - Yeah, I saw him. Strap in. Lois! Don't move. Come on, come on, come on. Richard! I'm trying! It's too choppy! Oh, my God. How did you find me? Thank you. What are you doing? I have to go back. You're hurt! Goodbye, Lois. The technology on Krypton, Superman's home world... ... was based on manipulating the growth of crystals. Sounds like hocus-pocus to me. Well, naturally, to the primitive mind, any sufficiently advanced technology... ... would be indistinguishable from magic. But imagine: Cities, vehicles, weapons... ... entire continents, all grown. Lex? Are billions of people really going to die? Yes. Lex, what's happening? Go, go, go. Get to the helicopter. Go! Out, out! Now! No, no, no, take nothing! Take nothing! Go, go! Got it. Here. - What did you do? - I'm sorry! No! - What did you do? - I'm sorry! Watch it. - Clear a path. - Clear the way. - Move! - Trauma One. - Where we going? - Trauma One. Here it is. Watch it! Got him! Okay, I think I got it. Penetrating side wound to right part of lower back. No hemorrhage. Shock at 200. Is that enough? He's not human. All right, charge to three, 360. Clear! It's kind of morbid, Perry. Always be prepared. How is she? Thank you. Thanks, baby. - Lois? - Yeah. We can leave whenever you're ready. I mean... ...you don't have to be here. Where else would I be? Police have surrounded the area in order to control thousands of visitors... ... who have arrived to show their support. Many are carrying signs and banners... I could drive. - No official announcements over the past few hours... ... but unconfirmed reports from inside tell us... ... the Man of Steel lies in a coma... ... his condition unchanged since he was admitted late yesterday. - Doctors have been vigilant in their... - Foreign exchange markets... - Where are you going? - To the hospital. I'd be careful down there, guys. It's a madhouse. - So much for parking. - Do you think I can get in? You're Lois Lane. They'll let you in. I wanna go with Mommy. Taxi. I'll be right here. Watch your head, okay? Here we go. This way, Miss Lane. Mommy? Is he gonna get better? - I don't know. - I want him to. I like him. Me too. I don't know if you can hear me. They say sometimes that when people are... That sometimes they can hear you. I don't know if you can hear me. I wanted to tell you... Come on, honey. Step back, please! Lex, we only have six of those! Six? I would trade 300,000 coconuts... ...and every ounce of your blood... ...for a quart of gasoline! But what will we have to eat? You will be different. Sometimes, you will feel like an outcast. But you'll never be alone. You will make my strength your own. You will see my life through your eyes... ...as your life will be seen through mine. The son becomes the father... ...and the father becomes the son. Good night! I... Will we see you? Around? I'm always around. Good night, Lois. Subtitles by SDI Media Group , All units, all units. Code 3 pursuit of 2-11. White SUV heading east on Alameda service road. Suspects: three Asian males. Be advised. Shots fired, shots fired. Cheryl, can you see how many suspects are in this car? As far as I can see at this point, there are three sus... Oh, this is just coming in. Hancock! What, boy? Bad guys. - trying to cut them off. You can see them there. They have their hands outside the white SUV... ... shooting randomly on the freeway. What, you want a cookie? Get out of my face. Asshole. - What? - You heard me. Please, stay off the freeway. I understand that there are three suspects in the white SUV... Asshole. Watch out! Damn! Damn it! Hancock!?! Beat it, 'Soulja Boy! ' Hancock is in the car... ... and he appears to be negotiating with the gunmen. He smells like a bar! You pay for new roof! Fellas, hey. I don't give a shit what you did. I don't care. Three guys in the car, no girls, rave music. Hey, I'm not gonna judge. But if you don't pull over and give yourselves up quietly... ...I swear to Christ, your head is going up the driver's ass. His head is going up your ass. And you drew the short stick... ...because your head is going up my ass. Shoot this asshole! Stop! What the F% #K? The department is on their way. There's just chaos here on the 105. What? I'm not Japanese, man! Put us down! Oh, now you ""speaky Engly,"" huh? ""Speaky Engly"" now? You broke my glasses. I'm sorry! Take my Ray-Bans! - Put us down! - You want down? - Yes, please! Please! - Help me! I'm real good at down. I'm real good at down. All right? All right. This, Hancock's latest act of so-called heroics... ... took a hefty financial toll. Initial damage estimates are said to top $9 million... ... which, if accurate... ... represents a personal record... ... for the notoriously publicity-shy Hancock... ... who, as usual, can't be reached for comment. With all the cracks to the concrete, all the bullets, water damage, fires... ... L.A. would be better off if this guy would leave... ... and let us get on with our jobs. He has never asked me for a badge and has never worked with us... ... in any capacity whatsoever. Zero. Just do it somewhere else. New York, maybe. Let them suffer for a while. What the hell's the crane doing there? Move the... The crane's not gonna help! How are we supposed to get down? I will break my foot off in your ass, woman. This Hancock guy is surely on some kind of mission. And he's using our city to beat himself up for reasons known only to him. We'll have shots later from Chopper 1... ... for the removal of the SUV from the landmark needle. Sir? Ray Embrey. - Ray. - Pleasure. - So... - Ray's like the Bono of P.R. Well, actually I think Bono is the Bono of P.R., but I do try. Well, let's see it. Okay. I'll get right into it. Good morning, everyone. I'm here to talk to you about charitable giving. Okay? And we all know the way that works. You give one, maybe two percent of your net cash... ...and you get an armband, or a ribbon or whatever. It's nowhere near enough. And that's why we at Embrey Publicity would like to offer you... ...the AllHeart symbol. Now, you would be among a very select group of corporate giants... ...to bear this logo on your product. And what this would say to the public... ...is that your company, Pharmatopsis... ...has made a radical contribution to helping our world. Here's all you need to do to qualify. Your new TB drug, Mycodin? We would like for you to give that product away for free. - Did you say ""free""? - I did. Only to those who need it. Only to those who without it would otherwise die. As a concept, free is kind of up there with, you know, lethal side effects. - Mandatory product recall. - Get indicted, go to jail. Get out, work at IHOP for the rest of your career. Understandable reaction. It's a radical concept. But it is the brand that represents a fairer and better world. The brand... ...that everyone is talking about. Who is ""everyone""? We do already have a sports franchise. - NFL? NBA? MLB? - Soccer. MLS? Which team? Well, it's a local team. Encino Hurricanes. It's my son's team. Anyway, we can save the world. All right? Someone's just gotta go first. What do you say? Are you a crackpot? Hey, hon. You're probably at the store. I am on my way. I think I made a connection. Not really. Listen, tell Aaron that I'm coming and I... Damn it. And I want some meatballs, okay? I need some Spaghetti Madness. I'll see you in about 20 minutes. Hey! What is it, National Horn Day? Idiot. Hey. Hey. Hey! Move it. There's a train coming. Do you not hear that horn? Let's go! I got a train! Move it! - Back your car up! There's a train! - I can't go anywhere. Get out! Son of a bitch! Fix the handle, Ray. Fix the handle. Get out! Get off the track! Move! - Let's get him out. - Get him out of there. - Somebody help him. - You all right? Please, that guy's still in there. You sure? Get him out of there! Will you look at that? - Ah, shit. - I'm all right. I'm okay. All of you people... ...blocking the intersection... ...you're all idiots. You threw the dude's car at her. And what's with the train? Why didn't you just go straight up in the air with the car? You've obviously injured that poor woman. - She's right. She should sue you. - Yeah, she should sue you. Well, you should sue McDonald's because they fucked you up. You're an asshole. And I can smell that liquor on your breath. - Because I've been drinking, bitch. - You're a drunk asshole! - You think you're such a hero. - Asshole! - You're nothing but an asshole. - We don't need you in this city. Some superhero you are! Fly off! Shut up! Don't you understand? I'm alive. I get to go home and see my family. I should be dead right now, right here. Yeah, he could've gone straight up. Obviously, you should've. You know, and I was upside down for the train, but... No. Thank you. Thank you very much, Hancock. Thank you. Thank you, Hancock. You're not flying by the Valley, are you? Throw the ball! Monte, one guy'll line up here, all right? Hike the ball. This guy'll be right here and he says, ""Hut!"" This guy'll drop back. Hut! Drop back. Chuck it. Great. Thank you. Nice aim. The driveway would've been better, but... - What's going on, Dad? - Hey, buddy. Daddy's had a little bit of a day. Look at you, huh? I want you to meet somebody. This guy here, dragging Daddy's car into the driveway. - Who's this? - Hancock. That's right. Hancock, this is my boy, Aaron. - Ray, what happened to the car? - Oh, boy. You would not have believed it. I came this close to getting hit by a train. If it wasn't for that guy... He saved my life. I mean... Hancock, this is my wife, Mary. Believe that? I almost kissed a train. Saw my whole life flash before my eyes. - He saved your life? - He sure did. Thank you. - Hey, you good? - I am good, yeah. - All right. Keep it off the tracks. - I will, definitely. Hang on a... One second. - Hancock, you eat, yes? Human food? - Yeah. - You like meatballs? - No. Aaron, sweetheart, he has to go and do... I love meatballs. Who's so busy they can't have a meal? And it's on us. Please. I'm not even gonna take no for an answer. Get inside the house. Why do you have an eagle on your hat? Do you like eagles? This guy's like a little talking machine, huh? We don't have a lot of guests over here. Look at that, huh? Hon, is the heat on? No? All right. We started Spaghetti Madness about two years ago. We do it every Thursday, and we have not missed a Thursday in... - Ever. - Yeah. - Ever? That's a long time. - Yes, sir. - A very long time. - That's some good meatballs, boy. Aaron. - Your mama's calling you. - Yes, Mom? No. His name is Aaron. - Hey, Aaron, how was school today? - Fine. Yeah? No more problems with that bully, Michael? - Michel. But not like a girl's name. - Michel. No, no, I know. - It's French. - Yeah. Michel, Hancock, is this... Hancock? Michel is this neighborhood bully. We've been trying to teach Aaron a little... ...about conflict resolution. You know what I mean? - Yeah. Turn the other cheek, all that? - That's exactly right. Well, just never turn that one, all right? Never let them punk you. - Got it, Mr. Hancock. - Aaron, eat. The way you deal with bullies, you take your right foot... ...bring it right up and catch him in his little piss pump. You don't have to do that, honey, okay? Seriously. It's a good idea. You aim straight and make sure he can't use that thing... ...for nothing but a flap to keep the dust out of his butt crack. Okay, please, just stop. Michel is not a man, okay? He's a little boy. And his parents... ...happen to be going through a bad divorce. That's why he's acting up. Maybe you don't know this... ...but not everything in this world gets resolved with force. - Not everything has to be bang... - I'm set. ...scream, blood, more blood. - Baby, I got plenty. Angel! We're okay. She watches so much news... ...that sometimes it gets to be a little too much. - You got a toilet? - Yep. Yeah, just past the fridge. Are...? Did he just take the whiskey bottle to the bathroom? Do you want him to kill us all? Thanks for coming on in. Good, right? - Very, yeah. - Wanna say goodbye to him? - Bye, Hancock. - Hey, all right, little buddy. - Are you okay? - It was a joke. - Come on, Aaron. - Hey, sorry. I was just trying to... He got it. She didn't get it. I owe you. You gave me my life back today. Hear me out. I'd like to return the favor. Do you know what I do? I'm in public relations. You know what that is? Of course you do. We're image consultants. We change the way people see products, companies, people, that stuff. Listen, I see you on the news and I see you out there today... ...and it can't feel good that people, you know, hate you. - It's good to meet you, Ray. - No, I'm sorry. But hear me out. People... Don't get me wrong, they should love you. They really should. I wanna deliver that for you. It's the least that I can do. You know, you're a superhero. Kids should ask you for your autograph. People should cheer you on the streets. What the hell are you pricks looking at? No, no, they're not... It's all right. They're not pricks, they're just people. But I want you to give me one short pitch, you know? That's all I ask. Okay? You use... Put it under here? Put it right there. Perfect. E-mail me or whatever. You just fly on over, I don't know. I want you to think about it. Just be careful when you go. Sleep on it, all right? You get back to me? I'll be right here. All right. Please don't stare, you guys. He's kind of one of us. What about AllHeart? It's a nonstarter, babe, you know? I'm chasing windmills with that. Maybe I can't change the world but I can change this guy's life. - Think about all the good he can do. - I think you're wasting your time. You really hate him. Hate? I don't hate him, Ray. I don't even know the guy. Just look at the news. You can see what he does. I think he just needs people to care, you know? You see the good in everybody, Ray. Even sometimes when it's not there. I have a feeling about this. Don't work with this guy. I know this kind of guy. He breaks things. My bad. Everybody all right? I'll go and get my mommy. He is an asshole. - What's your name, boy? - Michel. Do you know Aaron? Well, seems to be a pretty good kid. Just wanna ask you to lay off of him a little bit. Why, asshole? - You're gonna stop calling me that. - Asshole. - That's not my name. - Asshole. Call me a asshole... ...one more time. Asshole. How about you, thickness? Goggles? Hancock! You son of a gun, I knew you'd come. Ask Mary. I had a feeling. I said, he heard me and he's ready for a change. This is great. Did you do this? You come in a little hot? I'll meet you in the house. - I know you don't drive, but... - Oh, damn it, Ray. All right. You're all right. You're all right. You're all right. Oh, stop crying, punk-ass. Go ahead. - Not okay. Okay? - He all right. Really not okay. This is some of the stuff we're gonna work on. How do you think that conversation's gonna go down with his mom? Landing like that in the street's also on the uncool side. No, that was already like that when I got here, Ray. I live here. I know what the street's like. We'll make those problems of the past. I'm gonna teach you how to interface with the public. - Where's the wife? - Mary took Aaron to his soccer game. Hancock, pulled some stuff up on YouTube. Surprisingly large amount of not-great stuff on you that's gonna be helpful. What is this? That's me trying to change the world. Unfortunately, not doing real well. Come on. Let's get to you. This stuff was on YouTube. Everybody loves a Nutty Buddy, I get it, but this doesn't work, sir. Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy. Back up, back up. Mom! Mom! Mom! Those are children. - We've been waiting a long time... - Get that camera out of my face. You ever put out an apartment fire, Ray? - No, I haven't done that. I'm in P.R. - No. My ass was hot. All right. How about this? This is Walter, the gray whale. Everybody remembers him stuck on the beach north of Zuma. Along comes Hancock. Hancock! - I don't even remember that. - Yeah. Greenpeace does. Walter does. This gets redundant after a while... ...but my basic diagnosis of your fundamental problem is... - Do you wanna hear it? - No. You're an asshole. I know. I call it like I see it though. It's not a crime to be an asshole but it's counterproductive. But you are an asshole, don't you think? Be careful. All right, how about this? I've been thinking about something. This kind of goes to how you present yourself. Come on. Really? It's the middle of the day. What springs to mind... ...when you see this? Homo. - What about that? - Homo in red. - Norwegian homo. - I'll give you that. Let's move past the comics. Let's get into something a little deeper. I think that deep down you behave badly because you're lonely. I think deep down, you want people's acceptance. Come on, now. You save people's lives... ...and they reject you, and so you reject them back. And it's a... And we're gonna switch that cycle. We're gonna start fresh, start anew. This is outstanding. If you turn some of this power into willpower... - Almost. - And then he kicked it in. Hey, Hancock! We almost won. Yeah, we did. Okay, upstairs. I'm making lunch. Go change. Hey, sweetheart. Have you been watching the news? - No, we've been working on... - Interfacing with the public. - This has been on all day. - That's very good. The law is the law, Mr. Hancock, and you are not above it. Felony destruction of property... ... amounting to tens of millions of dollars, theft, and now this. From where I sit, I see a selfish, self-absorbed man... ... with a lot of muscle, but no regard for anyone but yourself. Mr. Hancock, let me remind you. You are not above the law. You have failed to show at over 600 subpoenas in civil suits. Anybody else would be held in contempt. But, oh, no. Not you. You may be a superhero, but let me tell you this: You're not nearly as strong as the U.S. Constitution. Bank on it, buddy. We do not condone the t... Genius. Things just got real. This is exactly what we need. There's a DA trying to figure out how to put you in jail. - Bitch can try. - I say you go. People take you for granted. Make people miss you. - People don't like you, Hancock. - I do. Two weeks, you know? The public will be clamoring for you. When they do, we'll be ready. Worst-case scenario is I'm wrong and you just, you know, fly out of there. What do you got to lose? ""I apologize to the people of Los Angeles. My behavior has been improper and I accept the consequences. I ask my fellow Angelenos... ... for their patience and understanding. "" You're an asshole, Hancock! Asshole! ""Life here can be difficult for me. After all, I'm the only one of my kind. During my incarceration, I will be participating... ... in alcohol- and anger-management treatment. "" You're a drunk bum! ""You deserve better from me. I can be better. I will be better."" All right. Give me the hand, playboy. I see you, punk! Oh, I get it. I put some... Most of you in here. Yes, you did. I can understand you feeling some kind of way about that. What? So I'm gonna do me, and I'm gonna let you do you. I don't want no trouble. All right? I just wanna go to my cell. - That ain't gonna happen. - Nope. Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Deadly. If you don't move, your head is going up his ass. Y'all fellas sure you wanna ride this train? Choo, choo, asshole. Get him out! Get him out! Did you shove a man's head up another man's ass? We're gonna... We're gonna circle back to that. The DA's office wants your sentence to run eight years. It's a big number, but not something we didn't anticipate. You know, our plan is... What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey! It sounded like you said they want me to spend eight years in this shithole. Eight is more like four and a half with good behavior. But it's irrelevant because with you out of the picture... ...and with the crime rate going up through the roof... ...the DA and the cops, they're all gonna call for your immediate release. They're gonna demand it. Where are you going? Sit down. Hey. Hey. Stop right there. - Stop it. Hancock. - Move. - Hancock! - Get back! You're being a coward! - Who you talking to? - I'm talking to you. - Who are you talking to, Ray? - Stop pretending that you do not care. You have a calling. You're a hero, Hancock. You're gonna be miserable the rest of your life until you accept that. Trust me. Trust this plan, this process. Just stay in here. When they call, a hero's what we're gonna give them. How we gonna do that, Ray? All right, guys, let's start sharing. - Don? You had something? - Yeah. Yeah, I think I might've had a little bit of a breakthrough. Good for you. Yeah, I mean, I realized that breaking necks is... It's easy. But I'm sitting there and I'm staring at myself in the mirror... ...and I thought, ""This is tough."" - Yeah, it sounds tough. Why do you always laugh? Picturing you looking at the mirror. It would scare the shit out of me. Every time I'm talking, he completely ruins the cycle. Now, let's watch the crosstalk. I'm not gonna share anymore if he keeps doing that. No, no, no. - Keep sharing. - Let's move on. Mr. Hancock, do you wanna share today? Pass. Your landing is your first impression. It's your superhero handshake. Don't come in too hot, okay? Don't come in too boozy. And don't land on a $ 100,000 Mercedes. All right? People have to be happy that you've arrived. Mr. Hancock, your share. Pass. So you've used the door and the building's still intact. People are happy that you've arrived. They feel safe. There's an officer and he's done a good job... ...so tell him he's done a good job. What the hell did I have to come for if he's done a good job? Oh, man! KBLA radio, AM 850. Today's big story, no surprise here: Hancock. What's your take? I, for one, have had enough of this guy. I'm glad he's doing time around bars and I hope they don't let him off easy. Let my cousin Pookie out. ""I see you don't wear a bulletproof vest, security officer. I respect your courage... ...because bullets don't bounce off you, they bounce off me."" This city is being run by gangs and drug dealers. Hancock makes them shake in their boots. He doesn't tie a pretty ribbon around it, but he gets the job done. Besides, he's hot. Let me hear you say it. Let me hear you say, ""Good job."" G... Goo... Mr. Hancock, would you like to share? - Pass. - Good. Good. Good j... Good j... Good job. Good job. Jail watch, day five, and true to his word, Hancock remains incarcerated. Meanwhile, crime is still on the rise. The L.A.P.D. is reporting increases of up to 30 percent... ... in the last five days that Hancock has been behind bars. - Hancock! Hey, Hancock! - Hey, little buddy. - Hancock. We brought you something! - Hey, hey. Hey, what's up, Hancock? Where's...? Where's Ray? No, it's just us. Ray's working. Aaron really wanted to come and see you... ...so we just dropped by with some Spaghetti Madness. I should probably let the guard check for keys... - No, no. Here. - Okay. Here you go. Oh, you brought me meatballs, huh? - Just dig in. - Oh, man, look at that. Look at that. - That's a good meatball. - Thanks, Hancock. Ray is a good man. Whatever this is you're doing, don't let him down. Okay? Okay. Well, we should probably go, buddy. - Already? I wanna stay with Hancock. - Yeah. Sweetheart... ...we have to go. Come on, say goodbye to Hancock. Here, Hancock. It's my favorite one, and I want you to have it. - That was very sweet. - Thanks, Mom. Come here. Mr. Hancock, would you like to share? Pass. All right. Phillip? I love you guys, man. - We love you. - We love you too, Phillip. For when they call. - I ain't wearing that, Ray. - Yes, you are. - Oh, no, I'm not. - No, you are. Actually, I'm not, Ray. You think you're not, but you are. I will fight crime butt-ass naked before I fight it in that, Ray. You know, you have fought naked. We've got that. That's on YouTube. Hancock, this is a uniform. A uniform represents purpose. Doctors, policemen, firemen, right? - It represents a calling. - It's been two weeks. - Yeah? - Nobody out there is missing me, Ray. Just be patient. You gotta trust me on this. All right? Perimeter breach, perimeter breach. Asshole! You're still a fake-ass punk. Damn! Mr. Hancock? It's your share. Pass. - Come on, man, try it. Let it out. - Come on, John. I don't have nothing. There's nothing on your mind? Come on, John. - It's cool, man. - Come on. - Come on. - Do it. First time for everything. - Feels good to release, now. - Let it heal. Come on, man, try it. Come in here all these days, you don't have anything to share? I'm Hancock, and I drink and stuff. All right. Thanks for sharing. - Okay. - Thank you. - All right. - That's awesome. - That's a clap. Yeah. - There you go. Good share. Hey, Hancock. Come on, get up. - You got a phone call. - Take a message. It's the chief of police. He says he needs your help. The trapped officer's husband is Corporal Joseph Blake... ...who was killed last year in Iraq... ... leaving her two small children. We are waiting for the latest news... ... but apparently there are three suspects and... What's going on? I'm out! Stay down! Stay down! Stay down! - Get out! - Get down! Get it down! Let's go! Everybody's gotta get back! Let's go! Back! Move! We got perimeters set up on the north, east and south sides. The west side is open. Don't break the building, don't break the building. What? It's a little tight. What you got? Bank job. I got at least eight hostages. Four bad guys. Officer pinned down. We can't get to her. They been spraying the hell out of us all morning. And... They got some kind of heavy artillery. Fifty caliber or bigger. - I don't know if that matters to you. - No, I'm good. Good job. Good job. Really, good job. Get down! It's Hancock! Take him out! Good job! Do I have permission to touch your body? Yes! It's not sexual. Not that you're not an attractive woman. - You're a very attractive woman... - Get me the hell out of here! He's on the move! He's moving, he's moving! Good job. - Are you hit anywhere? - My leg! - Hancock! - Good job. You said that. I need you to end this now. Check the flanks. Secure the perimeter. Spread out! They're gonna come around the back. What happened to him? Where'd he go? Where'd he go? What is happening? - I heard you was in the slammer. - Out early. - Why's that? - Good behavior. Do you know what this is? I'm guessing it's some kind of detonator-type deal. There's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped to each and every one of them. This is a spring-loaded dead man's switch. If my thumb comes off it: And now, since we've had a little change of plan... ...between the police showing up and you sucking out all of my associates... ...I want you to break into the vault. You'll find three quarter-ton pallets of small bills inside. Thirty million dollars. And you're gonna carry it for me. You are gonna get me safely away from here with the money... ...or else they'll be cleaning up these hostages with a mop. I'm gonna have to say no to that. I'm really trying to turn over a new leaf. I will blow up this entire building, you asshole. I really don't like that word. I will blow them sky-high... ...and their blood will be on your hands. Do you hear me, asshole? Call me a asshole... ...one more time. Ass... Keep your hand on that trigger. - Good job. - No. You, good job. - Thank you. - Good job. Hancock! Say hi to your fans. Look what you got. Here we go. This way. - Hancock. At the bank today, intense. - Thank you. Smile. Good job, Hancock! Hey. Boy, they'll let anybody in here, huh? Hancock, meet these guys. This is Mike Kilbourne and Jeremy Himmel. Gigantic fans. Insane! These guys are partners at the biggest ad firm. You never call, man. - I have called. A couple of times. - Water under the bridge, man. Could you guys get used to this or what? How'd you two meet? I was married once before. First wife... ...she died giving birth to Aaron. It's another dinner. But... But... So there I am, I'm with this beautiful little baby. I don't know what the hell to do. And I was in the supermarket... ...and I'm in the baby aisle... ...and I've got a brand of diapers in each hand. I'm staring at them, but I don't know how I'm gonna get through the day. An angel... ...sees me. She knew. She was... She gave me this look. And even in the trance I was in, I knew that somebody somewhere... ...was throwing me a little rope. You know? Starting that day, you really put my life back together. Right? - You're drunk. - So? Come here. What about you, buddy? You're from another planet, aren't you? No, man, I'm from Miami. You didn't come in on, like, a meteor or...? Nope. Woke up in a hospital, first thing I remember. Government hospital, yes? Experimenting on you and... No, Ray. Regular old Miami emergency room. - Come on. - My skull was fractured. They told me I tried to stop a mugging. - Somebody knocked you out. - I guess I was a regular guy before... ...and when I woke up, I was changed. The hospital nurse tried to put a needle in my arm... ...and it just broke against my skin. And then my skull healed in, like, an hour. The doctors were astounded... ...and they wanted to know my story. Just like you. But I couldn't tell them. I don't know who I am. Amnesia. - You know, the blow to the head. - Yeah, well, that's what they figured. - You don't remember anything? - No. Only thing I had in my pocket was... ...bubble gum... ...two movie tickets. Boris Karloff, Frankenstein. But no ID, nothing. I went to sign out, the nurse asked me for my John Hancock. I actually thought that's who I was. How come I didn't hear any of this, didn't read about it in any newspapers? It was probably in the papers 80 years ago. Eighty years ago? Oh, I don't age. This is it. - That's nice. - Gotta wonder, though: What kind of bastard must I have been... ...that nobody was there to claim me? I mean, I'm not the most charming guy in the world... ...so I've been told, but... ...nobody? That didn't tire you out, coming up the stairs? - Not really. - I'm real spinny. Could've just flown me upstairs. - I could've done without that. - Get your shoes off here. All right, that's all you're getting off of me though. You believe in me, don't you, Hancock? - Of course, Ray. I believe in you. - Help me up here. Listen. This is important because I believe in you, you know, and... You're gonna do great. You're gonna fix everything. - You get some sleep, Ray. - You sleep tight too. Hancock tucking me in. All right, he's asleep. The damn babysitter never cleans up after herself. You have a bruise on your hand. You... You should go. Getting late. If Ray finds out about me... ...you're dead. Joan, we're gonna take care of that, okay? Don't you worry. Hi, honey. Breakfast? Hancock sneezed, huh? Can you believe it? It's amazing that you slept through that. - You're a good sleeper. - Holy shit. I'm not gonna say I told you so, but... You told me he was gonna sneeze a hole through the house? I just said him being around... Oh, sweetheart, can you get that? Thanks. - Oh, God, you strong man. - I got it. But you don't worry about anything. I already apologized to the neighbors. Called State Farm. Everything is taken care of. You just... ...enjoy that breakfast. What's this? Are we going on vacation? Are we? Just the three of us. - End of the summer? - Tonight. - Tonight? - Let's go somewhere. Knock, knock. Gesundheit. I was just telling Ray here, I hope you're done sneezing... ...because I don't think our house could take much more... ...of your sneezing. Yeah, sometimes I sneeze when there's dust... ...or if I get really surprised. That's unfortunate. This is Kilbourne. Mike? How you doing? It was great to see you too. Yep. Well... Right. Go ahead, shoot. Okay. I got a pen right here. Right. No, I know. It's right here in my hand. I am warning you. All right, go ahead. Okay, good. Now... And that's still in 310, right? Hang on one second. Do me a favor? I'm sorry, Mike. Yeah. We're gonna talk. Go away. Well, it is something that I'm really excited about. - I'm gonna do this all day. - Shut... Shut up. I... I suppose... - Fine. We'll talk, okay? - We will. And when we're done talking, you go away and you leave my family alone. - My place at 4:00. - Whatever. It means... Well, I'd rather not talk numbers now. I'd like to save them for the pitch. So let's just set a time. That's good with me. I will see you then. All right. Yeah, 3:30. Great. Hon, is it hot in here? He hurt you, didn't he? Come on, use your words. How did it make you feel? Sore. Bad. Bad. It's because he took your power. And you have to get your power back. And no one will give you your power back. You have to go out and take it. You understand me? We're gonna go find Hancock... ...and get your power back. Ask. - You and I. - ""You and I"" what? - We're the same. - No. I'm stronger. Really? Oh, yeah. Who are we? Gods, angels. Different cultures call us by different names. Now all of a sudden, it's ""superhero."" - Are there more of us? - There were. They all died. It's just the two of us. What is this? Who are we to each other? - We're brother and sister. - That's a lie. - No, I'm your sister. - That is a lie. - I'm your sister. - That is a lie. Sisters don't kiss brothers the way you kissed me last night. You're lying, deal's off. Let's go see how Ray feels about this. Get your ass back here! I'm telling! The AllHeart symbol will be known globally... ...as a symbol... ...that represents companies that are committed to changing the world. They can give away their sustenance goods, okay? Food, drugs, power, clothing, for free. - We were talking about Hancock... - Number two. You stay away from me and my family. You are not gonna do this to me again. What? I don't know what you're talking about. - Hey! - I love you, Hancock! It can't work. It always ends the same way. Persia. Greece. Brooklyn. Brooklyn? I've never been to Brooklyn. I have put up with your bullshit for 3000 years... ...and I am done! Done, you listening? - I don't know what you're talking about! - Finally, I am happy! - You are not gonna mess with that! - I don't know what you're talking about! I hate to burst your little crazy-lady bubble... ...but it must not have been all that great because I don't remember you. Call me crazy... ...one more time. Cuckoo. All right, hold it. All right. You better not hit me with that truck. For companies to qualify, they need to prove they are a leader in the global... We wanna talk about Mr. Hancock. They're committed to bettering the world. They can do this in four ways. This is how they... The most important thing with AllHeart is brand recognition. I've mocked up these examples here... ...in Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris. Oh, no. We need maximum exposure, market penetra... Is it snowing? Get off! - Get off me! - Listen to me! - I hate you! - I am sorry! Whoever I am, whatever I did... Look at me. I'm sorry. Why were you flying? You were flying, Mary. - Yeah, she was definitely flying, Ray. - Okay, I was flying. And I'm very strong as well. - It's just the way we are. - ""We""? Me and him, it's just us now. The others paired up and died. You didn't say anything about pairing up at the trailer. - You were at his trailer. - This is hard to explain. - Great, I'm all ears. - Me too. Do me a favor, just give me and my wife one moment. - Don't bring it here, Ray. - The adults are talking. Technically speaking... ...he's my husband. Holy shit. - What? - We broke up decades ago. Long before you were born. He just can't remember. But you can, right? You knew? That's something you bring up on a first date, Mary. ""I don't like to travel. I'm allergic to cats. I'm immortal."" Those are some things you give a heads-up on. Whatever we are, we were built in twos, okay? We're drawn to each other. No matter how far I run, he's always there. He finds me. It's physics. Are you saying that you two are fated to be together? I've lived for a very long time, Ray. And the one thing I learned... ...fate doesn't decide everything. People get to choose. And you chose... ...to let me think I was here alone. I didn't think you'd miss what you didn't remember. Great. Now what? I didn't plan for this. Prison authorities confirmed... ... that the prisoner uprising was led by Kenneth ""Red"" Parker, Jr... ... who was also the leader of last week's Spring Street bank robbery. At least eight prisoners are not accounted for. More information on the prison riot in Norwalk. Construction workers at the prison were knocked unconscious. The prisoners stole the workers' clothes... ... and it's feared at least some of them have escaped. Parker is considered a criminal mastermind. He is very effective at using psychological persuasion... ... to organize criminals from different backgrounds. He is a former psychology professor from Stanford University. While there, he organized a notorious criminal network... ... comprised of graduate students from diverse... Ninety-one ten. Ninety-one ten? You gotta be shitting me. Ninety-one ten. Highway robbery. - What? - I'm taking the money. I can relate to that. You know? If you want something... ...nobody can stop you from taking it... ...you just take it, right? I like that. But can you take it? My Zagnut bar versus your gun. Sorry about your window. - I need Room 1020. - Clear! I need Room 1020. I need IV line, blood quality, CBC, electrolytes, a PT, and... Where's his IV line? - That's not gonna work. - I'm in. What's happening? This just in. John Hancock has been rushed... ... to Los Angeles General Hospital. Hancock is in serious condition with multiple gunshot wounds. No story yet as to how this happened to him... ... but we will continue to cover this story live. Reporting live from L. A... - Any lead on the assailant? - Mr. Embrey! - Just a couple of questions, sir, please. - Can you describe how it happened? From what I've heard, he was trying to stop a robbery. Do you know if special ammunition was used in the gun that shot him? Not that I'm aware of. Could this have to do with the mysterious woman? - He was seen battling her. - I do not have that answer. Could this woman be more powerful than Hancock? Here are the lab results for 209. You're becoming mortal. It's us... ...being close to each other. It's never happened this fast before. You have to leave. The further you get from me, the better you're gonna feel. You'll start getting your powers back... ...and be flying and breaking things... ...and saving people before you know it. Well, it's like I said, we were built in pairs. And when we get close to our opposites, we lose our power. - Why? - So we can live human lives. Love, connect... ...grow old, die. What happened to us? Summer of 4 B.C. We were becoming mortal, like now. They came after me with swords. But you saved me. They set our house on fire. You pulled me out of the flames. Eighty years ago. What happened then? We were living in Miami... ...and a new movie was playing in town. Frankenstein. And after... ...we walked down Flagler Street... ...and you took my hand, and you held it so tight. And they attacked us in an alley. They hit you so hard. There was so much blood. They wouldn't let me ride in the ambulance with you. And by the time I got to the hospital, you were awake. But you didn't know me. So I left. Every time we're together... ...they come after you through me. You're built to save people more than the rest of us. That's who you are. You're a hero. The insurance policy of the gods. Keep one alive. You. To protect this world. Mary! Mom! - Mary! - Stay down! Okay. Mary? Stop. Oh, no! No! Please! Stay down. Hey! Mary! Let's go, get her up! Come on, Chuck. Let's go, let's go. - Morphine. - Here. Help in here! Hold her down. Hold her down. Hold her down. Hold her down. - You want the monitor now? - Stay calm. - Hold her, hold her, hold her. - Need EKG leads. Upon us all, Hancock. You're no different. Time to shut her down, Hancock. It's been a nice run. Oh, we are all sincerely gonna miss you. But it is time for you to move on. And maybe to a happier place. You can thank me if you want to... ...superhero. You didn't! Aaron! - What about Attila the Hun? - Completely cross-eyed. - Cross-eyed? - Yep. All right, what about Queen Elizabeth? - Needy. - J.F. K? What about him? Oh, yeah. ""Oh, yeah""? Anything more? Not like that. I was in Cuba for the whole missile thing. Yeah, hang on. - Hello? - Ray. Hey, I've been trying to call you. Yeah, I was out of cell range. - Are you outside? - Yeah. - Look up. - All right, I'm looking up. I'm looking up. - Baby? - What? You're gonna change the world. - Good job, Ray. - Oh, my God, Ray. Hey. Look up. Hancock. I'm proud of you. Thanks. Will I get in trouble for that? - Freeze! - Don't move! - Oh, my God! Sam! No! - Drop your weapon, sir! Get back! Get back! Get back! - Drop it! - Get back or I'll shoot! Get back! Get back! I'm not playing. Get back. Get back! Damn, Handjob. Where you come from? All right, relax. Just tell me what you need. Tell them cops to take their guns off of me. - All right. - Tell them to take the guns off me. Just take them off. Lower your weapons. You're gonna get us out of here with that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on. Now let's make it happen, asshole. Subtitles by LeapinLar, MAN: They say Japan was made by a sword. They say the old gods dipped a coral blade into the ocean... and when they pulled it out, four perfect drops fell back into the sea... and those drops became the islands of Japan. I say Japan was made by a handful of brave men... warriors willing to give their lives... for what seems to have become a forgotten word: Honor.   MAN: Ladies and gentlemen: Winchester. America's leader in all forms of armament used... by the United States Army... celebrates our nation's centennial by bringing you a true American hero. One of the most decorated warriors this country has ever known. Winner of the Medal of Honor for his gallantry... on the hallowed ground of Gettysburg. San Francisco, 1876 He is late of the 7th Cavalry... and their triumphant campaign against the most savage of the Indian nations. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: Captain Nathan Algren! Captain Nathan Algren! Yes! Ladies and gent... One moment, ladies and gentlemen. Goddamn you, Algren, get out there! This is your last performance! You're fired! Now get out there! Come on! I'm sick of this! Come on! Yes!   My thanks, Mr. McCabe, you are too kind. This, ladies and gents... is the gun that's winning the West. Why, many's the time I've found myself...  Surrounded by a swarm of... angry hostiles, with nothing but this rifle...  Between me and a certain and gruesome death. And let me tell you, folks, the red man... is a fearsome enemy. And if he'd had his way... why, this scalp of mine would be long gone... and there'd be a balder man standing before you today. Like those poor bastards out there... on the Little Bighorn. Bodies stripped bare... mutilated. Left to rot in the sun. This, ladies and gentlemen, the 73 lever-action... Trapper. It's got a seven-shot capacity. Accurate 400 yards, one round per second. Son, have you ever seen what this could do to a man? Blow a hole in your daddy six inches wide. WOMAN: Oh. That's terrible. - That's right, missy. This beauty. You could kill yourself five, six, seven braves without ever having to reload. Note the patented loading port and the smooth cocking action.    My thanks on behalf of those who died... in the name of better mechanical amusements and... commercial opportunities. Mr. McCabe here will take your orders. God bless you all. I must say, captain, you have a flair for the old melodrama. - You're alive. - I am, indeed. Your man Custer says to me, ""We're going to the Little Bighorn."" Says I, ""What's this 'we' stuff?"" It's the walking ticket for me. Nine lives I have. But I'll tell you what else I have. I have a good job for the both of us. God knows it looks as if you'll need one real soon. What kind of a job? The only job you're fit for, boyo. A man's job. Unless, of course, you got your heart set on a career in the theater. Nathan! Just listen to what your man has to say. Been a while. It's good to see you. I'd like you to meet Mr. Omura from Japan... and his associate, whose name I've given up trying to pronounce. Sit down, please. ALGREN: Whiskey. Now, Japan's got it in mind to become a civilized country. And Mr. Omura here is willing to spend what it takes... to hire white experts to train their army. And if we play our cards right... the Emperor grants the U.S. exclusive rights to supply arms. Well, I have an agreement with Winchester Company. I'm certain Mr. Omura has some concept of what an agreement is. Your performances for the Winchester Company bring you $25 a week. We will pay you $400 a month. Five. For each. And another 500 when we get the job done. How many other genuine heroes you got lined up?  He's rude. That's how it is here. A land of cheap traders.  Whiskey. So who will we be training your boys to fight? His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu. He was once the Emperor's teacher. - He's Samurai. - Samurai? The word you might use is ""warrior."" Mr. Omura is familiar with our experiences dealing with renegades. Is he? He's even read your book. Captain Algren's study of the tribes... was a crucial factor in our defeat of the Cheyenne. Please excuse. What is funny? The corps back together again. It's just so... inspiring! Excuse me. I need to use the necessities.  This isn't a problem. I'll just talk to him for a minute. Colonel Bagley. We contacted you because you are Captain Algren's superior officer... and you assured us of his participation. He'll do it. I just need a minute. Nathan. I did what I was ordered to do out there. And I have no remorse. So, what do you say we put the past behind us? You want me to kill Jappos, I'll kill Jappos. - I'm not asking you to kill anybody. - You want me to kill their enemies... I'll kill their enemies. Rebs or Sioux or Cheyenne... For 500 bucks a month, I'll kill whoever you want. But keep one thing in mind... I'd happily kill you for free. ALGREN: July 12th, 1876. There is some comfort in the emptiness of the sea. No past, no future. And then at once, I am confronted by the hard truth of present circumstances. I have been hired to help suppress the rebellion of yet another tribal leader. Apparently, this is the only job for which I am suited. I am beset by the ironies of my life.  Yokohama Harbor, 1876  - Uh, Captain Algren, I presume? - Yes. Jolly good. How do you do? Simon Graham. Twenty years ago, this was a sleepy little town. Now look at it. You see, the Emperor is mad for all things Western... and the Samurai believe it's changing too fast. The ancient and the modern are at war for the soul of Japan. So your new employer, Mr. Omura, is bringing in... every Western expert he can get. Lawyers from France, engineers from Germany, architects from Holland... and now, of course, warriors from America. I came over with the British trade mission, oh, years ago. I was soon relieved of my position. I had an unfortunate tendency to tell the truth... in a country where no one ever says what they mean. So now, I very accurately translate other people's lies. For 2000 years, no emperor was even seen by a commoner. You have to realize what an honor this is. It's all highly ritualized, of course. You may look at him, but do not speak unless spoken to. If he stands, you must bow. If he bows, you must bow lower. Do I look presentable? I haven't worn this in a decade. Rather snug around the midriff. And bow. The divine Emperor Meiji bids you welcome. He is grateful for the assistance your country offers. We hope to accomplish the same national harmony... you enjoy in your homeland.   The Emperor is most interested in your American Indians... if you have fought against them in battle. We have, Your Highness. The red man is a brutal adversary.   The Emperor wishes to ask Captain Algren... if it is true they wear eagle feathers... and paint their faces before going into battle... and that they have no fear. They are very brave.   Bow. Thank you very much. GRAHAM: And step back. Step back, step back and turn. Right, you little bastards! You will stand up straight or I will personally shit-kick... every Far Eastern buttock that appears before my eyes!  Well done, sergeant. When you understand the language, everything falls into place. The first rank will kneel, rifles at the ready.   The second rank... ALGREN: July 22nd, 1876. For six months' work, I am to receive three years of captain's pay... teaching Orientals to soldier. They are an army of conscripts. Most of them are peasants who have never even seen a gun. Fire! They are led by General Hasegawa a man of small stature... who nonetheless commands enormous respect. What can the general tell me about this man, this Samurai, Katsumoto?  ALGREN: He seems to have great knowledge of Katsumoto and his rebellion. I will count on his help when facing the Samurai. Who supplies their weapons?   Katsumoto no longer dishonors himself... by using firearms, you see. He uses no firearms? To those who honor the old ways, Katsumoto is a hero. How well does he know him? The general and Katsumoto fought together for the Emperor. He fought with the Samurai? He is Samurai. GRAHAM: You must understand. Katsumoto pledged his sword... to defend the Emperor. They say that a Samurai's sword is his soul. They're paradoxical people, Samurai. I've tried to write about them, but they keep to themselves. The bastards are still wearing armor. When the Irish were comporting themselves in loincloths... these chaps were the most sophisticated warriors on Earth. I need information on their battle tactics. I have several more books just waiting to be translated. He'll be speaking the lingo in no time. You should hear him blather on in Blackfoot. Really? A fellow linguist? Oh, capital! Come on, sir. A word or two in the savage tongue. Just ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" or... No, no, no! ""Cut his tongue out and boil him in oil."" Early day tomorrow, captain, darling. - It's about bedtime, isn't it? - I always had a fascination with scalping. I never quite understood its technique. Imagine someone who hates you with the utmost intensity... grabbing a handful of your hair while you're lying prostrate and helpless... Ooh. And scraping a dull blade of a rusty knife around your scalp... with a saw-like motion. And let your imagination grasp, if you can, the effect of a strong, quick jerk... on the turf of your hair to release any clinging particles... would have on your nervous system.  And you'll have some idea of how it feels to be scalped... Mr. Graham. Mm.  How soon can you translate those books? Right away. I'm just delighted you're taking such an interest in Samurai. I don't give a damn about the Samurai. I want to know my enemy. GRAHAM: I shall not sleep until it is done. Ah. Sake. I bid you good night. GANT: Can I get you anything, sir? BAGLEY: This is a punitive expedition, captain. Col. Bagley, these people had nothing to do with the raids! GANT: Good night. BAGLEY: Quietly now, boys.   Fire!     We should be grateful they're all firing in the same direction. Couldn't have put it better myself, sir. Rifle butt, against the shoulder.   Eye, down the sight. Now, slowly...   Well done.   Nathan! Katsumoto's attacked a rail road at the border of his province. We cannot govern a country in which we cannot travel freely. He must be stopped now. My rail road is a priority for this country. They're not ready. The rebels don't have any rifles. They're savages with bows and arrows. Whose sole occupation for the last thousand years has been war. You have superior firepower and a larger force. I am ordering the regiment to move against Katsumoto. You will track him down and engage him. Load. Mr. Graham! Tell this man to fire at me! - I beg your pardon? - Tell this man... if he does not shoot me, I will kill him! - Captain, if I might have a word. ALGREN: Tell him! Tell him!   Load! Load! Faster! Faster! Shoot me, damn it. Fire! Fire!  They're not ready. The regiment leaves at 6 a.m.! A thousand miles of rail track laid in less than two years. It's astonishing. And Omura owns all of it? As soon as he can get rid of the Samurai, he will, yes. How do you intend to find Katsumoto? ALGREN: Don't worry, Mr. Graham. I assure you, he'll find us. ALGREN: Move into position! Yoshino Province, 1876 1st Company, form a battle line on me! Pay attention, it will save your life! 2nd Company, form on 1st Company. 3rd and 4th Company, form up behind. Fill in on command! - Where's Hasegawa? - He refuses to fight against Katsumoto. ALGREN: Cover down! - Captain Algren. We are not here as combatants. - Then who's gonna lead them? - Their own officers. - Let's move to the rear. - We'll be there presently. - Fix bayonets! - Fix bayonets!   Mr. Graham, accompany me to the rear. Yes, of course. Sergeant Gant, report to the rear and see to the disposition of the supply trains. - Did you hear my order? - I did indeed, sir! Then you will obey it. Now! No disrespect intended, sir, but shove it up your ass.  - Load! - Load!  Samurai come. You'll be fine, son.  - Assume firing positions! - Assume firing positions!   Fire on my order only! Hold your fire! Hold your fire!  Reload!   Hold the line! Fire at will!   Lieutenant, fall back! Zeb!    He's mine. S'tOp! Take him away!    What is your name?  insolent swine! Answer! Leave him be.  This is my son's village. We are deep in the mountains and winter is coming. You cannot escape. Jolly good.    My Lord, why do you spare the barbarian? He is shamed in defeat. He should kill himself. That is not their custom. Then... I Will kill him. Father, I don't think... Ujio... there will be plenty of killing to come. For now... we will learn about our new enemy. Keep him alive. He's in bad shape. Sake. Sake? Sake. Sake. Taka will take care of you. Sake.   Sake. Sake! Let him drink, Aunt. No. That will not do. This is my village. This is my house.  Please. Sake.  Sake! No! No! I told you! No!    Morning.     Over there!  Go. You, go. What's your name? You got a name, don't you?   You don't know what I'm saying, do you? I know why you don't talk. You're angry. You're angry because they make you wear a dress. Son of a bitch.   This temple was built by my family a thousand years ago. My name is Katsumoto. What is your name? Are my words not correct? I will practice my English with you... if you would honor me. You kept me alive just to speak English? Then what do you want? To know my enemy. I've seen what you do to your enemies. Warriors in your country do not kill? They don't out the heads off defeated, kneeling men. General Hasegawa asked me to help him end his life. A Samurai cannot stand the shame of defeat. I was honored to cut off his head. Many of our customs seem strange to you. The same is true of yours. For example... not to introduce yourself is considered extremely rude, even among enemies. Nathan Algren. I am honored to meet you. - I enjoyed this conversation in English. - I have questions. I have introduced myself. You have introduced yourself. This is a very good conversation. - I have questions. - They come later. Who was the warrior in the red armor? - My brother-in-law, Hirotaro. - And the woman who cares for me? My sister, Hirotaro's wife. Her name is Taka. I killed her husband? It was a good death.  You! Come... Please...   Thank you.  He smells like the pigs. Tell my brother I cannot stand this. Why don't you tell him? At least make him take a bath.  Nicely done.  They may be children, but they are strong.  You try. TW-  Put down the sword.   I just realized, I've been remiss. Forgive me. I have yet to thank you for looking out for me yesterday. That is your job, correct? Protecting me? Well done, Bob. You don't mind if I call you ""Bob,"" do you? I knew a Bob once. God, he was ugly as a mule. You a ladies' man, Bob? Ujio is teaching you the way of the Japanese sword. Yes, indeed. You fought against your Red Indians? Yes. Tell me of your part in this war. - Why? - I wish to learn. - Read a book. - I would rather have a good conversation. - Why? - Because. We are both students of war. Huh? So... you were the general of your army? No. I was a captain. This is a low rank? - A middle rank. - Uh-huh. And who was your general? Don't you have a rebellion to lead? People in your country do not like conversation? He was a lieutenant colonel. His name was Custer. I know this name. He killed many warriors. Oh, yes. Many warriors. So he was a good general. No. No, he wasn't a good general. He was arrogant and foolhardy. He got massacred because he took a battalion against 2000 angry Indians. Two thousand Indians? How many men for Custer? Two hundred and eleven. I like this General Custer. He was a murderer who fell in love with his own legend. And his troopers died for it. I think this is a very good death. Maybe you can have one like it someday. If it is in my destiny. - What do you want from me? - What do you want for yourself? What are you doing? Why are we having these conversations? What the hell am I doing here? In spring-~ the snows will melt and the passes will open. Until that time, you are here. Good day, captain. ALGREN: 1876. Day unknown. Month unknown. I continue to live among these unusual people. I am their captive, in that I cannot escape. Mostly, I'm treated with a kind of a mild neglect... as if I were a stray dog or an unwelcome guest.  Everyone is polite. Everyone smiles and bows. But beneath their courtesy, I detect a deep reservoir of feeling.  ALGREN: They are an intriguing people. From the moment they wake... they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue. I have never seen such discipline. I am surprised to learn that the word ""Samurai"" means ""to serve and that Katsumoto believes his rebellion to be... in the service of the Emperor.    Please forgive. Too many mind. Too many mind? Mind sword, mind people watch, mind enemy. Too many mind. No mind. No mind.   Thank you. More rice? Taka. He spoke Japanese! Eat a lot. Don't be polite.  Not so fast. What are these?   How can he understand?  - Top knot. Top knot. - Top knot.   No, no. Not so fast. I'm Algren. Algren.  Algren. - Nobutada. - Nobutada. - Magojiro. - Magojiro. Higen. Higen. Taka. Brother, please make him leave. I cannot stand it. Is he so repulsive? The shame is unbearable. I ask permission to end my life. You will do as you are told! You'd rather I kill him to avenge your husband? Yes. Hirotaro tried to kill the American. It was karma. I know. Forgive my weakness. There must be some reason why he is here. It is beyond my understanding.  She's been very kind to me. She's honored to have my guest in her house. ALGREN: Winter, 1877. What does it mean to be Samurai? To devote yourself utterly to a set of moral principles... to seek a stillness of your mind... and to master the way of the sword.  He's getting better, no? But still so ugly.  Cold?     Also. Also cold. Fire.    To burn.    No, please. Japanese men do not help with this. I am not Japanese.  I'm sorry.   For your husband, Hirotaro.  He did his duty. You did your duty. I accept your apology...    ALGREN: Spring, 1877. This marks the longest I have stayed in one place since I left the farm at 17 There is so much here that I'll never understand I have never been a church-going man... and what I've seen on the field of battle... has led me to question God's purpose. But there is, indeed, something... spiritual in this place. And though it may forever be obscure to me... I cannot but be aware of its power. I do know it is here that I have known my first untroubled sleep in many years. No, you gotta get the ball! Go and get it. No, not me! You gotta get the ball! The ball!  Ujio will win in three moves. In five! Next in five moves. In six.  No mind.  A draw!  Who is this amateur?  Katsumoto! MAN: Protect Katsumoto! Protect our Lord! Lord, please go inside! Higen!   The perfect blossom is a rare thing. You could spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life. Who sent those men to kill you? I'm writing a poem about a dream I had. The tiger's eyes are like my own But he comes from across A deep and troubled sea Was it the Emperor? Omura? If the Emperor wishes my death, he has but to ask. So it was Omura. I'm having trouble finishing the poem. - Can you suggest a last line? - I'm not a writer. Yet you have written many pages since you came here. What else has she told you? You have nightmares. Every soldier has nightmares. Only one who is ashamed of what he has done. You have no idea what I have done.   You have seen many things. I have. And you do not fear death, but sometimes you wish for it. Is this not so? - Yes. - I, also. It happens to men who have seen what we have seen. And then I come to this place of my ancestors... and I remember. Like these blossoms... we are all dying. To know life in every breath... every cup of tea... every life we take. The way of the warrior. Life in every breath. That is Bushido. Hai.  The Emperor has granted a safe passage to Tokyo. We leave tomorrow. Good. Good. When I took these, you were... my enemy.  Excuse me. No, so sorry, I am finishing. I must go away. Hai. You have been kind to me. I won't forget... Algren-san! Algren-san.    Samurai! BAGLEY: Algren? Algren, my God, you are alive. Well, you never cease to astonish. - Howitzers. - Yes, indeed. As soon as the Emperor signs the trade agreement... he gets the whole package. Including this particular item. Two hundred rounds a minute. And the new cartridges cut down on jamming. I need a bath. After living with those savages, I can only imagine. Welcome back, captain.  Katsumoto. You rise against me, my teacher. No, Highness. I rise against your enemies. They are my advisors, like you. They advise in their own interest. I need advisors who know the modern world. If I am no use, I will happily end my life. No. I need your voice in the council. It is your voice we need, Highness. You are a living god. Do what you think is right. I am a living god... as long as I do what they think is right. What sad words you speak. Forgive me for saying what a teacher must. Have you forgotten your people? Tell me what to do... my teacher.  You are Emperor, my Lord, not me. You must find the wisdom for all of us.  Ah, gentlemen, come in. Captain Algren, it seems you have endured your captivity... with little ill effect. I was not ill-treated, sir. Mr. Omura, I have here a draft of the arms agreement. I'm eager to know how many Samurai have joined Katsumoto. I'm afraid I don't know. - You spent the winter at his encampment. - As his prisoner. Has he fortified his position? Acquired firearms? Tell us what you saw. As you said, colonel, they're savages with bows and arrows. - Sir, about the... - I'm sure your documents are in order. Thank you. Leave them on my desk. I'll address them at the appropriate time. With all due respect, sir, our president's patience is wearing thin. Perhaps there is someone else we should speak to. With all due respect, ambassador... perhaps there is someone else we should speak to. For instance, the French or the English. Or any of the legations waiting in the next room. Yes, well... We should be looking forward to hearing from you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Captain Algren. Perhaps you and I might have a word in private. Please, sit down. - May I offer you whiskey? - No, thank you. Katsumoto is an extraordinary man, is he not? He's a tribal leader. I've known many of them. But none who are Samurai. Their ways have great appeal. - I don't see how this concerns me. - Ah, but it does. You see, you were right. Last year, we were not prepared to go to battle. You were right, and Colonel Bagley was wrong. But now, we are ready. If Katsumoto is allowed to attract other Samurai to his cause... we will have 10 years of rebellion. This is something I will not allow. Either I'll stop him at the council today, or you'll lead my army against him. And with these new weapons, you will crush him. - I appreciate the offer. - It is not an offer. Mr. Omura, my contract with you was to train your army. Then we will make a new contract... one that will recognize the extraordinary contribution... you've made to the Emperor. Do we understand each other? - Yes, we understand each other perfectly. - Then I am pleased.  Follow him. If he goes anywhere near Katsumoto, kill him.  Captain Algren! What in heaven's name is going on? The diplomatic community is abuzz. Omura has passed laws against the Samurai. I need a drink. Is your friend Katsumoto planning to go up against the council this afternoon?  You, Samurai! Don't you know about the order?  It's started.  Hey boy, are you listening? No wonder the foreigners mock you. Let's give this Samurai a haircut. Cut off his top knot. Get down! Kneel!  Captain Algren!  Lower your weapons! Lower your weapons! Who are you? I am Captain Algren.  S'tOp! S'EOP- Get down!  Let's go.  I'll take you home.  Jolly good.  We must resist the Western powers... by becoming powerful ourselves. Our army, our economy, must be strong. Minister, you honor us. It is my honor to rejoin this council. Perhaps you are unaware of the law against wearing swords? I read every law carefully. Yet you bring weapons into this chamber? This chamber was protected by my sword when... We need no protection. We are a nation of laws. We are a nation of whores, selling ourselves. If we are whores, the Samurai made us this way. I have not seen the Omura family giving gold to the masses. Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regret... but I must ask you to remove your sword. This sword serves the Emperor. Only he can command me to remove it. The Emperor's voice is too pure to be heard in this council. Then, I must refuse to give up my sword. Then regretfully, my guards will accompany you to your home in Tokyo. There you will await our summons.   I heard you were leaving. Omura offers you my job, and you run away. I suppose I should thank you. $500 a month, including back pay for time spent... in captivity. Enough to climb back inside a bottle for the rest of your life. You're welcome. Well, it is pretty much over. Katsumoto's under arrest. Omura won't let him last the night. With him dead, we should have little trouble handling the rebellion... even without you. Especially without you. Just tell me one thing. What is it about your own people that you hate so much?  Save us the trouble...  The Samurai are finished!  MAN: Stop! Don't come any closer!  Don't stop. Whatever you do, don't stop.  Minister Omura has commanded us to photograph the traitor... Stop! Somebody! Bring that equipment here now! Immediately! You stop! You insolent, useless son of a peasant dog! How dare you show your sword in his presence! Do you know who this is? This is the President of the United States of America! He is here to lead our armies in victorious battle against the rebels! It's not my responsibility... Now get over there and help those men with their equipment! Carry the equipment.  President of the United States? Sorry. I think I'm going to be sick.   How's your poem coming? The end is proving difficult. This is Mr. Simon Graham. He'd like very much to take your photograph.   I thought you returned to America. I decided to stay. See if I could convince you to escape. How do you plan to do that?  Mr. Graham, perhaps you would care to take pictures of my village. GRAHAM: I would be greatly honored.     My Lord, no! Nobutada! Father, let me stay. It is my time. My Lord... we must go.   The Emperor could not hear my words. His army will come. It is the end. For 900 years, my ancestors have protected our people. Now... I have failed them. So you will take your own life... in shame? Shame for a life of service? Discipline? Compassion? The way of the Samurai is not necessary anymore. Necessary? What could be more necessary? I will die by the sword. My own... or my enemy's. Then let it be your enemy's. Together, we will make the Emperor hear you.  He was a good man. Will you fight the white men, too? If they come here, yes. Why? Because they come to destroy what I have come to love. The way of Samurai is difficult for children. He misses his father. And he is angry... because I am the cause of that. No. He is angry because he fears you will die as well. My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle. That is what he believed. I would be afraid to die in battle. So would I. But you have been in many battles. And I was always afraid. I don't want you to go. Algren. They are coming.  I'd say two full regiments. They'll come in waves of a thousand. And they have the howitzers. It makes no difference. They will come, and we will make our stand. - How many men will we have? - Maybe 500. Like General Custer, huh? There was once a battle at a place called Thermopylae. Three hundred brave Greeks held off a Persian army of a million men. A million. You understand this number? I understand this number. For two days the Greeks made them pay so dearly... the Persian army lost all taste for battle and were defeated soon after. - What do you have in mind? - Take away the advantage of their guns. They're overconfident. We'll use that. Lure them close. Close enough for a sword. You believe... a man can change his destiny? I think a man does what he can... until his destiny is revealed to him. ALGREN: May 25th, 1877 This will be the last entry in this journal. I've tried to give a true accounting of what I have seen, what I have done. I do not presume to understand the course of my life. I know I am grateful to have partaken of all this... even if for a moment.  Algren-san, will you come with me? If you wear this armor, it will honor us.   You will need this. What does it say? ""I belong to the warrior in whom the old ways have joined the new.""   Good God. Sir, the Imperial Army of Japan demands your surrender. If you lay down your arms, you will not be harmed. This is not possible, as Mr. Omura knows. Captain Algren. We will show you no quarter. You ride against us, and you are the same as them. I'll look for you on the field. Captain Algren. Mr. Graham. Perhaps you can use these for your book. Yes, I will. Captain. Godspeed. Mr. Graham.    Well, they won't surrender. Are we ready? Get into your positions!     Commence firing!    BAGLEY: They're covering their retreat. OMURA: You see? Even the mighty Samurai cannot stand up to the howitzers. - Signal the attack. - I advise sending in skirmishers first. Nonsense! Full attack!   They're coming.   Wait for the volley. Second volley.   What on earth? What is happening?    The attack has been stopped. Send in the rest of the regiment. What happened to the warriors at Thermopylae? Dead to the last man.   Algren-san!      Son of a bitch thinks he can win.   They'll bring two more regiments up here soon. We won't be able to stop them again. You do not have to die here. I should have died so many times before. Now, you live again. Yes. It was not your time. It's not over. What is this?  Cannon, prepare to fire! Prepare to fire!  This is madness. - He's going to attack? - Yes. He's defeated! He must accept his shame! Kill him. All of them. NQW! BAGLEY: My horse!  Fire!    Ready! Aim! Fire! Fire at will!  Bring up the new guns! Prepare the new guns! Fire!  Backward!  Quickly! Quickly! Fire! Stop firing! Idiots, keep on firing! Stop firing! Stop!  No.  Shoot! Kill Katsumoto! Kill the American!  You have your honor again. Let me die with mine. Help me up. Are you ready? I will miss our conversations.  Perfect. They are all... perfect. MAN: On behalf of the United States of America... the signing of this treaty will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity... and cooperation between our two great nations. On behalf of the Emperor... we are pleased to have successfully concluded this... .""negofiafion.   He is here?   Highness, if we could just conclude the matter at hand...  This is Katsumoto's sword. He would have wanted you to have it... that the strength of the Samurai be with you always.  Enlightened One, we all weep for Katsumoto, but...  He hoped... with his last breath... that you would remember the ancestors who held this sword... and what they died for.  Your Highness...  You were with him... at the end? Hai.  Emperor, this man fought against you! Your Highness... if you believe me to be your enemy, command me... and I will gladly take my life. I have dreamed of a unified Japan... of a country strong and independent and modern. And now we have rail roads and cannon, Western clothing. But... we cannot forget who we are... or where we come from. Ambassador Swanbeck... I have concluded that your treaty... is not in the best interest of my people. - Sir, if I may... - So sorry... but you may not. This is an outrage!  Enlightened One... - we should discuss this... - Omura... you have done quite enough. Everything I have done, I have done for my country. Then you will not mind when I seize your family's assets... and present them as my gift to the people. You disgrace me. If your shame is too unbearable... I offer you this sword.  Tell me how he died. I will tell you how he lived. GRAHAM: And so the days of the Samurai had ended. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have their own destiny. As for the American captain... no one knows what became of him. Some say that he died of his wounds... others, that he returned to his own country. But I like to think he may have at last found some small measure of peace... that we all seek... and few of us ever find. , Basic principles: No woman wakes up saying: ""God, I hope I don't get swept off my feet today."" Now, she might say, ""This is a really bad time for me."" Or something like, ""I just need some space."" Or my personal favorite: ""I'm really into my career right now."" You believe that? Neither does she. You know why? Because she's lying to you, that's why. You understand me? Lying. It's not a bad time for her. She doesn't need any space. She may be into her career... but what she's really saying is, ""Get away from me now."" Or possibly, ""Try harder, stupid."" Well, which one is it? 60% of all human communication is nonverbal. Body language. 30% is your tone. So that means that 90% of what you're saying... ain't coming out of your mouth. Toby! Shit! Of course she'll lie to you. She's a nice person, she doesn't wanna hurt your feelings. What else is she gonna say? She doesn't even know you. Yet. Luckily, the fact is that just like the rest of us... even a beautiful woman doesn't know what she wants until she sees it. And that's where I come in. My job is to open her eyes. Oh, my God! Is this what you're looking for? Basic principles: No matter what, no matter when, no matter who... any man has a chance to sweep any woman off her feet. Just needs the right broom. You cannot use what you do not have. So if you're shy, be shy. If you're outgoing, be outgoing. - I'm not outgoing. - That's okay. She may not want the whole truth, but she does want the real you. She may not want to see it all at once, but she does want to see it. So tonight, when you're wondering what to say, how you look, or if she likes you... just remember, she is already out with you. That means she said yes when she could have said no. That means she made a plan when she could have just blown you off. So that means it is no longer your job to try to make her like you. It is your job not to mess it up. The shoes are hot. You went to the place I told you? Yeah, but I don't think they're really me. ""You"" is a very fluid concept right now. You bought the shoes. You look great in the shoes. That's the you I'm talking about. The key tonight is hang back. Give her plenty of space. If she lingers at a photograph, move on. But maintain the visual. It's supposed to be 64 and clear tonight. So when you leave the club, walk a little. Ask her what she thought about the show... what was her favorite photograph, why that one. And when she answers, don't be looking at her mouth. Don't be wondering what she looks like naked. Listen to what she is saying and respond. Listen and respond. That way, when it's your turn to talk... you'll have something better to say than, ""I like your mouth."" What was your favorite one? The elephant, definitely. And all of a sudden, we're on date number two. Ready. No way. We're going back in there. You have to smile. In case you didn't go to high school, hitting is a good thing. So how does it happen, great love? Are you okay? - Nobody knows. - I'm good. Let me get a Bomb Pop and a Screwball for the lady. But what I can tell you, is that it happens in the blink of an eye. One moment, you're enjoying your life. And the next, you're wondering how you ever lived without them. Three dates is all I need. Three dates, and I'll get you here, to the high-stakes medal round... where eight out of 10 women believe that the first kiss... will tell them everything they need to know about the relationship. After that, you're on your own. But always remember... life is not the amount of breaths you take. It's the moments that take your breath away. Did I call it or did I call it? I mean, what did I say, six months? And when was her first date? So five-and-a-half? God, I hate it when I'm right. What is it about guys that makes them want to screw anything that walks... even when they're going out with someone as awesome as Allegra Cole? She's only the most fabulous thing walking around New York. Thanks, Young. Are you kidding? Of course I'm gonna run it. Why should she waste her heart on some Swedish aristo-brat? Even if he is gorgeous. If he's stupid enough to cheat... the world should know he's dumb enough to get caught. Exactly. I'm in the elevator. See you in a minute. Good morning, how are you? Bitter, party of one. You should try it sometime. Barbados by myself? I wouldn't last five minutes. It was just what the doctor ordered. I slept in, I did my yoga, I read a couple of books... flirted with my scuba instructor. - And apparently never left the office. - I know, isn't that great? You should've taken someone with you. Who am I gonna take with me? This is where a boyfriend comes in handy. - I don't have time for a boyfriend. - You said that two years ago. Yes, and it's as true today as it was then. I thought you were on vacation. See if these are in focus and have them in my desk in an hour. Besides, relationships are for people waiting for something better to come along. Spoken like a true cynic. I'm not a cynic. I'm a realist. You are a realist masquerading as a cynic who is secretly an optimist. What are you doing here? What is she doing here? She works here, remember? No, she doesn't. Not for another four days. - This couldn't wait. - It could. What are you doing? Go back to the beach. - I don't want you here. - No, really, you do. You are becoming a sick, workaholic lunatic... and this is exactly... the kind of nervous, overwrought behavior that leads to... Pictures of Sebby with a busty brunette. A very big raise. Jesus. You could find dirt in a snowstorm. Comes with the job. You know, kiddo, there is more to life than watching other people live it. Can I help he was cheating on my beach? I think it's great that you're so good at your job. I'm just a little worried as to why. Let me worry about that. Okay. I want that column on my desk by lunch. So you'll pay for my hotel? For you to sip mai tais? I don't think so. Get out. - Come on. - What? - That's good, right? - No. No, it was in and it freaked out. You know what your problem is, Hitch? You're all about the short game. You pick your shots based on what you see first... not what's necessarily best for you... in the long run. All of us are not married to the woman of our dreams and about to have a baby. You know, I'm very happy for you. Just not meant for everybody. So please just leave me to my hot, sweaty... totally varied, wildly experimental short game. - I was talking about pool, but whatever. - Yeah, okay. Honestly, I just hope one day you're able to experience... the unconditional love, trust, and openness... that I share with Grace every single day. - Is this really barroom talk? - You need to listen to me. I'm serious. Because when you get to a place with a woman like that... it's so beyond anything physical that... when I think back to when I used to run around with you... and chase all these really gorgeous but shallow women... I don't know, it's kind of ridiculous and vaguely pathetic. Yeah, I see what you mean. That's pathetic. So, how'd you meet him? I was in La Perla just buying some weekend thongs. - And he was doing likewise? - No. Actually, he said he was buying something for his mom. His mom? Casey, who buys high-priced lingerie for their mother? Well, maybe he was looking for a robe. Casey, he was hitting on you while he was buying lingerie for another woman. - I prefer the mother story. - I know you do, but that's not the point. No, the point is I'm not gonna start out assuming the guy's a liar. - Why not? - Because that's how you wind up... Like me? Is that what you were gonna say? No. I was gonna say, ""Like you."" - What's his name? - Why? - I'm gonna Google him. - No. Google your own guy. Let's just see if his mother's still alive. - So when is Grace due again? - Soon. - You excited? - What'd you say? Do you want me to go get them and bring them over here? No, don't do that. Are you saying you don't wanna talk to them because you can't go home with them? I'm just trying to keep my head above water. - Have you heard of the Date Doctor? - Urban myth. - Really? - Absolutely. I was hoping he also helped women. Casey, you're not sick. You're single. You just have to relax and enjoy the ride. I haven't been ridden in months. On that happy note, I'm gonna go see if anybody interesting came in tonight. - You mean, besides me. - Right. Bye. I'll go get those girls, bring them over here... and we'll have a conversation like human beings. Then you're gonna home, and I'll take them back to my apartment. Well, that sounds like fun for me. But you might want to get in line, pal. - Hey, girl. - Hey, how are you? Hey, baby, can I get a couple Coronas at the pool table, please? Thanks. Excuse me. Lime wedges in the bottle's fine. Hey, asshole, I don't work here. I'm sorry. The paramedics will have to come to get my foot out of my mouth, sweetheart. Just don't let it happen again. - I knew you didn't work here. - You did? How else was I supposed to get you away from all those guys? Why would you want to do that? Some guys naturally develop a comfort with the opposite sex. They like women, women like them. Everything flows naturally. Back in college, I was just not one of them. I seemed to lack the basic understanding... that my peers just intuitively grasped. But like any late bloomer, I was eager to make up for lost time. Her name was Cressida Baylor. Can you tell me where the registration building is? And my life would never be the same. - I'm Alex. - Cressida. What we had was beautiful. I love you. I love you so much. I love you, too, Alex. I know you don't love me as much as I love you. But that's okay. I'm just glad you love me at all. In retrospect, I guess I may have come on a little strong. But the experience taught me a lot. Cressida! What are you doing? I'm sorry, Alex. But I love you. What did I do wrong? Just tell me what I did wrong. You're doing it right now. Alex, I'm sorry. And it's an education I feel obliged to pass on to my fellow men. Because with no guile and no game, there's no girl. If ever a man born was without game... it was Albert Brennaman. My business is 100% referral and, thus far, untraceable. And if there's one thing I've learned... when you orchestrate, coordinate, and otherwise mess with fate... it's best to fly under the radar. I hope she's single 'cause I don't do break-ups. Hi. Thank you for seeing me. Yeah, no. I mean, she just got out of a relationship. Is that a problem? Because if it is, that's fine. I'm a little uncomfortable with this anyway. Definitely been hurt a lot. I had a lot of bad experiences. Some good ones. But definitely a lot of bad ones. I'm desperate, basically. I mean, not in general, you understand? You know, not just for anybody. But, man, for her... Yeah. Why don't you tell me about her? Let's see, what can I say? My company handles her finances. I'm her tax consultant. Well, I'm one of them. I'm the junior man on the account. - So does she know you're interested? - No. Alive? I lent her my pen once. Shoot. Does anyone have a pen? - Here, take mine. - Albert, you're crushing my arm. Sorry about that. Here you go, Allegra. Allegra? As in Allegra Cole? Yeah, I realize that I'm not her usual type. Well, her last boyfriend owned Sweden or something. And that guy was a bum. He didn't seem like a very nice person to me. You swing for the fence. Look, you don't think I tried talking myself out of this? I mean, you don't think I know how ridiculous this is? I know, okay? I just thought that maybe with your help... You know what? I'm really sorry I wasted your time. Hold on a second, Albert. You know what it's like getting up every morning feeling hopeless? Feeling like the love of your life is waking up with the wrong man? But at the same time, hoping that she still finds happiness... even if it's never gonna be with you? You are flat-out... out of your mind. You know that? That's good. It is? You ever heard of Michelangelo? Heard of the Sistine Chapel? Michelangelo. Sistine Chapel. You saying you can do this? My name is Alex Hitchens. Let's go paint that ceiling. Take it easy. Oh, my God! Well, it looks like I'm still rich. But what I would really like, and what I was wondering is... if I could have $500,000 to invest on my own. And what were you thinking of investing in, Allegra? Well, it's something that I really have a passion for. Daydreams are for private time. When you're in the room, be in the room. Concentrate. Focus. Women respond when you respond to them. My friend Maggie is a talented designer. I've seen the business plan and the samples look fantastic. And I would really like to get involved. I'll tell you what. Let us come up with a range of investments that we think you might be interested in... and next month, we'll run the whole lot of them by you. Okay. Fine. Thank you. All right, gentlemen. Let's go over this one more time. What is the objective? Shock and awe. That was shockingly awful. What is the objective? Shock and awe. What is the objective? - Excuse me, sir. - Yes, Albert? I don't really agree with that. You don't really agree with what? I think if you want to invest $500,000 in your friend's business... that's exactly what you should do. You don't need us to tell you what to do. We're a board of advisers, not your kindergarten teachers. If you want to be taken seriously as an adult... then start taking yourself seriously as an adult... instead of asking for permission to invest your own money... from a boardroom full of your daddy's golf buddies. - That's quite enough! - I'm not finished. I'd like to see anybody in this room handle the attention and publicity... that she's had to deal with her whole life, with half her class. We should be taking advice from you, Miss Cole. Not the other way around. - Sit down... - No! You know what? I quit! Oh, my God. Just breathe. How'd it go? I yelled at her. I screamed at my boss! I quit my job! - What? - You said... - I gotta go back. - No, I didn't tell you to quit. Relax. Okay, listen, we're fine. - Would you let me go? - Albert, no! Just relax! Okay? - Just let it marinate for a second. Trust me. - No! Relax. - It's Allegra Cole. - Answer it. - Could I speak to you a second? - Answer the door, Albert. Yes. Hi. What's up? Listen, Albert, right? - People don't usually talk to me like that. - Close your mouth, man. Let me rephrase that. People never talk to me like that. Stand up. I guess it's kind of scary for them. But that's why I really appreciate what you did in there. But I was wondering... do you think that you and I could get together sometime this week? You know, to go over things. Financial things. I'd like to see the areas where I can afford to take some risks. - Check your schedule. - I'll check my schedule. Great. Let me give you my number. Do you have a pen? I don't think I have one. - Yes, I do. - Great. And call me Allegra. - You're done. - Goodbye. Good job. Oh, damn. She's some kind of newspaper columnist. Comes in here once in a while. Great tipper. What's her drink? Usually beer. Tonight, Grey Goose martini, dirty. Hi. I noticed your glass was getting low... so I took the liberty of bringing you another apple martini. Thank you. And I couldn't help but notice you look a lot like my next girlfriend. - What's your name? - They call me Chip. You can't get them to stop? That was funny. Listen, I understand the courage it takes to walk across a room... and try to generate a relationship out of thin air. - So don't take the following personally. - You have fantastic eyes. Thanks. Try to listen. This is no reflection on you. I'm just not interested. But thank you for the compliment of coming over. You're welcome. So do you like Cuban food? Chip, seriously, that was not code for, ""I wish you'd try harder."" Are you always so shut-down and afraid that the right man might make you... Feel like a natural woman? Sorry I'm late, honey. I couldn't get a cab. How was the meeting? Well, there was a beginning, a middle, and an end. Nice to meet you, Chip. You, too. On the one hand, it is very difficult for a man... to even speak to someone who looks like you. But on the other hand, should that be your problem? So life's kind of hard all around. Not if you pay attention. You're sending all the right signals: no earrings, heels under two inches, your hair is pulled back... wearing reading glasses with no book, drinking a Grey Goose martini... which means you had a hell of a week and a beer just wouldn't do it. If that wasn't clear enough... there's always the ""fuck off"" that you have stamped on your forehead. Who'd believe there's a man out there that can sit by a woman he doesn't know... and genuinely be interested in who she is, what she does, without his own agenda? I wouldn't even know what that would look like. So what would a guy like that say? He'd say, ""My name is Alex Hitchens and I'm a consultant."" But she wouldn't be interested in that... because she'd be counting the seconds until he left. Thinking he was like every other guy. Which, life experience has taught her, is a virtual certainty. But then he'd ask her name and what she did for a living... and she might blow him off. Or she might say... I'm Sara Melas. I run the gossip column at the Standard. And then he'd ask all these penetrating questions about her... because he was sincerely, if atypically, interested. No. - No? - He'd be interested. But he'd see that there was no way... he could possibly make her realize that he was for real. Well, he could be funny and charming and refreshingly original. Wouldn't help. - Don't you hate it when that happens? - Not really. They'd both probably go on to lead the lives they were headed toward. My guess is they'd do just fine. It's a pleasure to have met you, Sara Melas. Grey Goose martini from the gentleman who just left. Is that for me? What? Vance Munson. Sorry I'm late. No, not a problem. Wow, you're the... - Can I get you something to drink, Mr... - No, I'm fine, thank you. So, tell me about her. Have you ever met someone... and you knew right away she was gonna be important to you? Not just because of her looks, but that X factor. How'd you meet her? Actually, I was in a shop buying pajamas for my mom. And by that, of course, you mean... you were buying lingerie for another woman. Yes. You can't help where you meet somebody. And the lingerie is for a woman I'm no longer seeing. But anyway, the girl I met, the one I was talking about... she's so sweet, funny, Southern. She gives me her number. Now she won't return my phone calls. I don't know what it is about her. I just can't get her out of my mind. You know, food has lost its taste. Colors, they seem dull. Things that used to matter... I don't know, they just no longer do. I think things aren't gonna snap back unless I... Unless I bang her. Excuse me? You know, bang her. Clear my head. Get in, get off, get out. I think you may have misunderstood what I do exactly. No, I was told you help guys get in there. Right. But, see, here's the thing. My clients actually like women. Hit it and quit it is not my thing. Let me make one thing clear to you, rabbi. I need professional help. Well, that is for damn certain. And I'm glad you can admit it because generally that's the hardest part. You see what I'm doing? This is what I'm about. Power suit, power tie, power steering. People can wince, cry, beg, but eventually they do what I want. So that's, like, a metaphor. Well, I'm more of a literal kind of guy. So when I do this... this is more like me saying that I will literally break your shit off... if you ever touch me again. Okay, pumpkin? Got it. No. Pablo, I can't just mention your restaurant. Somebody has to eat there. No, somebody famous. You know that. - Sara Melas? - No. Okay. Bye. I need your signature. I hate it when a guy calls a girl who did not give him her number. So this is me not calling. Over. Yes, you're right. This is much less invasive. I've been thinking about that sign on your forehead. And I was wondering if you'd mind taking it down for dinner Friday night. Over. I can't. I have a couple of parties I have to hit. Gossip never sleeps. Not till about 4:00 a.m. Saturday. I have a date. Do you know the definition of ""perseverance,"" Miss Melas? An excuse to be obnoxious? Continuing in a course of action... without regard to discouragement, opposition or previous failure. Over. Okay, Webster, how do I get rid of you? Breakfast, Sunday. And you can barely even call that a date. You do that with out-of-town relatives that you don't even like. Over. Come on. Okay, I guess I could do Sunday. You forgot to say ""over."" Over. This conversation's over as soon as you tell me when and where. 7:00 a.m., North Cove Marina. Over and out. 7:00 a.m.? Are you crazy? I don't do 7:00 a.m. - Hello? - Sign here. - What? - You said Sunday, right? Yeah. What if I would have said Friday? Sunday. So I guess you're not going to church. Do you really expect me to wear this? lt'll be awful cold out there without it. - Good morning. - ""Good"" would have been at 10:00. You're a lot taller than I remember. You ever ride one of these? Not on the Hudson. So, what do you wanna do? Race me around the Statue of Liberty? If there's time. - But you might need these. - All right. - Bam. - Wow. How do I look? Fabulous. All right, I give. Where do I change? So we'll go past the wall, then take a left. It's pretty much a straight shot from there. - Straight shot to where? - That's for me to know and you to find out. What you do with these babies is... Yeah, what I do with this baby is kick your ass. - What happened? You change your mind? - It just died. Did you put gas in it? No. You know, I think it must have sucked up a diaper or something. Gross. Try it again. You want me to call AAA? Come on around and let me hop on with you. I don't know. What if you break mine, too? Then we'll both be sitting ducks. - I didn't break it. It just died. - Yeah, yeah. All right, hop on. - Scoot back. - Hitch, I'm already here. But you don't know where we're going. Why don't you tell me? Then we'll both know. Man, male egos. I don't know how you guys make it through the day with them. What? It is not my ego. I just don't want to ruin the surprise. I'm sorry. Are you all right? There. I always keep a few of those around. Thank you. I have lower back trouble. I just shove the ice packs right down there. No. That's a fresh one. So, Ellis Island. I have to admit, I have lived in New York my whole life and I've never been here. I figured that. Most people haven't. So I got my man Larry here to set us up a private tour. - Great! - Anything for Hitch. It was originally known as Oyster Island. The island was expanded to its present size... with dirt removed during the construction of the New York subway system. - Are you serious? - Yes. - Did you know this? - Yeah. That's why I brought you here. In fact, over 100 million Americans can trace their ancestry... back to a single man, woman, or child on the ship's manifest... to an inspector's ledger. By 1910, 75%% of the residents of New York... Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Boston... were immigrants, or the children of immigrants. They generally lived in the poorest sections of the cities... in Little Italys, Chinatowns and other ethnic enclaves. It's called The Kissing Post. The plaque explains how different cultures kiss after long absences. Now, what exactly would qualify as a long absence? I mean... - That count? - No. I actually had a relative come through here. - Really? - Yeah. What? - What? - What was that thing? No. You know, I was just thinking... you can't really know where you're going until you know where you've been. - Ain't that right, Larry? - Amen, brother. That's kind of deep for a first date, don't you think? What is that? Oh, my God! That's my great-great-grandfather. That's his signature. Jesus, it's right here! How did you know? Hitch did the search. I just found the page. I'm sorry. I saw that going differently in my mind. So my family never saw him again. Well, except for on the Wanted posters. Look, I'm really sorry. When I saw it on the computer, it said, ""the Butcher of Cdiz."" I thought it was a profession, not a headline. It's just one of those horrible family legacies we've all tried to forget. But thank you. No, it was... - A train wreck. - No. Let me get you a cab. Thanks. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Taxi! Poor guy. Sounds like he went to a lot of trouble. It was fun. In a disastrous kind of way. I mean, this isn't exactly a hickey. At least you got a good story out of it, right? Right? - You should try mine, it's great. - Wait. You're seeing him again? Well, look, you said that I'm always expecting men... to let me down, right? Assuming that they're gonna fail? Which he did. Yeah, but he did it with flair. I mean, Case, he really tanked. And that's a desirable trait? Yeah. Weird, huh? Now, just keep it simple. Just like we practiced. We're just leaving a message. Women like Allegra Cole don't pick up numbers they don't recognize. Hello? She's on the phone! - Yes. Hello, Miss Cole? - Yeah. Hi, I have Albert Brennaman for you. - One moment, please. - No. Tell her I'm at lunch. We called her to tell her you're at lunch? Allegra. Hi, it's Albert Brennaman. Hi, how are you? Good. I'm doing good. The reason I'm calling is about our appointment this Wednesday. Not gonna be able to make it. Well, when can you make it? When can I do it? I don't even know, because my whole next week is slammed. Right. But it's all good. No, we're gonna make it happen though, that's for sure. We're going to make it happen. Yes. What's going on over there? Just moving some things around. Sky Studios. Tonight I'm actually going to this fashion thing at Sky Studios. Designer friend. I just thought it might be something your designer friend would be interested in. Yeah, definitely. Well, great. Then I will put you back on with my... - Allegra, over here, please. - Miss Cole, this way. Great. One more. - Hi, there. - This was a fantastic idea. I suppose. Hey, where's Maggie? Late as usual. Tonight I want you to meditate on the image of an iceberg. Do you know why I want you to do that? Because I'm cool? - No. - I know, I'm not. I'm saying that you are an iceberg... in that over 90%% of your mass is below the surface. I know I'm heavy. I am. I'm talking about who you are. It's a metaphor. Accounting, business... all of that is just a small part of a much deeper, richer Albert. One more. It's gonna be loud in there... so this is our opportunity to break the touch barrier... in a non-sleazy way. So get to where it's loudest. Ask her if she'd like a drink. Lean in, place your hand on the small of her back... and say it in her ear like a secret. Watch your hand placement. Too high says, ""I just wanna be friends."" Too low says, ""I just wanna grab some ass."" Friends. Ass. Me. Special issues: Allegra Cole is a celebrity... which means that when people talk to her, they'll ignore you completely. She's classy, so she'll introduce you. When she does, shake hands hard and speak up. Let them know you're there. Show her you can handle being her escort. - Egon, this is Albert. - How you doing? - Albert, this is Zak. - Nice to see you. These guys are friends with Maggie. - Been to that new Brazilian restaurant? - No, but I am... It's disgusting. I'm writing an article about it. Did you see the new installation at MOMA? - Yes, did you think... - Disgusting. Women can always tell when you're not being real with them. Worst thing you can do is try to fake it, because you are a great guy. And you do have something to offer Allegra that no other man does. What was your name? Eggnog? Egon. What do you think of the design of the Jets' new football stadium on the West Side? Let me guess. Disgusting? Think it over. We'll be back. Thank you. I can't stand those guys. Really? I kind of liked them. But when all is said and done... tonight is not about Allegra. - It's not? - No. Tonight is about Maggie. A woman's best friend has to sign off on all big relationship decisions. So you can't afford to mess this up. Albert, I want you to meet my friend, Maggie. Hi, Maggie. It's an absolute pleasure to meet you. I'm Maggie. - No, you're not. - Actually, I am. Magnus Forester. Thank you so much for inviting us. - You have very soft hands. - Thank you. - Wow. So do you. - Thank you. So tonight, you focus on one thing and one thing only. Maggie. - Where does your inspiration come from? - Oh, my God. Anything I see. Something in a magazine, out on the street... in an old movie. The receptive nature of the creative facility just astounds me. Anybody want any spring rolls? That's a beautiful tie, by the way. This whole thing, it just works. Thank you. - Is he gay? - I don't think so. I like him. About the deejay. Generally, I have a firm no-dancing policy. But if she asks, you cannot say no. I'm not worried about dancing. But if there are people there... I'm sorry, I hate to be a stickler, but I need to be thorough. Show me what you mean by you're not worried about it. Trust me. You know what I'm gonna do. That's what it's all about, right there. See how it gets bigger? Now I'm gonna start the fire. But the feet are going. I start the fire, I make the pizza. Hips are always going. Can't get enough hip. From there, the Q-Tip. Q-Tip. Throw it away. That's not working, hit them with this. Don't ever... do that again. Do you hear me? - Just expressing myself. - No. Not like that, you're not, all right? This is where you live. Right here. You live right here, okay? This is home. None of this. I don't wanna see none of that. Don't need no pizza. They got food there. Elbows, 6 inches from the waist, 90-degree angles. Don't you bite your lip. Stop it. Women relate dancing to sex, all right? Even a great dancer can lose it with one of these. Okay, now that's what I need to be learning. Can't stop it. You cannot stop it. Next subject. Get out. Thanks. So, are you a Knicks fan? When they're good. - I'm really sorry. - Oh, God. Why? - She was there? - I left you a bunch of messages. My phone fell in the Hudson. Yeah, well, it gets worse. I don't believe this. - I thought he was a bodyguard. - I'm the only one who will need protection. - Max is gonna... - Gonna be really irritated. When I got the train this morning, I thought it was gonna be a good day. Who the hell is Albert Brennaman? - Tell me how this happened. - What? There were some photographers. Does this even look like dancing to you? That's just a little bit of me being me. No, that's you being a lot of something you don't need to ever be again. - It's just one dance. - No. One dance, one look, one kiss. That's all we get, Albert. Just one shot to make the difference... between happily ever after and: ""Oh, he's just some guy I went to some thing with once."" All right? - What? - You said ""kiss."" Is that a problem? It's not a problem, but this is Allegra Cole. Eight out of 10 women believe that the first kiss... will tell them everything they need to know about a relationship. And believe me, she has definitely thought about it. - She has? - Of course. Not that she's gonna act on it. So it's no real big deal. - All right, it's no big deal then. - It's a very big deal! - Huge. - Monumental! You are not listening... I need you to wrap your head around this. Tomorrow night, Allegra Cole... could have her last first kiss. All right, come on, just show me what you got. - What do you mean? - Just show me how you would kiss me. I wouldn't kiss you. I'm not me, I'm Allegra. But you're really not, so... Okay, Albert, end of the night, you're dropping me off at home. - Show me the magic. - I'm not comfortable with this. God, Albert, I had such a wonderful time with you. Yeah, how about those Knicks? You see what I'm doing? This is a signal. I'm fiddling with my keys. A woman that doesn't want a kiss... takes her keys out, puts them in the door, goes in the house. A woman that wants to kiss, she fiddles. I'm fiddling. Okay, you have a good night now... - You see what I'm doing? - Robbing me? No. This is what most guys do. They rush in to take the kiss. But you're not most guys. See, the secret to a kiss is to go 90%% of the way... and then hold. - For how long? - As long as it takes... for her to come the other 10%% . Okay, 90%% -10%% . Got it. Okay, come on. Shake it off. It's your turn. I had a really nice time tonight, Albert. I had a great time tonight, too, Allegra... with a beard. What's up? - I'm not feeling it. - What do you mean? I came 90%% . I'm not feeling like you want it. Look, I'm Allegra Cole, the woman of your dreams. The woman whose green eyes are limpid pools of desire. Now, show me the magic, Albert. - What the hell was that? - I'm showing you the magic! No, I said come 90%% and then I come 10%%! You don't go the whole 100%%! My mouth was open, Albert. You overeager son of a... Other than that, how was it? They came together, they danced together, and they left together. He's cute, in a sheepdog kind of way. For all I know, he's adorable. But him dating her is... You seem stressed. You and I had an understanding. If you invite Allegra, you're supposed to call me. I didn't invite her. Honestly, sweetie, I thought she was still in Europe. - So you invited Albert? - No. Look, it says here the tickets went to some guy named Alex Hitchens. What? Machine. Hi, it's Sara. I just wanted to say thank you... for an unforgettable experience... the other day. And if you ever want to see your shirt again... you can come by the Fulton Fish Market tonight, around 8:00. Okay, bye. - Do you think he'll show? - Yeah. He's too much of a player to have a bad date on his record. Is this a source or a date? A source. Well, it sounded like a date. Well, it was supposed to. So it looks like a date and it sounds like a date... - but it's not a date. - Yeah. Right. Just checking. Hi. I wasn't sure you got my message. I wasn't sure you called the right guy. You must be a glutton for punishment. Either that or I really wanna pay you back. I think this is yours. Thank you. I'm gonna frame this for my wall of shame. Really? There's a whole wall? So what are we getting into? Ever been to a food rave before? Happens once a month, all around the city. Different chefs, different venues. You any good in the kitchen? I can stand the heat, if that's what you mean. Good. Because that's my boss and his wife right over there. Interesting. Well, here's a concept: We're paying to cook our own food. Here's another concept: Shut up. It's an evening out. The longer you're married, the less you go out. In a couple of years, we're gonna end up bricked into our apartment like a Poe story. So, Louise, are you in the newspaper business, also? No, I'm a psychiatrist. Well, that's the last thing I'm gonna say tonight. So, Sara, you never told me. How was the Sky Studio fashion thing you went to the other night? Did you meet anyone worth mentioning? No. Really? I find that very odd. - Max. - I think you're being odd. Well, I'm always odd. It's why you married me. And it's why I married you. Speaking of which, Hitch... what exactly are your intentions for the lovely Sara? Wait, you know what? Actually, there was someone. I think I met your friends Albert and Allegra. - My friends who and who? - Allegra Cole? Really? How do you know her? - I don't. - So you know Albert? - Knew. - He had your tickets. I mean, how well do you really know your accountant? April 15, and then you don't see him again till April 15. Ladies and gentlemen... a coquille St. Jacques with a lemon butter reduction. - Compliments of our chef. - Thank you. I'm sure you're really gonna enjoy this. That's really good. I'm very impressed. Why is that? Around these two, people usually can't wait to name-drop and dish their friends... and you're being all discreet. Yeah, it's quite endearing. Actually, it is. So why don't we change the subject? - Are you all right? - Yeah. No, I'm fine. So Sara tells me that you're a consultant, Hitch. Yeah, mostly marketing, little advertising, brand management. I have no idea what that means. No one does. That's why I get to charge so much. Are you sure you're all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Is it itchy in here or is it just me? - I know what's happening. - No. You think that I'm in a stressful state... because I'm trying to make a good impression... while also dealing with my commitment issues... trying to avoid all these awkward conversations. No, I think you have food allergies. - Wow. - What? - Benadryl. Where's the Benadryl? - Aisle 2. - Which one's Aisle 2? - The one with the big 2 over it. Sara, I'm fine. - You sure it's in Aisle 2? - No. Really, it is not that serious. Benadryl. - A lot of Benadryl. A lot. - What? Are you... Coquille St. Jacques. Death on a leaf! Come on! Okay, we're doing fine. Just a couple more blocks and you get to lie down. Wait, who sings that song again? Oh, girl. Earth, Wind & Fire. You should let them sing it. I bet this would be great on the rocks. It's good, right? I bet I can ask you just about anything right now. No. I'm a vault, baby. Locked down. What is an heiress doing with a CPA? They're going to the Knicks game. Yep, Fort Knox. He loves her so much! I'm sure he does. I'm telling you, people search their whole lives trying to find the... Reasons that we're here I wouldn't know. You would if you saw it. Sometimes it's really hard to see the forest through the sleaze. What about you? You ever been in love? Yep. But you're never gonna know that. Okay, I think you've had enough of the juice box. Let's go. This is some place. You live here alone? Yeah. I actually prefer it that way. What about you? I haven't had a roommate since college, and he upped and married my sister. - Really? - Yeah, they're gonna have a baby soon. Uncle Hitch. Thank you. - So, how do you feel? - Good. Relaxed. So what about you? Any siblings? Sister. Maria. Lives in D.C. Younger, right? I could hear it in your voice. Sort of an innate protective thing. Yeah, I guess. What? She almost died once. I was 10. We were skating on the pond behind our house... and she fell through the ice. My dad pulled her out. Gave her mouth-to-mouth. Longest three minutes of my life. Yeah, I'm sure. I don't think I've ever really gotten over it. Kind of defines you, doesn't it? You know like, one moment you're gliding along... the next moment you're standing in the rain watching your life fall apart. Except it was snow. Yeah. That's what I said, ""snow."" You said ""rain."" Some kind of precipitation. Is that what happened to you? Nothing as dramatic as falling through the ice. You know... it definitely... Left a scar? Yeah. I guess it's best just not to love at all, right? Or skate. Are you here? Sara, you're such an idiot! You moron! What the hell did you think? You're so stupid! You gotta learn, Sara. - When are you gonna learn... - Should I come back later? Hi. I thought you left. Well, I did, but then I came back with breakfast. I figured it was the least that I could do. I didn't know what you were drinking... so I got a grande cap, a latte, an Earl Grey tea... and something with ""chai"" in the title. Tea for me. Tea. Yes! I was hoping you'd say that. Oh, God. You're a morning person, aren't you? Well, like I always tell my clients: Begin each day as if it were on purpose. - Wow. Beautiful day. - Yeah. - Beautiful girl. - Thank you. Well, I'm this way. I'm that way. Give me a ring sometime. I mean, on the phone. No, I definitely will. Good. I gotta go to work. Bye. Goodbye. Can you believe what a beautiful day it is... not? - What's wrong, pumpkin? - I'm so stupid. I ignored your advice. I went on that date. With who? Not the lingerie guy. Vance Munson. And you're right, there's no way he ever had a mother. That bad? He took me to Scalinatella, and he was affectionate and sweet. He told me all these intimate things, like how he can't taste food... and he wants three kids. So you slept with him. I never seen anybody get dressed that fast. Case, I'm so sorry. - Maybe I'll just die alone after all. - No, you won't. You'll meet a great guy with a great smile and you'll travel the world together. Who are you? Where's my best friend? It's true. He just hasn't found you yet. But he will. Just as he's leaving, guess what he says: ""Date Doctor, my ass."" - What does that mean? - It means he's really out there. And if I ever meet him, the only date he's gonna need is with a real doctor. That's him. Vance, is that you? Yeah, hey there, beautiful. Sara Melas, from the Standard. I'd like to discuss the dating consultant you hired... before you went out with Casey Sedgewick. You don't wanna talk, that's fine. I'm going to write this anyway. You just earned yourself a photo with a boldface caption. What? Nice. I can only imagine how the trading floor guys will react when they see this. You have no proof, no facts. Vance, I'm a gossip columnist, not the DA. Okay, how much will it cost me to stay out of this? I don't want money. I want a name. - I don't know his name. - Well, what do you know? I know this. All this for a lousy lay. Are we satisfied? Almost. No, you... You got to be... Is this really necessary? Have you seen your back? No, but I see my front and maybe we should be starting with some sit-ups. God! Mother of Troy! Hello? That's crazy. Just hearing your voice makes me smile. How are you? I'm good, I think. No, actually, you know what? I feel a little strange. I'm good. Sweet Georgia Brown! What was that? No, that's just some guy screaming. Listen, is there any context... under which you'd consider facial edema and pharmaceutical intervention a date? Probably not. How about a do-over? - What do you have in mind? - Dinner, my place. Because obviously going anywhere public with you is out of the question. God! That's it. I don't like you very much. What is that? Wait, I'm getting up. It's like one of those makeover shows. - That's a makeover show? - It's Danish. Almost done! Friday? Can't. I told a friend I'd go speed dating. You know, for moral support. But tomorrow I'm free. Great. All right, 8:00? Great. - All right. Bye-bye. - Bye. - See, it wasn't so bad, was it? - God! Ball is back in play after a 20-second timeout. Knicks lead the Grizzlies, 12-6, here early in the first quarter. - So this is what this feels like? - ""This"" being? Great seats, great game. Great date. I mean, sort of. To me, it feels like a... - Date? - Yeah. Look at her. She looks so happy. How does a guy like that end up with a girl like her? I am so jealous. I've always wanted to be able to do that. Really? Tonight is your lucky night. Let's see what you got. Okay. You ready? - Oh, God. I'm sorry. - It's fine. Knicks off to a great start... All right, here's how it works. Central Park Zoo, tomorrow, noon, by the sea lions. No, don't worry. I'll find you. All right. Thank you. It's all right. I'm sorry. Damn me. That was it! You got it. Do it again. Look how cute they are. Thanks. I had a great time tonight, Albert. I had a great time, too, Allegra. Good night. Good night, Albert. - Allegra. - Yes? Hold on. I like your lips. They seem to like you, too. Good night. Good night. - Anything? - Not yet. But I got some great shots of you biting your nails. Well, it's a big story. - Incoming. - Really? Yep. They're shaking hands. This is so great. I can't wait to nail this guy. Make sure you get a good shot of his face. - What's he look like? - Tall, dark, and handsome. Basic principles: No matter what, no matter who, no matter when. This is killing me. Geoff is managing to play it straight. How long have you been in love with her? Her? About two-and-a-half years. Take a look. - How'd you get my card? - Albert Brennaman. - Great guy, isn't he? - Excellent guy. What? Sara. - Pleasure to meet you, Geoff. - Hey, what... - How'd you get my card? - Albert Brennaman. - Great guy, isn't he? - Excellent guy. You sure you want to do this? Why wouldn't I? Louise made an interesting observation on the way home the other night. She said people who are guarded are afraid... that you can see right through them. That's why they hide behind layers of secrecy or humor. He'll have to hide behind a lot more than that once this hits the fan. She meant you. What do you want me to say? That I like the guy? Yeah, sure, I liked the guy. Well, here's his shirt. - Why don't you think about it? Call me. - Thanks. Papi, Sara Melas is here to see you. Thanks a lot, Raoul. Send her up. And stop calling me papi. Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes. I believe this belongs to you. Yeah, this thing is like a bad penny. Wow! So this is it. Yeah, this is it. Business must be good. Well, it has its rewards. I'll bet. Tough day? You could say that. Well, you know what? You can just sit back and relax. I got this all covered. Spanish wine! How thoughtful are we? - Here, let me pour that for you. - No, that's okay. - You want some? - Sure. So, Hitch. Is that a noun or a verb? I guess it depends. Let's see, what should we toast to? Never lie, steal, cheat, or drink. But if you must lie, lie in the arms of the one you love. If you must steal, steal away from bad company. If you must cheat, cheat death. And if you must drink... drink in the moments that take your breath away. Did you just make that up? Make yourself at home. I'm gonna check on the risotto. Look at this! Which one's the music? It does lights, too? Let me help you out with that. Now, this is nifty. What are you doing? How does it work, exactly? Well, usually you have dinner, then you have dessert. No, I mean your thriving business. I don't do interviews. But if you'd like to get back to the evening, I'd be happy to sit and talk. Great idea. You start. Well, maybe I would if you weren't snarling. What if I told you... that I know exactly what you do and how you do it? And I think it's despicable! You know what? We might need to go out to dinner. There's a great seafood restaurant I'd love to take you to. How about you just get a cleaver, butcher? - Maybe I will! - What the hell is wrong with you? Nothing a front-page story can't cure. So that's what this is all about? Albert and Allegra on the front of your crap-ass newspaper? - You put them there! - No, you did! No, he did! The minute he called you! Dr. Hitch. Listen to me, papi. I need to bring my partner, Amir, somewhere amazing for our anniversary. Maybe it's not your thing, but maybe it is. What the hell are you talking about, Raoul? It's you, no? So, my friend, how was she? Pretty good? How was she? I'll tell you! She was great! Isn't that the Date Doctor? - I'm telling you, that's him. - He doesn't look anything like him. - Excuse me. Do you know him? - No. I want you to look me in the eye and tell me that he did not hire you. Ma'am, I have never seen this man before in my life. See you later, Tony. Tony? You have got some serious explaining to do. Albert. Hitch. You all right? I can't really talk right now. I'm kind of tied up. One, two. On three. Women will remain seated. Men will rotate to the left at the buzzer. You get two minutes each, four minutes total. So trade your talk time when you hear... the gong. If it's mutual, you get numbers. If not, better luck next time, okay? Ladies, take your seats. Case, you are a living testimonial to the triumph of hope over experience. Thanks for coming. I know it's lame. I'm sure it's the last thing you feel like doing. I really prefer Rachmaninoff to the heavier romantic composers. But despite the pan-Germanic anti-Semitism... I'd still have to say my favorite is Wagner. - Nice talking to you. - Thank you. Bye. Bye. Excuse me. That's my seat, man. My name is Ron. I'm 28. Albert Brennaman is a good man. In fact, Albert Brennaman is a great man. I just got out of a five-year relationship. I'm a lot of fun at parties. I like dogs... And then you're mad at me for what I do for a living? I've already got your number... so why don't you go consult your conscience? - Albert is in love with her. - Just like Sebastian? - Is there a problem? - No, just one sec. - What do you have against Allegra anyway? - Nothing. My interest is protecting women from assholes like you. I did ice climbing once. - You don't even know me. - And whose fault is that? ...the sun comes up, the ice really starts to fall apart. I bet. I'm sorry. - Do you know this guy? - Apparently not. You're in my seat. You really... I'm doing you a favor, believe me. Basically, I like outdoor sports. But indoor sports have their place, too. There are certain aspects of my job that are secretive. And my job is to try to find the truth. The truth? You wouldn't know the truth if it kicked you in the head. If Albert Brennaman has to take a fall for it, so be it. Why don't you say what's really pissing you off? I've been waiting to talk to her... - You want to sit down? Here you go. Gong! - Thank you. Excuse me. Hi. Actually, you're not supposed to move. I'm Alex Hitchens. No, it's okay. Go. - I'm Casey. - Hi, Casey. I work for a small publishing house in the press department... which isn't actually where I want to be. But it's a good house... You handled me. You manipulated me. You researched me and you showed me my great-grandfather's signature. Wait. You're Ellis Island? - I thought that was real sweet. - Thank you. Case, you're not helping. Excuse me, I'm on a date. Does it ever occur to women that maybe a guy might like to have a plan... because he's nervous? He's not sure that he could just walk up to you and you'd respond if he said: ""I like you."" - That sounds good to me. - True, you can't tell them you like them. - I tried that. It didn't go well. - I've crashed and burned on that. That is what you did, and I did like you! I just didn't know I was being worked over by some professional. He doesn't have a badge. The only time he was sincere or spontaneous... was when everything was going wrong or when you were stoned out of your head. - I'm sorry to interrupt. Do I know you? - No, I don't think so. - You wanna see me be spontaneous? - Sure, you want a Benadryl? This is really kind of distracting. And I haven't gotten laid in a year! We're sorry. Why don't you guys get back to your date? Or go somewhere. Maybe from the bank? If this doesn't work out, call him. He might hook you up with Paris Hilton. Wait, that's it. You're the Date Doctor, right? - You're the Date Doctor? - Do we have a problem here? Yeah, a big one! What the hell did I ever do to you? Am I missing something? Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Why don't you go hit a titty bar with your buddy Vance? Wow. I don't believe this. That's your source? You buried yourself, Alex. Then you weren't listening. I heard every word. You're a scam artist. - You trick women into getting... - Into getting out of their own way... so great guys like Albert Brennaman have a fighting chance. No, I want everybody to take a good look at this right now. Because this right here... this is exactly why falling in love is so goddamn hard. Sir, let's go. Now. And Vance Munson is a pig! And I refused to work with him. You need to get your facts right. It's because of jerks like him that I even have a job. Had a job. Can you believe that guy? Actually, I do. You... complete me. - I might just have... - Shut up. Just shut up. You had me at ""hello."" No comment. This is off the record. I came to apologize. I made some assumptions about you... based on nothing, it turns out. - I guess Casey's right. My best friend... - Don't worry about it. We're straight. I should've asked you. But sometimes you're so guarded. I just don't wanna be another reason for you to... I'm not someone who likes to get involved past a certain point. And that point was about a week ago. Well, I just want to say I'm really sorry... and I didn't mean to hurt you. You didn't. That's a relief. - Hey, fella. - Yeah, good. You? What you got there? This? I figured maybe if my heart stops beating, it wouldn't hurt so much. She hasn't called back? You want some coffee? I want you to fix it. I got nothing, Albert. You wanna do something? We should get out tonight. Honestly, I never knew I could feel like this. I swear I'm going out of my mind. I wanna throw myself off of every building in New York. I see a cab and I wanna dive in front of it, because then I'll stop thinking about her. Look, you will. Just give it time. That's just it. I don't want to. I've waited my whole life to feel this miserable. If this is the only way I can stay connected with her... then this is who I have to be. No, you don't. You can change, you can adapt. You can make it so you don't ever have to feel like this. Ever again. Oh, my God. You just don't get it, do you? I get it. Let me get this straight. You're selling this stuff, but you don't believe in your own product. - Love is my life. - No. Love is your job. You wanna jump out a plane without a chute, be my guest. But forgive me if I don't join you. This isn't about love for you at all, is it? This whole time, I thought I was the coward. - Where you going? - Skydiving. Taxi! Mr. Hitchens. Miss Cole, thank you very much for seeing me. You said it was a matter of life and death. That man would've sold his soul to make you happy. So what does that make you, the devil? My job is not to deceive, Miss Cole. It's to create opportunities. Like the boardroom. - Would you have noticed him otherwise? - Yes. - Really? - Eventually. Maybe. How did you know all that stuff about me? Well, you really did your homework. Like at boarding school when everyone used to tease me because I couldn't whistle. And having him dance like a buffoon knowing that I can't dance, either. Then telling him to drop mustard on his shirt, so I'd feel less like a dork. That was all you, right? No. Hell, no. That was him? That's got Albert written all over it. Did you put him up to the inhaler? Stop it. He did not show you that. He chucked it right before he kissed me. So, wait... that stuff worked for you? It was adorable. What did you do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. That's good. - This was your plan the whole time? - Albert. You sail off into the sunset with my girl? You were like a brother to me! - He came here for you. - Who? The guy you're choking. - I love you. - I love you. I really love you. - I love you more. - I love you more. I really do. I got somewhere I gotta go. - Yeah, who is it? - Hitch. Can I talk to you? What? You almost hit me. Look, I just wanted to stop by, basically. See, this is the thing. This is weird. I don't have me behind the door, you know. Close your mouth. Because I knew at some point I'd be... right here. But I thought that... everything would come out, but it's like... That's throwing me off. - Can we close the door? - What? I'm sorry. Just, can we... I just need... - Are you serious? - No, just like this. What do you want, Hitch? You. For a whole lot of reasons that don't make any sense to me. I mean, what, we've been on three dates? See, that's what's crazy. That's what's crazy, because I know. I know deep... like just down, just in this area... that I just know... that I want... I want to be miserable. Like, really miserable. Because, hey... if that's what it takes for me to be happy then... Wait, that didn't come out right. What the hell is wrong with you? - Nothing! - No, not you. I'm talking to me. Alex Hitchens, Tom Reda. I'll just put this in the car. Maybe it's like what you said. We should just both go our separate ways and then we'll do just fine. What if fine isn't good enough? What if I want extraordinary? No such thing. I'm just as scared as you are, Sara. But I'm right here, and our time is right now. Well, what about before? I am a guy. Since when do we get anything right the first time? I'm a realist, and I know what love does to people. - No, you don't. - Keys. There you go. Right here. I don't know who this is, and I don't care. What I do know is he'll never feel about you the way that I do. - You know how to drive a stick? - Both of you, shut up! - You okay? - Yeah. No, I'm fine. You'll never be fine, and neither will I! Maybe I should drive. Are you trying to get yourself killed? If that's what it takes. Sara, what happened? - He jumped on the car. - Why? Because that's what people do. They leap and hope to God they can fly. Because otherwise... we just drop like a rock... wondering the whole way down: ""Why in the hell did I jump?"" But here I am, Sara, falling. And there's only one person that makes me feel like I can fly. That's you. So, you kind of like me? No. I love you. I love you, and I knew it from the first... If I say it back now, it'll sound so stupid. This is the guy I was telling you about. Hitch, that's my sister, Maria. And that's her husband, Tom. Her husband. Where's your date? Don't have one. I know. Shocking, huh? Oh, my God! Are you all right? Grandma, what happened? This young lady just saved my life. Ask her to dance. Well, if you insist. - I'm Casey. - Charles Wellington. - And this... - Forget it. Just go. Basic principles: There are none., You see how it's done? Yeah, I think I got the hang of it. You better. The boss will chew my head off if these cores get messed up. Don't worry. We're at 26 feet. You let Jason operate the drill? Yeah, he can handle it. I didn't do anything. Give me your hand! Let go of the drill! Forget it, Jack! It's too late! You're not gonna make it! Jack! Jack! Give me your hand! I've got you! What were you thinking? - What's happening? - The whole damn shelf is breaking off! That's what's happening! What we have found locked to these ice cores is evidence of a cataclysmic climate shift that occurred around 10,000 years ago. The concentration of these natural greenhouse gases in the ice cores indicates that runaway warming pushed the planet into an ice age which lasted two centuries. I'm confused. I thought you were talking about global warming, not an ice age. Yes, it is a paradox, but global warming can trigger a cooling trend. Let me explain. The northern hemisphere owes its temperate climate to the North Atlantic current. Heat from the sun arrives at the equator and is carried north by the ocean. But, global warming is melting the polar ice caps and disrupting this flow. Eventually it will shut down. And when that occurs... there goes our warm climate. Excuse me. When do you think this could happen, professor? When? I don't know. Maybe in 100 years, maybe in 1000. But what I do know is that if we do not act soon, it is our children and our grandchildren who will have to pay the price. And who's going to pay the price of the Kyoto Accord? It will cost the world's economy hundreds of billions of dollars. With all due respect, Mr. Vice President, the cost of doing nothing could be even higher. Our climate is fragile. At the rate we're burning fossil fuels and polluting the environment, the ice caps will soon disappear. Professor, um, Hall... our economy is every bit as fragile as the environment. Perhaps you should keep that in mind before making sensationalist claims. Well, the last chunk of ice that broke off was about the size of the state of Rhode Island. Some people might call that pretty sensational. Stop global warming! Stop global warming! I'm here at the global warming conference in New Delhi, where, if you can believe your eyes, it's snowing. The coldest weather on record has thrown the city into chaos, with hundreds of homeless people freezing to death. Taxi! I enjoyed your testimony, professor. It was very spirited. Oh, thank you. That's what we're here for, right? Put on a good show? Quite. I was wondering if I could talk to you about your theory on abrupt climate shift. The name's Rapson. Terry Rapson. Professor Rapson? - Of the Hedland Center? - That's me. I've read your work on ocean currents. - What do you say to a spot of tea? - Absolutely. If we can hail a cab. Over here. Welcome back to Glasgow, Scotland, where Manchester United leads 3-1 over hometown Celtic. in this pitiful Champions League match. We return to the action 63 minutes into the second half as Manchester United looks to put the game out of reach. Let's get back to our commentator Donald MacFarland. What? Yeah. - I just closed my eyes for a sec, man. - Yeah. The baby kept us awake all night. And still. Good! Dennis? NOMAD buoy 4311 is showing a temperature drop of 13 degrees. - Yeah? Where is 4311? - Well, it's... - Georges Bank. - It's rough seas out there. Must have knocked it about. Kick that bloody ball. Come on! Come on, kick it now. Kick it! - Kick it! - Are the lads winning? Hello, professor. How was India? Oh, you know what these scientific gatherings are. All dancing girls, wine and parties. The fury of Hurricane Noelani stunned weather experts yesterday slamming into the unprepared island chain with a cataclysmic force never before witnessed. Meteorologists already believe this to be the strongest hurricane ever recorded. Are you gonna get that? Hello? I just saw that Sam got an F in calculus. I'm aware, Jack. I get a copy of his report card too. Sam is a straight-A student. He doesn't fail classes. All right, I don't have time to talk about this right now. Well, maybe you ought to make time. Excuse me, I'm not the one who's away for months and months at a time. I just don't understand. I'll let him explain it to you. Can you take him to the airport in the morning? Sam's getting on a plane? He joined the Scholastic Decathlon Team. - They're competing in New York. - Sam joined a team? - Yeah, I think there's a girl involved. - Oh. Look, can you pick him up at 8:30? I gotta go because I'm on call tonight. Jack, please don't be late. I don't want him taking a taxi again. All right. Okay. I'll be there. Okay? I'll be there. This morning's weather staff meeting has been moved to level four, conference room B. Jack? I know you have an innate talent for rubbing people the wrong way Jack, but why? Why, for the love of god, would you aggravate the vice president? Because my 17-year-old kid knows more science than he does. Perhaps. But your 17-year-old kid does not control our budget. - It doesn't matter if he hates you. - My son doesn't hate me. You're missing the point. What I'm trying to tell you is, - if Raymond Becker pulls our budget... - Oh, shit! - Wait... Will you...? Jack. Oh, my god. - Hi Sam. I'm sorry I'm late. - Dad, it's fine. The cab's already here. That's okay. I'll take care of it. - What are you gonna...? - Here you go. I'm not angry. I'm disappointed. - Do you want to hear my side of it? - Sam, how can there be two sides? Hey look. I got every question right on the final. And the only reason why Mr. Spengler failed me was because I didn't write out the solutions. Why not? I do them in my head. - Did you tell him that? - I did. He didn't believe me. He said that if he can't do them in his head, then I must be cheating. Oh, that's ridiculous. How can he fail you for being smarter than he is? That's what I said. You did? - How'd he take it? - He flunked me, remember? Oh, yeah. Sam, I'm sorry. I jumped to conclusions. I'm gonna call this guy and have a word with him. We're gonna get this whole thing straighten out. Hey, you can't park there. - Don't worry about it. - Sam? Sam. Parker, this is Houston. We're seeing some bad weather over Canaveral. It doesn't look like you're coming back this week. Your wife's gonna give me an earful. Roger that. Hey, come take a look at this storm system. It's enormous. You all right? He's afraid of flying. I'm fine. You know statistically, the chance of a plane going down because of turbulence is less than, what, one in a billion? Or is it a million? - I can't remember if it's a... - Shut up, Brian. Listen, Sam... don't pay attention to him, okay? Everything's fine. They're still serving drinks. Hey folks, it appears we're gonna have a little bit of a bumpy ride here for the next few minutes. Please fasten your seat belts and put your tray tables and seatbacks in their upright positions until we get through this. Thank you. Grab it. Watch out! Sam? Sam. Can I have my hand back? I can't believe I'm spending two weeks alone with my mom. Be patient with her. She's been looking forward to this holiday for months. I know. I love you. I love you too. Hey. Hey, hello. Bye-bye. The cause of this extreme weather remains a mystery, although some meteorologists believe sunspots are to blame. Hundreds are missing... This is very odd. There's a buoy here registering a 13-degree drop in ocean temperature. Oh, yeah, that's right. That buoy malfunctioned the other day. I'll put a call in, see if there are any ships near Georges Bank to get it. This buoy isn't in Georges Bank. It's just off Greenland. What? What are the odds of two buoys failing? Remote. Make that three. Just another typical day in New York City. Traffic jam, 10 blocks long. Lookie here, Buddha. These people, and their cars, and their exhaust and they're just polluting the atmosphere. Excuse me, sir. We're really late. We're almost there. - We're only two blocks away. - Let's walk. What's gotten into them? I have no idea. They're all worked up today. In 1532, Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro defeated this Incan emperor at the Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca. What is his name? Time. Montezuma. No, no, Montezuma was in Mexico, not Peru. It's, like, Anta-something. - Atahualpa? - That's it! Time's up. Correct answers, please. That's five points for Woodmont and five points for Pinehurst Academy. Next question. In what year did Louis Quatorze ascend to the throne of France? This place is so retro, it might actually be cool if it were on purpose. Yeah, look at all these nerds. Hey. Hey. You look beautiful. Thanks. This place is incredible. Do you believe that this is their cafeteria? You played a great first round. So did you. These are my teammates, Sam and Brian. - I'm Laura. - Oh, I'm J.D. - Your school's amazing. - Would you like... would you like a tour? Sure. That'd be great. Could you hold this for a sec? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Man, you got some serious competition. Please. - I bet he's really rich too. - Shut up. Who is it? Terry Rapson here. Sorry to call you so early. No, professor, it's all right. What is it? Well, we've found something extraordinary. Extraordinary and disturbing, that is. You recall what you said in New Delhi about how polar melting might disrupt the North Atlantic Current? Yes. Well... I think it's happening. What do you mean? One of our NOMAD buoys registered a 13-degree drop in surface temperature the other day. I've sent you an e-mail. Hold on. At first we thought it was a malfunction. But there are four more across the North Atlantic  showing the same thing. This is unbelievable. You predicted it would happen. Yes, but not in our lifetime. This is too fast. There are no forecast models remotely capable of plotting this scenario, except yours. My model is a reconstruction of a prehistoric climate shift. It's not a forecast model. It's the closest thing we have. Nothing like this has ever happened before. At least not in the last 10,000 years. As I predicted yesterday, the swell off Hurricane Noelani is incredible. These waves are even bigger than I imagined. Just take a look. Shouldn't you be monitoring the weather or something? This is L.A. What weather? Wait. What's that noise? What noise? Honey, I'll be right back. The Coast Guard has closed the beaches, as waves have grown too big for... L.A. Weather Center. It's Tommy. I'm down at the beach. I'm in the middle of something, Tommy. What do you need? There's hail the size of golf balls coming down here. A low-pressure system moving along the California coastline is creating a cyclonic system across the L.A. Basin. Yeah? Hello? Hey boss, turn on The Weather Channel right away. I think we have to issue a tornado warning. What are you talking about? Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting wind speeds in excess of 70 miles... Hold on a second. ...conditions that are highly unusual for California. Tom, we're building a forecast model, we're gonna need... what? Priority access to the mainframe for two days, maybe three. - Oh, is that it? Anything else? - We need it immediately. You know I would say that you've lost your mind but you've been this way for the past 20 years. Tom, this is important. What's this forecast model you're building, if you don't mind my asking? Janet Tokada, this is Jack Hall. Janet's a hurricane specialist with NASA. Jack's a paleoclimatologist, and I have absolutely no idea what he's up to. Booker. What's going on here? They just issued a tornado warning in Los Angeles. Breaking news as we prepare to go live to Los Angeles. - Mixed reports are coming in about... - Report is just coming out. some extreme weather occurring in the area. Okay, we're now going live to our Fox affiliate in Los Angeles. We have live coverage now from our Fox 11 chopper. Are you there, Bart? Uh, yes, I'm here. These tornados are forming so fast... - Bart! - What? Oh! Oh, my god. Lisa, are you getting this on camera? This tornado just came and erased the Hollywood sign. The Hollywood sign is gone. It's just shredded. Bart, what can you see? Is anyone hurt? I wouldn't be surprised. There is so much damage down there. And there are people down there, taking pictures. Hey, what the hell are you guys doing? Go for cover! You can't stay here! Get out of here! What you're seeing are two actual tornados striking Los Angeles International Airport. Wait. Wait. It looks like they've joined and formed one large tornado. - Tommy! - Oh, my god! Holy shit! I'd like to urge all of our viewers to stay away from the areas... - Jeff, where are you? - I'm on Yucca and Vine. - I'm on my way there now. - You're on TV. Right in the middle of it. God! Oh, my god! You gotta get out of there, man. That bus just got dropped on top of that Porsche! Oh, my god. I hope no one was in that car. For our national audience just joining us now we are going live to downtown Los Angeles right now. Tommy? If you look over there behind me, that's a tornado. Yes, a twister in Los Angeles. It's one of many tornados that are destroying our city. There's another one. That's the Los Angeles skyline. It's unbelievable! It's huge! I've never seen anything like it. What's happening? It- it- it looks like some sort of huge, horrific, terrifying nightmare, only this is the real thing... Yes, I'm looking at it right now. - Yes, it is. - What's happening Raymond? I'll call you back. Mr. President, Los Angeles has been devastated by a series of tornados. On top of that, the FAA wants your approval to suspend all air traffic. What do you think we should do? Until we can figure it out what's going on here I... I don't think we have much choice, sir. What you're seeing is what's left of downtown Los Angeles. Hey, man, I just got off the phone with my mom. Excuse me, you guys. I'm really sorry, but we need to change the channel. The FAA has grounded all air traffic in the United States. Unfortunately, the order came too late for two planes that were brought down by severe turbulence in the Midwest. - The first flight... - So much for ""one in a billion."" All right. All right, listen up, everybody. Listen up, please. We've got a lot of work to do, and we don't have much time so let's get started, please. Vorsteen? All our grid models are worthless. I don't think grid models are gonna be a lot of help here. The Canadians are reporting tremendous circulation moving down from the Arctic. In Siberia, there's a low-pressure system unlike anything we've seen, and Australia just saw the strongest typhoon ever recorded. Hang on. Are you saying that these things are interconnected? We have to consider the possibility. The only force strong enough to affect global weather is the sun. - What's NASA have to say? - We've already checked. Solar output is normal. What about the North Atlantic Current? What about it? I got a call last night... from Professor Rapson at the Hedland Center. He thinks the current has changed. Oh, come on, Jack. How could that be? The current depends upon a delicate balance of salt and freshwater. - We all know that. - Yes. But no one has taken into account how much freshwater has been dumped into the ocean because of melting polar ice. I think we've hit a critical desalinization point. It would explain what's driving this extreme weather. Hedland had some pretty convincing data. They've asked me to feed it into my paleoclimate model to track the next set of events. Hold on Jack. Are you suggesting these weather anomalies are gonna continue? Not just continue. Get worse. I think we're on the verge of a major climate shift. Tom. What are you gonna tell the Administration? What do you expect me to tell them? The government has to start making long term preparations, now. Jack, all you have is a theory. Well, then give me the mainframe. And let me prove it. No. You have 48 hours. - Professor Hall. - Yes. - I think your theory may be correct. - Walk with me. Just a few weeks ago, I monitored the strongest hurricane on record. The hail, the tornados, it all fits. Can the model you're working on factoring in storm scenarios? - We haven't had the time. - Well, maybe I can help. - Welcome aboard. - Thanks. Hi, I'm Jason. Hi. Do you have the results of Peter's CT scan? Yeah. The treatments shrunk the tumor 20 percent. - Is his eyesight better today? - No. No change. - Hi, Peter. How are you doing today? - A little better. Good. Let me listen here. Can you read that? No, but I remember the story from the pictures. You do? My mother used to read it to me. She must be very proud of you. You've been such a brave, big boy. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Here you go. - Thank you. Jack, you've been working for 24 hours straight. You're the only one who hasn't taken a break. Maybe I'll try to shut my eyes for a while. Call me when you get the results. Frank, is he always so obsessive? - Yeah. - Yes. Does he ever lighten up? - Not really. - No. How long have you been working together? Well, Frank's been working with him since the Stone Age, but I've only had to endure two years of servitude. Jack. Jack, we got the results. Six to eight months? That can't be. That time scale isn't in months. It's in weeks. Widespread flooding has slowed transportation and caused numerous closures, including the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels. The plumbing in the school is really old. And I guess seeing with all this rain, the sewage got stopped up. Where are you staying tonight? They're finding a place for us to stay with kids here in New York City. Are you sure you can't get home any sooner than tomorrow? Well, look, dad, I would if I could, you know. I just... This smell is unbearable, dad. Stop kidding around! I want you home. Dad, I'll be on the train. Do me a favor okay. Just don't worry about me. I'll figure it out. All right, son. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey, Sam, guess what? We got a place to stay. Great. So far, the terrible weather hasn't hit D.C. area, but local residents aren't taking any chances as people stock up for what is already being billed as the worst storm season on record. You better be sure about this Jack. - My ass is on the line. - You saw the model. And I hope to god it's wrong. - Mr. Vice President. - Tom. - You know Professor Hall. - Yes, we've met. Professor Hall has some new information I think you should take a look at it. We just got these results from our simulation model. They explain what's causing this severe weather. Look, I have to read this later. I have a meeting with the director of FEMA right now. This is very urgent sir. Our climate is changing violently. And it's going to happen over the next six to eight weeks. I bet you said this wouldn't happen for another 100 years or so. - I was wrong. - Well, suppose you're wrong this time. I wish that I were, but I'm sure that you're aware of what's happening all around the world. We're making all the necessary preparations for this storm. What more do you expect? You have to start thinking about large-scale evacuations right now. Especially in the Northern states. - Evacuations? - Yes. Have you lost your mind, Hall? I have to go. Mr. Vice President! If we don't act now, it's going to be too late. Come on, Jack. Hey. Thanks for bringing us here. I couldn't let you leave New York without seeing the Natural History Museum. Of course not. It's the world's finest collection of stuffed animals. Hey, guys, check this out. ""The body of this mammoth was found perfectly preserved in the Siberian tundra with food still in its mouth and stomach indicating that it froze instantly while grazing."" It's been 24 hours now since the snow started falling across the British Isles and over Northern Europe. It shows no signs of letting up. No, no, no. You've got to stop worrying. No, no. It's fine. We've got plenty of supplies. We're just snowed in. Yeah. No, it's all right. It's all right. No, you stay where you are. I'll be fine. Yeah, I love you too. Okay, bye. - Hey. How's Jeanette? - Oh, fine. The ferry just landed. Must be nice in Spain. Wish I was there. An elite RAF search-and-rescue team has been deployed by helicopter to airlift the royal family to safety. Yeah, you think they'll come get us since we got snowed in? Not likely. Luckily we've got our own genny, enough tea and biscuits to sink a ship. Oh, we'll be fine. As long as the loo doesn't back up again. We've got zero visibility. - Maintain heading and speed. - What's our heading? 035, sir. Approximately 40 kilometers from Balmoral Castle. We've lost visual contact with you. - This gauge here can't be right. - Wind speed has dropped to zero. We have vertical walls of cirrus cloud formations. What the hell is going on? The bloody fuel lines are starting to freeze. Port engine pressure is dropping. The rotor rpm is dropping. We've got a flameout on the starboard side as well. Prepare for crash landing. Select emergency fuel. Come on, you bastard! Come on! What I'm about to tell you is supposed to be confidential. Several hours ago, three helicopters went down over Scotland. They crashed because the fuel in their lines froze. - At what temperature does...? - Negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit. We had to look it up. The temperature dropped phenomenally fast. On the ground, people froze before they could get out of their cars even. Can you get me a satellite picture of Scotland two hours ago? Yeah. We've got mountains of data but nowhere near enough computer power to analyze it. Can you help us? Send us what you got. We'll do our best. Thanks, Jack. Bye for now. This is Scotland at the time the temperature dropped. This thing looks just like a hurricane. Only hurricanes don't form over land. - Good evening, sir. - Hey, Harold. - Thanks, Victor. See you in the morning. - Right, sir. - Terrible weather. - Tell me about it. Wow. You live here? Just on the weekends. It's... It's my dad's place. He's kind of never around, so... Where is he? Skiing in Europe with my stepmom. Is this you and your brother? Yeah, that's when we took a bike trip together. It's been raining like this for three days now. Come on, hurry up. I'm just standing here. You can't stay here. I never liked this neighborhood anyway. It's a mob scene here at Grand Central Station. Over half the platforms are flooded and service has been suspended on all trains. With planes still grounded and trains now out of service that's bad news for the... Hey, Victor's coming to pick me up. You guys want a ride to the train station? Not anymore. In Nova Scotia earlier today the ocean rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds. What we have feared for the past few days has indeed happened. The cold front moving down from the Arctic has created an enormous storm system in Canada. Which, incredible as it sounds, looks more and more like a tropical hurricane... Well, I gotta go pick up my little brother. Do you guys want me to give you a ride? Where is he? He's in a boarding school in Philadelphia. If this system moves south we could see a wind-driven storm surge that could threaten the entire Eastern Seaboard. Okay, bye. Victor's stuck in traffic over on Fifth Avenue. It'll be easier to head straight out of town if we just meet him over there. All right. You mean walk? No, not in this. We should take the stairs. We're on the top floor. I guess we're walking. Maybe we should just stay here. I think the young lady is right sir. No. We need to get home. Hey, Cesar, come here. What are you doing? The wolves, they're gone. Just to give you an idea of the situation which seems to be becoming worse with each passing minute. At the moment, we have flooding in most parts of the island. We've got traffic snarl-ups because the electricity is now out to almost every part of Manhattan. No traffic signals. Car accidents, at least two hundred. And lower Manhattan, we've been told, is virtually inaccessible. Can you call Mom? Will you please phone her for me? Hey. That dog can't come in here. Come on, man. It's pouring out there. I don't care. Read the sign. It's supposed to be a public library. Come on, guys, this way. Excuse me. You're bad. Goddamn 1500-dollar waterproof raincoat. - Please, shut up, man. - There must be rats everywhere. That's because it's New York. Hey! Hey! - Open up, big papa. - It's out of service. It's out of service. No, no. I'll give you 100 dollars to put it in service. You don't have to do that. No, no, really. 200 dollars. I won't have it. I won't have it. Oh god, I love buses. This is so much fun. This is gonna be the bomb. Hello? I can't reach my driver. - I lost the signal. - This is insane. We're not gonna be able to drive anywhere. We should just go back to your apartment. Yeah, I vote for that. What? Are you kidding? We have to get higher! Come on. Up to the library. Calm down. I can't understand what you're saying. If you stay calm, ma'am, I'll get you out. The door is jammed! I don't speak French! Hey, where's Laura? - She was just right there. - She's right there! Right there, see? What is she doing? Tell them to cover their eyes. There is a wall of water coming towards New York City. Everybody... What? What's the problem? She left her bag in the cab. Their passports. Forget about it. - I'll get it for her. - Come on. Oh, my... Laura! Laura! - Sam. - No! Brian, no! Laura! Laura, look! Come on. Come! Come on! Sam! No! Professor. Thank you. - Is that Neville's handiwork? - Neville's way beyond stick figures. - He's 6 already. - Oh. No, this masterpiece belongs to my second grandson, David. God. I can't believe Neville's 6 already. You won't believe how fast they grow. Professor. I've got Jack Hall on the phone. They've run the data we've sent them. Here he is. Jack, were you able to recreate the thermal cycle? Yes. The storm's rotation is pulling super-cooled air all the way down from the upper troposphere. But shouldn't the air warm up before it reaches ground level? It should. But it doesn't. The air's descending too rapidly. Is this an isolated incident? I'm afraid not. We've located two other super cells in addition to the one over Scotland. There is one over Northern Canada and another one over Siberia. And do we know their projected paths? Yes. Our previous estimates of six to eight weeks weren't even close. This one storm is going to change the face of our planet. Here's a projection of 24 hours out. This is 48 hours out. And in seven to ten days... When this storm is over we'll be in a new Ice Age. My god. Professor... It's time you got out of there. I'm afraid that time has come and gone, my friend. What can we do? Save as many as you can. Jack. Something's happened in New York. No, the power is out. I've been in here all day. - Who needs help? - Here. Over here. What? This is the last one. Enjoy it. Greedy. All circuits are busy at this time. Listen, thanks for coming back for me. It was really brave. I guess I better return her bag. Sam? Just tell her how you feel. Yeah. Did you reach your little brother yet? No, there's still no service. Damn cell phones. - Excuse me. - Yes. Are there any pay phones on the upper floors? No, no, no. Ah. But there are some on the mezzanine. Great. - Oh, but I think it's underwater. - Where you going? Power's out. Older payphones draw their power directly from the telephone line. There will be an emergency meeting of all NOAA department heads... Oh, god. I've been trying to reach Sam. So have I. I tried to call you but I couldn't get through. It's been a madhouse around here. Come on. Are you sure about this? It works. I love that picture. Yeah, so do I. Where was that taken? Miami. Well, where was I? I don't remember that trip. Sam and I went with my sister. You were in Alaska, doing research on your doctorate. Remember what he was like when he was that age? Everything was ""one more."" One more bedtime story. One more ride on my shoulders. ""One more, daddy."" Jack. Sam's on the phone. Line four. - Sam? - Dad! Where are you? Are you all right? I'm all right. We're at the Public Library. Sam, it's Mom. - I'm so happy you're okay. - Mom. Can you call Laura and Brian's parents and tell them we're all right? Yes, of course. - Sam, what's that noise? - Sam? Sam? What is going on out there, dad? Sam. Sam, listen to me. Listen very carefully. Forget what I said about trying to head south. It's too late for that. The storm is just gonna get worse. It's gonna turn into a massive blizzard with an eye in the center of it, just like a huge hurricane. Uh huh. Only the air is gonna be so cold. You could freeze to death in seconds. Sam? Well, what should we do? Listen to me, son. Do not go outside. Just burn whatever you can to stay warm, and try to wait it out. I will come for you. Do you understand me? I will come for you. Sam? - Sam, come back! - Sam? - Sam? Sam, did you hear me? Did you hear me? Sam? - Tell me he's gonna be okay... - He's gonna be all right. He's gonna be all right, do you understand me? I thought you'd drowned. Let's find some dry clothes for you. Come on. Where'd you store the arctic gear? You can't make it to New York, Jack. I've walked that far before in the snow. This is not the same. Jack, this is not the same. Lucy, tell him. I have to do this. I know. My hands are shak... - Shaking. - That's okay. Here. Here. Come here. What are you doing? I'm using my body heat to warm you. If we let the blood from your arms and legs rush back to your heart too quickly your heart could fail. Where did you learn that? Some of us were actually paying attention in health class. How are you feeling? Much better. Frank told me about Sam. I'm not gonna try to talk you out of going, but there's something I need for you do first. You have to explain your results to the Administration. - I already tried that, Tom. - I know. This time will be different. You're gonna brief the President directly. - Is that the last of it? - Yeah. Pretty much. Okay. We also found this radio, but I don't think it works. Let me see it. Buddha, keep quiet. You ain't even supposed to be in here anyway. Come on, guys. Oh, my god. The basic rule of storms is that they continue until the imbalance that created them is corrected. In this case, we're talking about a global realignment. This superstorm will last seven to ten days. When it's over, ice and snow will cover the entire Northern Hemisphere. The ice and snow will reflect sunlight. The Earth's atmosphere will restabilize but with an average temperature close to that of the last Ice Age. Well, what can we do about this? Head as far south as possible. That is not amusing, professor. Where do you suggest they go? The farther south they go, the safer they'll be. Texas. Parts of Florida that aren't flooded. Mexico would be best. Mexico? Maybe you should stick to science and leave policy to us. Well, we tried that approach. You didn't want to hear about the science when it could have made a difference. What exactly are you proposing, professor? Evacuate everyone south of that line. What about the people in the North? I'm afraid it's too late for them. If they go outside the storm will kill them. At this point their best chance is to stay inside. Try to ride it out. Pray. What do you think he'll do? I don't know. Jack. Thanks... and good luck. You too. We're all gonna need it. We can't evacuate half the country because one scientist thinks the climate is shifting. Every minute we delay is costing lives. What about the other half of the country? If Professor Hall is right about this storm pattern sending troops north will create more victims. We need to save the people we can right now. We take the same approach in triage on the battlefield. Sometimes it's necessary to make difficult choices... I don't accept that abandoning half the country is necessary. Maybe if you would've listened to him sooner, it wouldn't be. Bullshit. It's easy for him to suggest this plan. - He's safely here in Washington. - His son is in Manhattan. I just thought that you should know that before you start questioning his motives. We're going to follow Hall's plan. - General. - Sir? Give the order for the National Guard to evacuate the southern states. Yes, sir. Vivian... get me my wife. Sorry, mates, but we're just about out of petrol. Hey. Is there any chance... that it'll run... on this? Are you mad? That's a 12-year-old Scotch. Gentlemen. To England. To mankind. To Manchester United. I just... I just wish I could have seen him grow up. You know? The important thing is he will grow up. Amen. Maybe you should have somebody help you with that, you know. Sir, I am president of the Electronics Club the Math Club and the Chess Club. Now, if there's a bigger nerd in here, please, point him out. I'll just leave you alone to work on it, okay? Come on, Buddha, come on. Do your business. Look, there's nobody around. OK. You know what? I'll turn around. I won't look. I promise. What? Hey, man, there is people out there. I was walking my dog. There is hundreds of them. They're walking on the snow. Where they all going? They're getting out of the city before it's too late. All right, everybody. Quiet down. When was the last time anyone got a signal on a cell phone? Well, I got through to my cousin in Memphis an hour ago. They're being evacuated to the South. We should get moving too. The water is frozen over enough to walk on. We should get going before the snow gets too deep. Everyone, wrap yourselves up as fast as you can. - We shouldn't go. - We're leaving in five minutes. Why not, Sam? Everyone's leaving. When I talked to my dad, he told me to stay inside. The storm will kill anybody caught in it. - Then you have to say something. - I know. Excuse me, sir, you're making a mistake. What? Listen son, we're all scared, but we've got no choice. - That's not it. - Get ready to go. If these people go outside, they will freeze to death! Okay, what is this nonsense? It's not nonsense. All right? Look, this storm is gonna get worse. The people who are caught outside they will freeze to death. - Where are you getting this information? - My father's a climatologist. - He works for the government. - So what are you suggesting we do? We stay inside, we keep warm, and we wait it out. The snow is getting deeper by the minute. We'd be trapped here without food, supplies... - It's a risk, yeah... - An unnecessary risk. No, no. It's not. We've wasted enough time talking about this. Come on, people Let's go. - Look, look. Just look for a second. - Come on, everybody... - One second. - Let's get going. The storm is gonna get bad. It's gonna get really, really bad. You're not gonna be able to survive it. Believe me. Sir, please just stay. Just stay. Just don't... She's set to go. Come on, straight to the back, guys. It'll be impossible to reach each other. Leave a message for me at the American Embassy in Mexico City. Okay, I will. I love you. I love you, Jack. Tell Sam I love him so much. God be with you. - Doctor Hall? - Yeah. We haven't been able to reach Peter's parents. - I'm gonna try it later, okay? - Okay. Thank you. I got it. You're supposed to be on a bus heading south. I've been watching your back for 20 years. You think I'd let you go alone? All these years I thought I was watching your back. Where are the keys? In the truck. Where do you think you're going? Neither one of you knows how to navigate worth a damn. Without me, you'll end up in Cleveland. I'll try to give you updates on the storm as it heads your way. Good luck, Jack. Breaking news from the U.S.-Mexico border. Just half an hour ago, Mexican officials closed the border in the light of so many U.S. refugees who are fleeing south in the wake of the approaching storm. These people came here in anticipation of crossing into Mexico. Instead, they've been met with closed gates. And now, in a dramatic reversal of illegal immigration thousands of people are crossing the Rio Grande into Mexico. The scene that unfolding here behind me is one of desperation and frustration. People have abandoned their cars, grabbed their belongings and they are wading across the river illegally into Mexico. Here it is. This fireplace probably hasn't been used in about 100 years. All right. - What are you doing? - What did you think we're gonna burn? - You can't burn books. - No, absolutely not. You wanna freeze to death? I'll go get some more. I'll help you. I'm going with them. Okay, do you have a cafeteria or a lunchroom? Just an employees' lounge with a few vending machines. We're not gonna last very long on MandM's and potato chips. What about the garbage cans? There's always something to eat in the garbage. Friedrich Nietzsche? We can not burn Nietzsche. He was the most important thinker of the 19th century. Please. Nietzsche was a chauvinist pig who was in love with his sister. He was not a chauvinist pig. But he was in love with his sister. Excuse me? you guys? Yeah, there's a whole section on tax law down here that we can burn. After hours of uncertainty, the traffic is now moving smoothly from the United States into Mexico. This is only possible because the president was able to negotiate a deal to forgive all Latin American debt in exchange for opening the border. Now, multitudes of American families are feeling a rush of relief... Lucy? Is Peter's ambulance here? No. - Why? - They've all gone. - What? - In the confusion... I don't know what happened. People just started to panic, and they left, and... - God. - Now there's a policeman with a snowplow. - He's waiting outside. - God. Peter can't be moved in anything but an ambulance. I called and left a message for the county ambulance service. Okay. Okay, you should go, and I'll stay and wait. Lucy, no. - No. - No, you should go. He's not gonna wait forever. It's okay. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - All right. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I cut my leg the other day. Did you get a signal? Yeah, for a minute. And? Man, this storm is everywhere. It's hit the entire Northern Hemisphere. Europe is buried under 15 feet of snow and they say it's gonna get just as bad here. I mean, I don't think your dad's gonna make it. No, he'll make it. He'll make it. The White House has ordered the following national disaster alert for all Northern states. Continued exposure to the approaching storm is deadly. Remain indoors and take all measures to stay warm, burning any fuel sources until the storm is over.  The Roads are impassable across New York State as far south as Pennsylvania... Where are we? Looks like we're just north of Philadelphia. Look out! You guys okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. Once again, the roads across the... Sorry, boss. Unpack the snowshoes. We're walking from here. Come on, ma'am. Let's get up and get going. We've only made it to Brooklyn. Maybe we should just turn back. What for? Half the city's frozen under water. There's nothing to go back to. Time to get up and keep moving. What we should've done is stayed in the library. Come on, man. Okay, guys, let's get moving. Wake up. What are you doing? Insulating. Newspaper's best, but this'll do. You know, you spend some years on the streets and you learn how to keep warm. Hey. Thanks. I got one. Your favorite vacation. Besides this one? All right. I went to Greenland with my dad on one of his research trips a few years ago... and the ship broke down, and we got stuck. And it rained constantly. That sounds really boring. But actually really nice, you know? Just me and my dad hanging out for 10 days. Frank! Are you all right? I'm fine. I just dropped in to do a little shopping. I gotta lose this sled. Hold on! We'll pull you up. Jason! you've got to support Frank's weight. Okay, I'll try. Okay, I think I have his weight now. I'm coming to you. The glass is breaking! Too much weight. It's not gonna hold. No. No. Frank. I can get you out. Don't do it! - No, Frank, no! - Frank, no! Frank! What have you got there? A Gutenberg Bible. It was in the rare books room. You think god's gonna save you? No. I don't believe in god. You're holding onto that Bible pretty tight. I'm protecting it. This Bible is the first book ever printed. It represents the dawn of the age of reason. As far as I'm concerned, the written word is mankind's greatest achievement. You can laugh. But if Western civilization is finished I'm gonna save at least one little piece of it. We heard somebody was left behind. - We brought an ambulance. - Thank god. Thank you so much for coming. Hey. Hey, are you all right? You look like you have a fever or something. I'm fine. I just can't sleep. My mind keeps going over all those worthless decathlon facts. - It's pretty stupid, huh? - No, it's all right. I guess you just haven't had time to adjust yet. How am I supposed to adjust, Sam? Everything I've ever cared about, everything I've worked for has all been preparation for a future that no longer exists. I know you always thought I took the competition too seriously. You were right. - It was all for nothing. - No, no. I... No, I just... I just said that to avoid admitting the truth. Truth about what? About why I joined the team. I joined it because of you. Hey. I know. I know. - Mr. President. - All right. I'm sorry, sir, we can't wait any longer. We're the last ones. All right. Mexicali Control, this is Delta 26. We've got an urgent message for high command. Request priority for landing zone one. Roger that, Delta 26. Transport will be waiting. - Sir. - Thank you, corporal. - Sorry for the delay, sir. - Carry on. Madam Secretary. Raymond. The president's motorcade got caught in the storm. They didn't make it. And she wouldn't wake up this morning. I... I mean last night she only had a fever. I don't understand. She's awfully pale. Well guys, look. None of us has had anything real to eat in days. - I'm telling you it's hypothermia. - But how can it be hypothermia? - We've all been in... - Look maybe it's just the flu, you guys. No, no, it's not the flu. And how do you know? Books can be good for something other than burning. All right, let's go for her symptoms? I told you that she has a fever and her... She's got a really cold sweat. How's her pulse? - It's really fast. - Does she have any injuries? Like a cut or something that might have gotten infected? She was complaining about a cut on her leg a few days ago. I didn't think anything of it. Oh, my gosh. That's blood poisoning. Uh, Septicemia. She could go into septic shock. I've seen that before. That can get bad. She needs a massive dose of penicillin... or a broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately, or... Or what? I've never seen anything like it. There's no point of reference. All I could see is cloud cover. What are you doing? Taking infrared image of thermal currents. Send to Houston, Korolev, your weather service. I'll help you. Tom? Tom, wake up. I just received some satellite images from the space station. You better take a look. How big is this thing? The vortex is 50 miles in diameter. And growing. The two cells over Europe and Asia are even bigger. Good god. This one's gonna hit New York inside an hour. Jason! Are you all right? Jason! What are you doing? There's gotta be medicine on that ship. I thought you said it was too dangerous to go outside. I know I did. Where did you find those chairs? Why? I'm going with you. Me too. Come on, damn it! - It's all in Russian. I... - I know. - Hey, hey, hey, guys. I found it. - What? How do you know? Because it says ""penicillin"" on the bottle. Hey, wait a minute. This is the mess hall. We should find some food while we're here. No. We don't have time. Listen, none of us are gonna survive much longer without food, okay? Including Laura. Okay. - Sam, over here. - What? Bingo. Brian? - I'm okay. - What happened? All I did was open up the cupboard. - Well, we can use it. - Put food in it. Run! Pull him in, Brian! - You all right? - Oh, my god, there's more. My leg. Here, use this. It should be over New York by now. Satellite readings are showing a temperature drop of 10 degrees per second. You guys... I think we're in the eye of it. We gotta get back right now. Look, I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna lure the wolves out of the room. When they leave, you lock the door. Good luck. - Brian, hurry. - I need something. Come on, hurry! Brian! Brian, open the door! We have to get out of here now. Brian, get the supplies. Let's go! Pull, Brian! Take the medicine to Laura. We're almost there. Come on! Brian! Close the door! Don't let the fire go out! What's happening? Buddha, come away from the door. Come, Buddha, come! More books! More books! How long have I been out of it? Couple hours. How do you feel? Okay. What happened? Well, we had to get inside in kind of a hurry, so I, uh... sort of pushed you in. I should be used to you pushing me around. Good to have you back. What are you doing? The eye of the storm has passed, and we're 40 miles from Manhattan. Jack, shouldn't we wait one more day? Sam may not have one more day. What do you think's gonna happen to us? What do you mean? I mean us. Civilization. Everybody. Mankind survived the last Ice Age. We're certainly capable of surviving this one. All depends on whether or not we're able to learn from our mistakes. I sure as hell would like a chance to learn from mine. You did everything you could. I was thinking about Sam. Jack, you know the chances of Sam... I made my son a promise. I'm going to keep it. Parker, this is Houston. Do you read? Roger, mission control. Go ahead. We're getting scattered reports that the storm is dissipating over North America. Can you confirm? Affirmative. It's finally clearing. We're over Europe right now. I can see landmass for the first time in days. How much further is it to the library? It should be... right here. I'm sorry, Jack. Sam? Who is that? My father. You made it. Of course I did. Mr. President. I've just received a shortwave radio transmission from Jack Hall. He made it to New York. He says there are survivors. Thank you, Tom. That's... That's good news. These past few weeks have left us all with a profound sense of humility in the face of nature's destructive power. For years, we operated under the belief that we could continue consuming our planet's natural resources without consequence. We were wrong. I was wrong. The fact that my first address to you comes from a consulate on foreign soil is a testament to our changed reality. Not only Americans but people all around the globe are now guests in the nations we once called The Third World. In our time of need, they have taken us in and sheltered us. And I am deeply grateful for their hospitality. We mourn the loss of a spirited leader whose courageous order to evacuate... Peter? Hey. You feeling okay today? For days, we've despaired about the fate of the people who are trapped in the North. Today, there is cause for hope. Only a few hours ago, I received word that a small group of people survived in New York City against all odds and in the face of tremendous adversity. I've ordered an immediate search-and-rescue mission to bring them home and to look for more survivors. Jack! It's good to see you. Come on, let's go get on board. Look at that. What? Have you ever seen the air so clear?, Sir. General. Sir. Lean and hungry. - Still nothing? - Not a sign. How long has he been gone? Nearly two hours. Will they fight, sir? We shall know soon enough. Soldier, I ordered you to move those catapults forward. - They're out of range. - Range is good. - The danger to the cavalry... - Is acceptable. Agreed? They say no. People should know when they're conquered. Would you, Quintus? Would I? Strength and honor. At my signal, unleash hell. Load the catapults. Infantry form up for advance. Archers ready. Archers! Nock! Fratres! Maximus! Three weeks from now, I will be harvesting my crops. Imagine where you will be, and it will be so. Hold the line! Stay with me! If you find yourself alone... riding in green fields with the sun on your face... do not be troubled. For you are in Elysium, and you're already dead! Brothers... what we do in life... echoes in eternity. Pull! Catapults ready, sir! Archers, ignite! Ignite! Archers, draw! Loose! All right, men, ready! Hold the line! Loose! Reload! Hold the line! - Draw! - Loose! Stay with me! Stay with me! Roma victor! Roma victor! Do you think he's really dying? He's been dying for 10 years. If he weren't really dying, he wouldn't have sent for us. Maybe he just misses us. And the senators? He wouldn't have summoned them if... Peace, Commodus. After two weeks on the road, your incessant scheming is hurting my head. He's made his decision. He's going to announce it. He will name me. The first thing I shall do when... Is honor him with games worthy of His Majesty. For now, the first thing I shall do is have a hot bath. Your Highness? We seem to be almost there, sire. Sire. Where's the Emperor? He's at the front, sire. They've been gone for 19 days. The wounded are still coming in. My horse. My lord. Kiss? You have proved your valor yet again, Maximus. Let us hope, for the last time. There's no one left to fight, sire. There is always someone left to fight. How can I reward Rome's greatest general? Let me go home. Home. They honor you, Caesar. It's for you, Maximus. They honor you. Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle? You have missed the war. Father, congratulations. I shall sacrifice 100 bulls to honor your triumph. Save the bulls. Honor Maximus. He won the battle. General. Highness. Rome salutes you, and I embrace you as a brother. It has been too long, my old friend. Highness. Here, Father. Take my arm. I think it is time for me to leave. So much for the glory of Rome. Magnificent battle. General. Still alive? Still alive. The gods must have a sense of humor. The gods must love you. Valerius. Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome? Home. My wife, my son, the harvest. Maximus the farmer. I still have difficulty imagining that. You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus. - Here he is. - Highness. Senator Gaius, Senator Falco. Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear... and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is, Republic."" Well, why not? Rome was founded as a republic. Yes, and in a republic the senate has the power. But Senator Gaius isn't influenced by that, of course. Where do you stand, General? Emperor or Senate? A soldier has the advantage of being able to look his enemy in the eye, Senator. Well, with an army behind you, you could be extremely political. I warned you. Now I shall save you. Senators. Maximus. I'm going to need good men like you. How may I be of service, Highness? You're a man who knows what it is to command. You give your orders, the orders are obeyed, and the battle is won. But these senators scheme, squabble and flatter and deceive. We must save Rome from the politicians, my friend. Can I count on you when the time comes? Highness, when your father releases me, I intend to return home. Home? Well, no one's earned it more. Don't get too comfortable. I may call on you before long. Lucilla's here. Did you know? She's not forgotten you. And now, you're the great man. If only you had been born a man... what a Caesar you would have made. Father. You would have been strong. I wonder, would you have been just? I would have been what you taught me to be. How was your journey? Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come? I need your help. With your brother. Of course. He loves you. He always has. And... he will need you now, more than ever. Enough of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter... and I am a good father. This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it? Good morning. I need three more horses. Two! Three! Four! One! Two! You sent for me, Caesar? - Caesar? - Tell me again, Maximus. Why are we here? For the glory of the empire, sire. Yes. Yes, I remember. Do you see that map, Maximus? That is the world which I created. For 25 years... I have conquered, spilt blood, expanded the empire. Since I became Caesar, I've known four years without war. Four years of peace in 20. And for what? I brought the sword. Nothing more. Caesar, your life... Please. Please don't call me that. Come. Please. Come sit. Let us talk together now... very simply, as men. Well, Maximus... talk. 5,000 of my men are out there in the freezing mud. 3,000 of them are bloodied and cleaved. 2,000 will never leave this place. I will not believe that they fought and died for nothing. And what would you believe? They fought for you and for Rome. And what is Rome, Maximus? I've seen much of the rest of the world. It is brutal and cruel and dark. Rome is the light. Yet you have never been there. You have not seen what it has become. I am dying, Maximus. When a man sees his end... he wants to know there was some purpose to his life. How will the world speak my name in years to come? Will I be known as the philosopher? The warrior? The tyrant? Or will I be the Emperor who gave Rome back her true self? There was once a dream that was Rome. You could only whisper it. Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish... it was so fragile. And I fear that it will not survive the winter. Maximus... let us whisper now... together, you and I. You have a son. Tell me about your home. My house is in the hills above Trujillo. A very simple place. Pink stones that warm in the sun. A kitchen garden that smells of herbs in the day... jasmine in the evening. Through the gate is a giant poplar. Figs, apples, pears. The soil, Marcus, black. Black like my wife's hair. Grapes on the south slopes, olives on the north. Wild ponies play near my house. They tease my son. He wants to be one of them. When was the last time you were home? Two years, 264 days and this morning. I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home. Worth fighting for. There is one more duty... that I ask of you before you go home. What would you have me do, Caesar? I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die. I will empower you to one end alone... to give power back to the people of Rome... and end the corruption that has crippled it. Will you accept this great honor that I have offered you? With all my heart, no. Maximus... that is why it must be you. But surely a prefect, a senator... somebody who knows the city, who understands her politics. But you have not been corrupted by her politics. - And Commodus? - Commodus is not a moral man. You have known that since you were young. Commodus cannot rule. He must not rule. You are the son that I should have had. Commodus will accept my decision. He knows that you command the loyalty of the army. I need some time, sire. Yes. By sunset, I hope you will have agreed. Now embrace me as my son. And bring an old man another blanket. My father favors you now. My lady. - It was not always so. - Many things change. Many things. Not everything. Maximus, stop. Let me see your face. You seem upset. I lost many men. What did my father want with you? To wish me well before I leave for home. You're lying. I could always tell when you were lying because you were never any good at it. - I never acquired your comfort with it. - True. But then you never had to. Life is more simple for a soldier. Or do you think me heartless? I think you have a talent for survival. Maximus, stop. Is it really so terrible seeing me again? No. I'm tired from battle. It hurts you to see my father so fragile. Commodus expects that my father will announce his succession within days. Will you serve my brother as you served his father? I will always serve Rome. Do you know... I still remember you in my prayers. Oh, yes. I pray. I was sad to hear of your husband's death. I mourned him. - Thank you. - And I hear you have a son. Yes. Lucius. He'll be nearly eight years old. My son is also nearly eight. I thank you for your prayers. Ancestors, I ask for your guidance. Blessed Mother, come to me with the gods' desire for my future. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword. Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again. Ancestors, I honor you... and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me. Cicero. Sir. Do you ever find it hard to do your duty? Sometimes I do what I want to do. The rest of the time, I do what I have to. We may not be able to go home, after all. Are you ready to do your duty for Rome? Yes, Father. You will not be emperor. Which wiser, older man is to take my place? My powers will pass to Maximus... to hold in trust... until the Senate is ready to rule once more. Rome is to be a republic again. Maximus. Yes. My decision disappoints you? You wrote to me once... listing the four chief virtues: Wisdom... justice... fortitude... and temperance. As I read the list, I knew I had none of them. But I have other virtues, Father. Ambition. That can be a virtue when it drives us to excel. Resourcefulness, courage. Perhaps not on the battlefield, but there are many forms of courage. Devotion to my family... to you. But none of my virtues were on your list. Even then it was as if you didn't want me for your son. Commodus... you go too far. I searched the faces of the gods... for ways to please you, to make you proud. One kind word... one full hug... where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight... would have been like the sun on my heart for 1,000 years. What is it in me you hate so much? Commodus. All I've ever wanted... was to live up to you, Caesar. Father. Commodus... your faults as a son... is my failure as a father. Come. Father. I would butcher the whole world... if you would only have loved me! Maximus, the Emperor needs you. It's urgent. Lament with me, brother. Our great father is dead. How did he die? The surgeons say there was no pain. His breath gave out as he slept. Father. Your emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus. Take my hand. I only offer it once. Quintus. Hail, Caesar. I must talk to the senators. I need their counsel. - Wake Gaius and Falco. - Gaius and Falco. Sword. Maximus, please be careful. That was not prudent. Prudent? The Emperor has been slain. The Emperor died of natural causes. - Why are you armed, Quintus? - Guards! Please don't fight, Maximus. I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken. Ride until dawn... and then execute him. Quintus, look at me. Look at me! Promise me that you will look after my family. Your family will meet you in the afterlife. Kneel. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son. Whisper to them that I live only to hold them again. At least give me a clean death. A soldier's death. The frost, sometimes it makes the blade stick. Praetorian! When was the last time you were home? Two years, 264 days and this morning. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son... I will try to live with the dignity you have taught me. Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again. ... with a ready sword, for all else is dust and air. Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again. For all else is dust and air. Papa! Don't die. You'll meet them again. Not yet. No. They will clean it. Wait and see. Don't die. They'll feed you to the lions. They are worth more than we are. Better now? Clean. You see? Proximo! My old friend. Every day is a great day when you are here... but today is your most fortunate day. Those giraffes you sold me, they won't mate. They just walk around eating and not mating. You sold me queer giraffes. - I want my money back. - Not a chance. I do special price for you. On what? Have you seen my new stock? Come and see them. Do any of them fight? I've got a match coming up. Some are good for fighting, others for dying. You need both, I think. Get up. What's your trade? I was a hunter. No, I bought him from a salt mine in Carthage. Sit down. Mark of the legion. Deserter. Maybe so, but who cares? He's a Spaniard. I'll take six. For 1,000. One thousand? The Numidian alone is worth 2,000. These slaves are rotten. It all adds to the flavor. No, wait! I can negotiate. I'll give you 2,000, and 4,000 for the beasts. That's 5,000 for an old friend. Come on! How long does it take to get into my own house? I am Proximo. I shall be closer to you for the next few days... which will be the last of your miserable lives... than that bitch of a mother that brought you screaming into this world. I did not pay good money for you for your company. I paid it so that I could profit from your death. And as your mother was there at your beginning... so I shall be there at your end. And when you die, and die you shall... your transition shall be to the sound of... Gladiators... I salute you. Red. Yellow. Yellow. Good. Red. Spaniard. That's enough for the moment! His time will come. Next. Spaniard... why don't you fight? We all have to fight. Well, I don't fight. I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe, I write down words... and speak seven languages. Good. Tomorrow, you can scream in seven languages. Perhaps the scribe will be the one who wins his freedom. Freedom? What do I have to do? You go in the arena and you kill me. And him... and the Numidian... and the deserter. And 100 more. And when there's no more to fight, you're free. I can't do that. No? But I can. Is that the sign of your gods? Will that not anger them? The gods favor you. Red is the gods' color. You will need their help today. Proximo! Still leading with the German? The crowd love a barbarian. Besides that, he's making me rich. Has that Numidian fought before? No, first time. And that one, laborer, soldier? He's a Spaniard. He might as well be a eunuch, for what he brings to the ring. Five hundred sestertii, the Numidian and Spaniard team makes it through. And 1,000, that the Numidian makes it through alone. Are you asking me to bet against my own man? It's unethical. What if I make it 2,000? Some of you are thinking you won't fight... some that you can't fight. They all say that until they're out there. Listen. Kill! Thrust this into another man's flesh... and they will applaud and love you for that. And you... you may begin to love them... for that. Ultimately, we're all dead men. Sadly, we cannot choose how... but we can decide how we meet that end... in order that we are remembered... as men. Come on! On the left, draw your shields! On the right, draw your swords! Kill! Kill! Pair them up: Red with yellow. Next! Move! Usurper! Go away! You'll never rule us, Commodus! He enters Rome like a conquering hero. But what has he conquered? Give him time, Gracchus. He's young. I think he could do very well. For Rome, or for you? Go to your mother, Lucius. It's what she'd like. Lucius! Mother! Hail, Caesar. Senators. Rome greets her new emperor. Your loyal subjects bid you welcome, Highness. Thank you, Falco. And for the loyal subjects, I trust they weren't too expensive. Caesar. Gracchus. All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar. There are many matters that require your attention. To order, please. To order. For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate has prepared a series of protocols... to begin addressing the many problems in the city... beginning with basic sanitation for the Greek Quarter... to combat the plague which is already springing up there. So, if Caesar... Don't you see, Gracchus? That's the very problem, isn't it? My father spent all his time at study... at books of learning and philosophy. He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate. And all the while, the people were forgotten. But the Senate is the people, sire... chosen from among the people to speak for the people. I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Gracchus. Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius. I think I understand my own people. Then perhaps Caesar will be so good as to teach us... out of his own extensive experience. I call it love. I am their father. The people are my children. I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly. Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire? No, but if you interrupt me again... I assure you that you shall. Senator, my brother is very tired. Leave your list with me. Caesar shall do all that Rome requires. My lady, as always, your lightest touch commands obedience. Who are they to lecture me? Commodus, the Senate has its uses. What uses? All they do is talk. It should be just you and me and Rome. Don't even think it. There's always been a Senate. Rome has changed. It takes an emperor to rule an empire. Of course, but leave the people their... Illusions? Traditions. My father's war against the barbarians... He said it himself: It achieved nothing. But the people loved him. The people always love victories. Why? They didn't see the battles. What do they care about Germania? They care about the greatness of Rome. ""The greatness of Rome."" Well, what is that? It's an idea. Greatness. Greatness is a vision. Exactly. A vision. Do you not see, Lucilla? I will give the people a vision of Rome, and they'll love me for it. And they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry old men. I will give the people the greatest vision of their lives. White and red wine for your drinking pleasure! Games. One hundred and fifty days of games. He's cleverer than I thought. Clever. The whole of Rome would be laughing at him... if they weren't so afraid of his Praetorians. Fear and wonder. A powerful combination. You really think the people are going to be seduced by that? I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them, and they'll be distracted. Take away their freedom, and still they'll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate. It's the sand of the Colosseum. He'll bring them death... and they will love him for it. All you do is kill, kill, kill. The crowd don't want a butcher, they want a hero. We want them to keep coming back. So don't just hack them to pieces, remember you are an entertainer. Spaniard. So entertain! Are you not entertained? Is this not why you're here? Spaniard! What do you want? Girl? Boy? - You sent for me. - Yes, I did. You're good, Spaniard, but you're not that good. You could be magnificent. I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough. That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome. The young emperor has arranged a series of spectacles... to commemorate his father, Marcus Aurelius. I find that amusing... since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise... the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius, that closed us down. So finally, after five years of scratching a living... in flea-infested villages... we're finally going back to where we belong: The Colosseum. You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard. Fifty-thousand Romans... watching every movement of your sword... willing you to make that killer blow. The silence before you strike and the noise afterwards. It rises. It rises up... like a storm. As if you were the thunder god himself. - You were a gladiator? - Yes, I was. You won your freedom? A long time ago, the Emperor... presented me with a rudius. It's just a wooden sword. The symbol of your freedom. He touched me on the shoulder, and I was free. You knew Marcus Aurelius? I did not say I knew him. I said he touched me on the shoulder once. You asked me what I want. I, too, want to stand in front of the Emperor... as you did. Then listen to me. Learn from me. I wasn't the best because I killed quickly. I was the best because the crowd loved me. Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom. I will win the crowd. I will give them something they've never seen before. So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together... and have bloody adventures. And the great whore will suckle us... until we are fat and happy and can suckle no more. And then... when enough men have died... perhaps you will have your freedom. Here. Use this. It's somewhere out there, my country. My home. My wife is preparing food. My daughters carry water from the river. Will I ever see them again? I think, no. Do you believe you'll see them again when you die? I think so. But then, I will die soon. They will not die for many years. I'll have to wait. But you would? Wait? Of course. You see... my wife... and my son are already waiting for me. You'll meet them again. But not yet. Not yet. - Unless... - Not yet. Not yet. There he is. Out. Move, go, out! Good to see you again, old friend. Bring me fortune. Have you ever seen anything like that before? I didn't know men could build such things. Win the crowd. Get inside. Move. Inside. He sleeps so well because he's loved. Come, brother. It's late. I will make Rome the wonder of the ages. That is what Gracchus and his friends don't understand. All my desires are splitting my head to pieces. Commodus, drink this tonic. I think the time is almost right. I could announce the dissolution of the Senate... at the celebration to honor our father. Do you think I should? Are the people ready? I think you need your rest now. Will you stay with me? Still afraid of the dark, brother? Still. Always. - Stay with me tonight. - You know I won't. Then kiss me. Sleep, brother. Having servants who are deaf and mute... at least ensures I live a little longer. They're arresting scholars now. Anyone who dare speak out. Even satirists and chroniclers. And mathematicians. And all to feed the arena. The Senate did not approve martial law. This reign of terror is entirely the Praetorians. I'm afraid to go out after dark. You should be more afraid of your activities during the day. The Senate is full of his spies, led by that whore master, Falco. But what is in his mind? That's what I trouble myself with. He spends all his days singularly obsessed... planning the festival to honor your father. He neglects even the most fundamental task of government. So just what is he planning? And what pays for it? These daily games are costing a fortune, yet we have no new taxes. The future. The future pays for it. He's started selling the grain reserves. This can't be true. He's selling Rome's reserves of grain. The people will be starving in two years. I hope they're enjoying the games... because soon enough they'll be dead because of them. - Rome must know this. - And how? He's going to dissolve the Senate. And who will tell them before it's too late? You, Gracchus? You, Gaius. Will you make a speech on the floor of the Senate, denouncing my brother? And then see your family in the Colosseum? Who'd dare? I have been living in a prison of fear every day... because my son is heir to the throne. He must die. Quintus and the Praetorians would simply seize control for themselves. No. Cut off the head and the snake cannot strike. Lucilla, Gaius is right. Until we can neutralize the Praetorians, we can achieve nothing. So we do nothing? No, child. We keep our counsel. We prepare. As long as the people support him, we are voices without steel. We are air. But with every day that passes, he makes enemies. One day, he'll have more enemies than friends. And on that day, we will act. Then we will strike. But until then... we are docile. We are obedient. And we are treacherous. Come on! All right, that's enough. The Emperor wants battles, and I don't want to sacrifice my best fighters. The crowd wants battles, so the Emperor gives them battles. - You get the battle of Carthage. - Massacre of Carthage. Well, why don't you go down to the prison, round up all the beggars and thieves? We've done that. If you want to give away the best gladiators in the whole of the empire... then I want double the rates. You'll get your contract rates, or you'll get your contract cancelled. You don't like it? Then you can crawl back down that shit hole that you came from. Cassius, please. You can free us. Gladiator, are you the one they call the Spaniard? Yes. They said you were a giant. They said you could crush a man's skull with one hand. A man's? No. A boy's. - Do they have good horses in Spain? - Some of the best. This is Argento and this is Scarto. They were my horses. They were taken from me. I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you. - They let you watch the games? - My uncle says it makes me strong. - And what does your father say? - My father is dead. Master Lucius, it is time. I have to go. Your name is Lucius? Lucius Verus, after my father. Lower! Claudius! Yes? More shields! All right. When the Emperor enters, raise your weapons, salute him... and then speak together. Face the Emperor and don't turn your back on him. Go, and die with honor. Hail, mighty Caesar! Caesar! We who are about to die salute you! On this day... we reach back to hallowed antiquity... to bring you a re-creation of the second fall... of mighty Carthage! On the barren plain of Zama... there stood the invincible armies... of the barbarian Hannibal. Ferocious mercenaries and warriors... from all brute nations... bent on merciless destruction... conquest. Your emperor is pleased to give you... the barbarian horde! Anyone here been in the army? Yes. I served with you at Vindobona. You can help me. Whatever comes out of these gates... we've got a better chance of survival if we work together. Do you understand? If we stay together, we survive. The Emperor is pleased to bring you the legionnaires... of Scipio Africanus! To the death! Kill! Stay close. Come together! Stay close. Staggered columns! You don't have a chance. Lock your shields. Stay as one. Hold! Hold! As one! Well done. Hold. Down low! Yes! Hagen! This column to the chariot! This column stay with me! Quickly! - Get out there. - Hurry! Maximus! Single column! We win! My history's a little hazy, Cassius... but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage? Yes, sire. Forgive me, sire. No, I rather enjoy surprises. Who is he? They call him the Spaniard, sire. I think I'll meet him. Yes, sire. Hail to the barbarians! Forward! Arms at ready! Drop your weapons. Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you. I am at the Emperor's service. Rise. Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard. I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you. As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn. Or was it Hercules? Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name? You do have a name. My name is Gladiator. How dare you show your back to me? Slave! You will remove your helmet and tell me your name. My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius... commander of the armies of the north... general of the Felix Legions... loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius... father to a murdered son... husband to a murdered wife... and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next. Arms! Live! Arms, at rest! Maximus! Father. Why is he still alive? I don't know. He shouldn't be alive. It vexes me. I'm terribly vexed. I did what I had to do. If Father had had his way, the empire would have been torn apart. You do see that. Yes. What did you feel when you saw him? I felt nothing. He wounded you deeply, didn't he? No more than I wounded him. They lied to me in Germania. They told me he was dead. If they lie to me, they don't respect me. If they don't respect me, how can they ever love me? Then you must let the legions know... their treachery will not go unpunished. Poor sister. I wouldn't want to be your enemy. What will you do? This way. Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions. I knew your brother would send assassins. I didn't realize he would send his best. Maximus, he doesn't know. My family was burnt and crucified while they were still alive. - I knew nothing... - Don't lie to me! I wept for them. As you wept for your father? I have been living in a prison of fear since that day. To be unable to mourn your father for fear of your brother. To live in terror every moment of every day... because your son is heir to the throne. I have wept. My son was innocent. So is mine. Must my son die, too, before you'll trust me? What does it matter if I trust you or not? The gods have spared you. Don't you understand? Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of Rome. The gods have spared me? I am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse a mob. That is power. The mob is Rome. And while Commodus controls them, he controls everything. Listen to me. My brother has enemies, most of all in the Senate. But while the people follow him... no one would dare stand up to him until you. They oppose him, yet they do nothing. There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome. One man above all. If I can arrange it, will you meet him? Do you not understand? I may die in this cell tonight, or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave! What possible difference can I make? This man wants what you want. Then have him kill Commodus! I knew a man once... a noble man. A man of principle who loved my father... and my father loved him. This man served Rome well. That man is gone. Your brother did his work well. Let me help you. Yes, you can help me. Forget you ever knew me, never come here again. Guard! The lady is finished with me. What's your name? Julian Crassus. Name? Marcus, sire. My father's name. They must have known of Maximus' escape when they found the bodies of the four men. They thought it was a barbarian raid. These are good men, sire. Loyal to the Emperor. Load your arrows! Prepare to fire! Then perhaps it was you who knew... and never told me. - I didn't know. - You didn't know? But a general is always in control. Always in command, isn't he? Yes, Caesar. Then give the command. Say it. Fire. Maximus. You commanded legions? You had many victories? - Yes. - In Germania? In many countries. General. You have a great name. He must kill your name before he kills you. Yes, at the far end. Senator Gaius. Hello. Senator Gracchus. Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures of the vulgar crowd. I don't pretend to be a man of the people, Senator... but I do try to be a man for the people. Caesar! People of Rome! On the fourth day of Antioch... we can celebrate the 64th day of the games. And in his majestic charity... the Emperor has deigned this day to favor the people of Rome... with an historical final match. Returning to the Colosseum today, after five years in retirement... Caesar is pleased to bring you... the only undefeated champion... in Roman history: The legendary Tigris of Gaul! He knows too well how to manipulate the mob. Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo. This is not it. Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus. We mortals are but shadows and dust. Shadows and dust, Maximus! Representing the training lyceum of Antonius Proximo... Caesar is proud to give you... Aelius Maximus! They embrace him like he's one of their own. The mob is fickle, brother. He'll be forgotten in a month. No, much sooner than that. It's been arranged. We who are about to die salute you. We're with you, Maximus! Fight on, finish it! Pull, pull! Loose! Loose! Gut him! Kill! Kill! Maximus the Merciful! Maximus! Forward, arms at ready! What am I going to do with you? You simply won't die. Are we so different, you and I? You take life when you have to, as I do. I have only one more life to take. Then it is done. Then take it now. They tell me your son... squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross. And your wife... moaned like a whore... when they ravaged her again and again... and again. The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end... Highness. Maximus! General! General! Cicero! - Where are you camped? - Ostia. We love you, Maximus! Praise the victor! Tell the men their general lives. Find me. Move along! Find me! Can they hear you? - Who? - Your family, in the afterlife. Yes. What do you say to them? To my boy... I tell him I will see him again soon... and to keep his heels down when he's riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business. And now they love Maximus for his mercy. So I can't just kill him, or it makes me even more unmerciful. The whole thing is like some great nightmare. He is defying you. His every victory is an act of defiance. The mob sees this, and so do the Senate. Every day he lives, they grow bolder. - Kill him. - No. I will not make a martyr of him. When I went to the Senate today... I purposefully told them about using the grain reserves to pay for the games. And did you note what happened? - Nothing. - Exactly. Nothing. Not a single word of protest. Even the insolent Senator Gracchus was silent as a mouse. Why? I have been told of a certain sea snake... which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey. It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as if wounded. Then its enemies will approach... and yet it will lie quite still. And then its enemies will take little bites of it... and yet it remains still. So... we will lie still... and let our enemies come to us and nibble. Have every senator followed. Cicero, my old friend. I thought perhaps I'd seen you for the last time. I thought you were dead. Close. - How long have the men been in Ostia? - All winter. - And how do they look? - Fat and bored. Who's in command? Some fool from Rome. How soon do you think they could be ready to fight? For you, tomorrow. I need you to do something for me. Come, see, witness. If you haven't been in the arena, you can see the show here. Giant Maximus is defeating our emperor, Commodus. What are we to do? He's just defying everyone... by doing this to him, they do... My goodness! He got him, he's defeated. Give way! My lady? I served your father at Vindobona. Back. My lady. I served your father at Vindobona. Back! And I served General Maximus. I serve him still. Stop. Stand back. The General sends word, he will meet your politician. - For your loyalty, soldier. - Thank you, my lady. Leave us. Senator Gracchus. General. I hope my coming here today is evidence enough... that you can trust me. - The Senate is with you? - The Senate? Yes. I can speak for them. You can buy my freedom and smuggle me out of Rome? To what end? Get me outside the city walls. Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia. My army is encamped there. By nightfall of the second day, I'll return at the head of 5,000 men. But the legions all have new commanders... loyal to Commodus. Let my men see me alive, and you shall see where their loyalties lie. This is madness. No Roman army has entered the capital in 100 years. I will not trade one dictatorship for another! The time for half measures and talk is over, Senator. And after your glorious coup, what then? You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave? I will leave. The soldiers will stay for your protection under the command of the Senate. So... once all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the people? Tell me why. Because that was the last wish of a dying man. I will kill Commodus. The fate of Rome I leave to you. Marcus Aurelius trusted you. His daughter trusts you. I will trust you. But we have little time. Give me two days... and I will buy your freedom. And you... You stay alive... or I'll be dead. Now we must go. He'll be waiting for you. Stand at the foot of the colossus. He'll find you. It won't work. The Emperor knows too much. And as for me... it's becoming dangerous. You'll be paid on my return. I give you my word. Your word? What if you don't return? Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo? Trust? Who am I to trust? I will kill Commodus. Why would I want that? He makes me rich. I know that you are a man of your word, General. I know that you would die for honor. You would die for Rome. You would die for the memory of your ancestors. But I, on the other hand... I'm an entertainer. Guard! He killed the man who set you free. Praetorians, master. Halt! Where have you been? I sent for you. Please, brother. What's troubling you? Does Gracchus have a new lover? I don't know. I thought you'd seen him. He infects everyone like a putrid fever. For the health of Rome, the Senate must be bled. And he will bleed, too. Very soon. But not tonight. Do you remember what our father said once? ""It's a dream... ""a frightful dream... ""life is."" Do you think that's true? I don't know. I think it is. And I have only you to share it with. Open your mouth. You know I love you. And I love you. Out. Get out! Move! Congratulations, General. You've got very persuasive friends. My brother has had Gracchus arrested. We daren't wait any longer. We must leave tonight. Proximo will come at midnight and take you to the gate. Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there with horses. You have done all this? Yes. You risk too much. I have much to pay for. You have nothing to pay for. You love your son. You're strong for him. I am tired of being strong. My brother hates all the world, and you most of all. Because your father chose me. No. Because my father loved you. And because I loved you. A long time ago. Was I very different then? You laughed more. I have felt alone all my life... except with you. I must go. Yes. There. And I got you. Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire? I'm not a legionnaire. - Not a legionnaire? - I'm a gladiator. A gladiator? Gladiators only fight in the games. Wouldn't you rather be a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar? I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome! The savior of Rome? And who said that? Where's Lucius? He's with the Emperor, my lady. She couldn't. She did. She took it from a basket... and pressed it to her breast, right here above her heart. It bit her in the breast? Yes. You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies... behave very strangely and do very odd things in the name of love. I think it's silly. So do I. Sister, join us. I've been reading to dear Lucius. I've been reading, too. Yes. He's a very clever little boy. He'll make a grand emperor one day. We've been reading about the great Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt. And the queen killed herself with a snake. And just wait until you hear what happened to our ancestors. If you're very good, tomorrow night I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius. He was betrayed... by those closest to him. By his own blood. They whispered in dark corners... and went out late at night... and conspired, and conspired. But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something. He knew they were busy little bees. And one night he sat down with one of them... and he looked at her... and he said: ""Tell me what you've been doing... ""busy little bee. ""Or I shall strike down those dearest to you. ""You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."" And the Emperor was heartbroken. The little bee had wounded him more deeply than anyone else could ever have done. What do you think happened then, Lucius? I don't know, Uncle. The little bee told him everything. Open, in the name of the Emperor! Proximo! Open the gates, in the name of the Emperor! Open the gates! Open the gates, Proximo. Do you want to die, old man? Here. Everything is prepared. It seems you have won your freedom. Proximo, are you in danger of becoming a good man? - Juba. - All enemies of the emperor die! Open the gates! Pull! Move! Form a column on the left! I only need moments, so do not be careless with your lives. If you don't want any part of this, go back to your cells. We'll wait here for you, Maximus. Strength and honor. Go. Strength and honor. Aim. Arch your bows! Shadows and dust. Maximus! I'm sorry. It's done. And what of my nephew? And what of his mother? Should they share her lover's fate? Or should I be merciful? Commodus the Merciful. Lucius will stay with me now. And if his mother... so much as looks at me... in a manner that displeases me... he will die. If she decides to be noble... and takes her own life... he will die. And as for you... you will love me... as I have loved you. You will provide me with an heir of pure blood... so that Commodus... and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years. Am I not merciful? Am I not merciful! Maximus! I'm a soldier. I obey. Nothing happens to anyone that he is not fitted by nature to bear. Maximus! They call for you. The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor. A striking story. Now the people want to know how the story ends. Only a famous death will do. And what could be more glorious... than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena? You would fight me? Why not? Do you think I'm afraid? I think you have been afraid all your life. Unlike Maximus the Invincible, who knows no fear? I knew a man who once said, ""Death smiles at us all. ""All a man can do is smile back."" I wonder... did your friend smile at his own death? You must know. He was your father. You loved my father, I know... but so did I. That makes us brothers, doesn't it? Smile for me now, brother. Strap on his armor. Conceal the wound. Ring formation! Quintus, sword. Give me your sword. Sword! Give me a sword! Sheathe your swords. Maximus. Quintus. Free my men. Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated. There was a dream that was Rome. It shall be realized. These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius. Free the prisoners. Go! Maximus. Lucius is safe. Go to them. You're home. Is Rome worth one good man's life? We believed it once. Make us believe it again. He was a soldier of Rome. Honor him. Who will help me carry him? Now we are free. I will see you again. But not yet. Not yet., - You cannot pass! - Gandalf! I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. Go back to the Shadow. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udn! You shall not pass! No! No! Gandalf! Fly, you fools. No! Gandalf! Gandalf! What is it, Mr. Frodo? Nothing. Just a dream. Can you see the bottom? No! Don't look down, Sam! Just keep going! Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo! Mr. Frodo! I think I've found the bottom. Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what. It's not natural. None of it. - What's in this? - Nothing. Just a bit of seasoning. I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something. Roast chicken?! You never know. Sam. My dear Sam. It's very special, that. It's the best salt in all the Shire. It is special. It's a little bit of home. We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down. Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo? It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that. Real Elvish rope. Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots. Won't come free in a hurry. Real Elvish rope. Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer. And it's the one place we're trying to get to. It's just where we can't get. Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost. I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way. He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam... ...but they did. Mr. Frodo? It's the Ring, isn't it? It's getting heavier. - What food have we got left? - Let me see. Oh, yes. Lovely. Lembas bread. And look! More lembas bread. I don't usually hold with foreign food... ...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad. Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam? Those rain clouds might. This looks strangely familiar. It's because we've been here before. We're going in circles. What is that horrid stink? I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. - Can you smell it? - Yes. I can smell it. We're not alone. The thieves. The thieves. The filthy little thieves. Where is it? Where is it? They stole it from us. My precious. Curse them, we hates them! It's ours, it is, and we wants it! This is Sting. You've seen it before... ...haven't you, Gollum? Release him or I'll cut your throat. It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty Elves twisted it. - Take it off us! - Quiet, you! It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket. - Let's just tie him up and leave him. - No! That would kill us! Kill us! It's no more than you deserve! Maybe he does deserve to die. But now that I see him, I do pity him. We be nice to them if they be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears to do what you wants. We swears. There's no promise you can make that I can trust. We swears... ...to serve the master of the precious. We will swear on... ...on the precious. Gollum. Gollum. The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word. Yes... ...on the precious. On the precious. I don't believe you! - Get down! I said, down! - Sam! He's trying to trick us. If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep. - You know the way to Mordor? - Yes. You've been there before? Yes. You will lead us to the Black Gate. To the Gate, to the Gate! To the Gate, the master says. Yes! No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him. They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum! But we swore to serve the master of the precious. No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits. And Orcses, thousands of Orcses. And always the Great Eye watching, watching. Hey! Come back now! Come back! There! What did I tell you? He's run off, the old villain. So much for his promises. This way, Hobbits. Follow me! Merry! Merry! You're late. Our master grows impatient. He wants the Shire-rats now. I don't take orders from Orc-maggots. Saruman will have his prize. We will deliver them. Merry! Merry? Wake up. My friend is sick. He needs water. Please! Sick, is he? Give him some medicine, boys! Stop it! Can't take his draught! - Leave him alone! - Why? You want some? Then keep your mouth shut. Merry. Hello, Pip. - You're hurt. - I'm fine. - It was just an act. - An act? See? I fooled you too. Don't worry about me, Pippin. What is it? What do you smell? Man-flesh. They've picked up our trail. Aragorn. Let's move! Their pace has quickened. They must have caught our scent. Hurry! Come on, Gimli! Three days and nights pursuit. No food. No rest. And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell. Not idly do the leaves of Lrien fall. They may yet be alive. Less than a day ahead of us. Come. Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them! I'm wasted on cross-country. We Dwarves are natural sprinters. Very dangerous over short distances. Rohan. Home of the Horse-lords. There's something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures. Sets its will against us. Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see? The Uruks turn northeast. They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard. Saruman. The world is changing. Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard... ...and Mordor? To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman... ...and the union of the two towers? Together, my Lord Sauron... ...we shall rule this Middle-earth. The Old World will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear... ...and the iron fists of the Orc. I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks! But, my lord, there are too many! They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means. Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day. We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires. The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep. - Burn it. - Yes. We will fight for you. Swear it. We will die for Saruman. The Horse-Men took your lands. They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks. Murderers! Take back the lands they stole from you. Burn every village! We have only to remove those who oppose us. It will begin in Rohan. Too long have these peasants stood against you. But no more. othain! othain! You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two. Papa says othain must not ride Garulf. He is too big for him. Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm. - Do you understand me? - Yes, Mama. I don't want to leave. I don't want to go, Mama. Freda, I will find you there. Quickly! Go, child. Rohan, my lord... ...is ready to fall. Thodred. Find the king's son! - Mordor will pay for this. - These Orcs are not from Mordor. My Lord omer, over here! He's alive. Thodred. Your son is badly wounded, my lord. He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force. That is a lie. Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally. Grima. Grima. Grima. Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman. Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind? Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent... ...your warmongering. Warmongering? How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Grima? When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure? Too long have you watched my sister. Too long have you haunted her steps. You see much, omer, son of omund. Too much. You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan... ...and all its domains under pain of death. You have no authority here. Your orders mean nothing. This order does not come from me. It comes from the king. He signed it this morning. Keep breathing. That's the key. Breathe. They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them. We're not going no further... ...until we've had a breather. Get a fire going! Merry! Merry! I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin. What's making that noise? It's the trees. What? You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland? Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... ...and come alive. Alive? Trees that could whisper... ...talk to each other... ...even move. I'm starving. We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days. Yeah! Why can't we have some meat?! What about them? They're fresh. They are not for eating. What about their legs? They don't need those. - They look tasty. - Get back, scum! The prisoners go to Saruman. Alive and unspoiled. Alive? Why alive? Do they give good sport? They have something. An Elvish weapon. The master wants it for the war. They think we have the Ring. As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead. Just a mouthful... ...a bit of the flank. Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys. Pippin. Let's go. Go on. Call for help. Squeal. No one's going to save you now. Pippin! A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night. Riders of Rohan... ...what news from the Mark? What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly! Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine. I would cut off your head, Dwarf... ...if it stood but a little higher from the ground. You would die before your stroke fell. I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Glin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Thoden, your king. Thoden no longer recognizes friend from foe. Not even his own kin. Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king... ...and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there, they say... ...as an old man hooded and cloaked. And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets. We are no spies. We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. They have taken two of our friends captive. The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night. But there were two Hobbits. Did you see two Hobbits with them? They would be small. Only children to your eyes. We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them. Dead? I am sorry. Hasufel! Arod! May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters. Farewell. Look for your friends. But do not trust to hope. It has forsaken these lands. We ride north! It's one of their wee belts. We failed them. A Hobbit lay here. And the other. They crawled. Their hands were bound. Their bonds were cut. They ran over here. They were followed. The belt! Run! Tracks lead away from the battle... ...into Fangorn Forest. Fangorn? What madness drove them in there? Did we lose him? I think we lost him. I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards! Come here! Trees. Climb a tree. He's gone. Merry! Let's put a maggot hole in your belly! Run, Merry! Little Orcs. It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking. Tree? I am no tree! I am an Ent. A tree-herder. A shepherd of the forest. Don't talk to it, Merry. Don't encourage it! Treebeard, some call me. And whose side are you on? Side? I am on nobody's side... ...because nobody's on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore. We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits! Hobbits? Never heard of a Hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me! They come with fire. They come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! - Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them! - No! You don't understand. We're Hobbits! Halflings! Shire-folk! Maybe you are... ...and maybe you aren't. The White Wizard will know. The White Wizard? Saruman. See? See? We've led you out. Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry! Very lucky we find you. Nice Hobbit. It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp. A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist. Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly. I found it. I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go around for miles and miles. Come quickly. Soft and quick as shadows we must be. I hate this place. It's too quiet. There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days. No, no birdses to eat. No crunchable birdses. We are famished! Yes! Famished we are, precious! Here. What does it eats? Is it tasty? It tries to chokes us! We can't eats Hobbit food! We must starve! Well, starve, then. And good riddance! Oh, cruel Hobbit. It does not care if we be hungry. Does not care if we should die. Not like master. Master cares. Master knows. Yes. Precious. Once it takes hold of us... ...it never lets go. Don't touch me! There are dead things! Dead faces in the water. All dead. All rotten. Elves and Men and Orcses. A great battle long ago. Dead Marshes. Yes. Yes, that is their name. This way. Don't follow the lights. Careful now! Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones... ...and light little candles of their own. Frodo! - Gollum? - Don't follow the lights. - Gollum! - Mr. Frodo! Are you all right? So bright. So beautiful. Our precious. What did you say? Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength. - Who are you? - Mustn't ask us. Not its business. Gollum. Gollum. Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk. Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home He said your life was a sad story. They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead You were not so very different from a Hobbit once. Were you? Smagol. What did you call me? That was your name once, wasn't it? A long time ago. My name. My name. Smagol. Black Riders! Hide! Hide! Come on, Frodo. Come on! Quick! They will see us! They will see us! - I thought they were dead. - Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No. Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the precious. Mr. Frodo! It's all right. I'm here. Hurry, Hobbits. The Black Gate is very close. Orc blood. These are strange tracks. The air is so close in here. This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory... ...and anger. The trees are speaking to each other. Gimli! Lower your ax. They have feelings, my friend. The Elves began it. Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak. Talking trees. What do trees have to talk about? Except the consistency of squirrel droppings. Something's out there. What do you see? The White Wizard approaches. Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us. We must be quick. You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits. Where are they? They passed this way the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you? Who are you? Show yourself! It cannot be. Forgive me. I mistook you for Saruman. I am Saruman. Or rather, Saruman as he should have been. You fell. Through fire... ...and water. From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak... ...I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth. U ntil at last I threw down my enemy... ...and smote his ruin upon the mountainside. Darkness took me... ...and I strayed out of thought and time. Stars wheeled overhead... ...and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again. I've been sent back... ...until my task is done. Gandalf. Gandalf? Yes. That was what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name. Gandalf. I am Gandalf the White. And I come back to you now... ...at the turn of the tide. One stage of your journey is over. Another begins. - We must travel to Edoras with all speed. - Edoras? That is no short distance! We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill with the king. Yes, and it will not be easily cured. Then we have run all this way for nothing? Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here... ...in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested...? I mean, charming... ...quite charming forest. It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn. A great power has been sleeping here for many long years. The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones... ...that starts an avalanche in the mountains. I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend. You still speak in riddles. A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days. The Ents are going to wake up... ...and find that they are strong. - Strong?! Oh, that's good. So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf. Merry and Pippin are quite safe. I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be. This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one. That is one of the Mearas... ...unless my eyes are cheated by some spell. Shadowfax. He is the lord of all horses... ...and has been my friend through many dangers. O rowan mine I saw you shine U pon a summer's day U pon your head How golden-red The crown you bore aloft Such a beautiful verse. - Is it much further? - Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty. You might call it far, perhaps. My home lies deep in the forest... ...near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe. And safe is where I'll keep you. I believe you will enjoy this next one too. It's one of my own compositions. Right. Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves And the dreams of trees unfold When woodland halls are green and cool And the wind is in the West Come back to me Come back to me And say my land is best Sleep, little Shirelings. Heed no nightly noise. Sleep till morning light. I have business in the forest. There are many to call. Many that must come. The Shadow lies on Fangorn. The withering of all woods is drawing near. The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape. Sauron will suffer no rival. From the summit of Barad-dr, his Eye watches ceaselessly. But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear. Doubt ever gnaws at him. The rumor has reached him. The heir of Nmenor still lives. Sauron fears you, Aragorn. He fears what you may become. And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men. He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan. War is coming. Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge... ...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall. The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's. His hold over King Thoden is now very strong. Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose. But for all their cunning... ...we have one advantage. The Ring remains hidden. And that we should seek to destroy it... ...has not yet entered their darkest dreams. And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor... ...in the hands of a Hobbit. Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom. We must trust now in Frodo. Everything depends upon speed... ...and the secrecy of his quest. Do not regret your decision to leave him. Frodo must finish this task alone. He's not alone. Sam went with him. Did he? Did he, indeed? Good. Yes, very good. The Black Gate of Mordor. Oh, save us. My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now. Master says to show him the way into Mordor. So good Smagol does, master says so. I did. That's it, then. We can't get past that. Look! The gate. It's opening! I can see a way down. Sam, no! Master! - I do not ask you to come with me, Sam. - I know, Mr. Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there. - Now! - No! No! No, master! They catch you! They catch you! Don't take it to him. He wants the precious. Always he is looking for it. And the precious is wanting to go back to him. But we mustn't let him have it. No! There's another way. More secret. A dark way. - Why haven't you spoken of this before? - Because master did not ask. He's up to something. Are you saying there's another way into Mordor? Yes. There's a path... ...and some stairs. And then... ...a tunnel. He's led us this far, Sam. Mr. Frodo, no. He's been true to his word. No. Lead the way, Smagol. Good Smagol always helps. Hello? Treebeard? Where has he gone? I had the loveliest dream last night. There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed. And we smoked all of it. And then... ...you were sick. I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby. Did you hear that? There it is again. Something's not right here. Not right at all. You just said something... Treeish. No, I didn't. I was just stretching. You're taller. - Who? - You! - Than what? - Than me! I've always been taller than you. Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one. You're the short one. Please, Merry. You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most? Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7"". Three-foot-eight. You did something. Merry, don't! Don't drink it! Merry! No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any. - I want some! - It could well be dangerous! Give me it back. Merry! What's happening?! It's got my leg! Merry! Help! Away with you. You should not be waking. Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water. Go to sleep. Away with you. Come, the forest is waking up. It isn't safe. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. Black are their thoughts. Strong is their hate. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them. Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long? - Are there Ent children? - Bru-ra-hroom. There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years. - Why is that? - We lost the Entwives. Oh, I'm sorry. - How did they die? - Die? No. We lost them. And now we cannot find them. I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire? Can't say that I have. You, Pip? What do they look like? I don't remember now. Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Thoden, King of Rohan... ...whose mind is overthrown. Saruman 's hold over King Thoden is now very strong. My lord, your son... ...he is dead. My lord? Uncle? Will you not go to him? Will you do nothing? Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here. Oh, he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king... ...to lose his only son and heir. I understand. His passing is hard to accept. Especially now that your brother has deserted you. Leave me alone, snake! Oh, but you are alone. Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness... ...in the bitter watches of the night... ...when all your life seems to shrink. The walls of your bower closing in about you. A hutch to trammel some wild thing in. So fair. So cold. Like a morning of pale spring... ...still clinging to winter's chill. Your words are poison. You'll find more cheer in a graveyard. I cannot allow you before Thoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Grima Wormtongue. Your staff. You would not part an old man from his walking stick. My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He's a herald of woe. The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late... ...Thoden King. He's not welcome. Why should I welcome you... ...Gandalf Stormcrow? A just question, my liege. Late is the hour... ...in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lthspell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest. Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and death... ...to bandy crooked words with a witless worm. His staff. I told you to take the wizard's staff. Thoden... ...son of Thengel... ...too long have you sat in the Shadows. I would stay still if I were you. Hearken to me! I release you... ...from the spell. You have no power here... ...Gandalf the Grey. I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound. Wait. If I go, Thoden dies. You did not kill me... ...you will not kill him. Rohan is mine. Be gone. I know your face. owyn. owyn. Gandalf? Breathe the free air again, my friend. Dark have been my dreams of late. Your fingers would remember their old strength better... ...if they grasped your sword. I've only... ...ever served you, my lord. Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast! Send me not from your sight. No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilt on his account. Get out of my way! Hail, Thoden King! Where is Thodred? Where is my son? Simbelmyn. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers. Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live... ...to see the last days of my house. Thodred's death was not of your making. No parent should have to bury their child. He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree. Where is Mama? This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. You must fight. You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. omer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king. They will be 300 leagues from here by now. omer cannot help us. I know what it is you want of me... ...but I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war. Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not. When last I looked... ...Thoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan. Then what is the king's decision? By order of the king... ...the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep. Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you need. Helm's Deep. They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king? He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm's Deep has saved them in the past. There is no way out of that ravine. Thoden is walking into a trap. He thinks he's leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Thoden has a strong will, but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defenses have to hold. They will hold. The Grey Pilgrim. That's what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the east. Go. That horse is half mad, my lord. There's nothing you can do. Leave him. His name is Brego. He was my cousin's horse. Brego. Your name is kingly. I have heard of the magic of Elves... ...but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North. You speak as one of their own. I was raised in Rivendell... ...for a time. Turn this fellow free. He's seen enough of war. Gandalf the White. Gandalf the Fool! Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety? There were three who followed the wizard. An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man. You stink of horse. The Man... ...was he from Gondor? - No, from the North. One of the Dnedain Rangers, I thought he was. His cloth was poor. And yet he bore a strange ring. Two serpents with emerald eyes. One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers. The Ring of Barahir. So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir. The lost king of Gondor. He is a fool. The line was broken years ago. It matters not. The world of Men shall fall. It will begin at Edoras. I am ready, Gamling. Bring my horse. This is not a defeat. We will return. We will return. You have some skill with a blade. Women of this country learned long ago: Those without swords can still die upon them. I fear neither death nor pain. What do you fear, my lady? A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them. And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire. You're a daughter of kings... ...a shieldmaiden of Rohan. I do not think that would be your fate. Thoden will not stay at Edoras. It's vulnerable. He knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They will flee to Helm's Deep... ...the great fortress of Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. They will be slow. They will have women and children with them. Send out your Warg-riders. Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead. - Why do you do that? - What? Call him names. Run him down all the time. Because. Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in him but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about. You have no idea what it did to him... ...what it's still doing to him. I want to help him, Sam. Why? Because I have to believe he can come back. You can't save him, Mr. Frodo. What do you know about it? Nothing! I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that. I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo. - You have to fight it. - I know what I have to do, Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task. Mine! My own! Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know who you sound like? We wants it. We needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little Hobbitses. Wicked. Tricksy. False. No. Not master. Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie! Master's my friend. You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you. Not listening. I'm not listening. You're a liar and a thief. No. Murderer. Go away. Go away? I hate you. I hate you. Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me. Not anymore. What did you say? Master looks after us now. We don't need you. What? Leave now... ...and never come back. No. Leave now and never come back. Leave now and never come back! We told him to go away. And away he goes, precious. Gone! Gone! Gone! Smagol is free! Look. Look. See what Smagol finds? They are young. They are tender. They are nice. Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them! You'll make him sick, you will... ...behaving like that. There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys. What's it doing? Stupid, fat Hobbit. It ruins it. What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them. What we need is a few good taters. What's taters, precious? What's taters? Eh? Po-ta-toes. Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew. Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish. Even you couldn't say no to that. Oh, yes, we could. Spoil a nice fish. Give it to us raw... ...and wriggling. You keep nasty chips. You're hopeless. Mr. Frodo? - Who are they? - Wicked Men. Servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armies to him. It won't be long now. He will soon be ready. - Ready to do what? - To make his war. The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow. We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam. Mr. Frodo. Look. It's an oliphaunt. No one at home will believe this. Smagol? We've lingered here too long. Come on, Sam. Wait! We're innocent travelers! There are no travelers in this land. Only servants of the Dark Tower. We are bound to an errand of secrecy. Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us. The enemy? His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem. You wonder what his name is... ...where he came from. And if he was really evil at heart. What lies or threats led him on this long march from home. If he would not rather have stayed there... ...in peace. War will make corpses of us all. Bind their hands., Mutants. Since the discovery of their existence... they have been regarded with fear... suspicion, often hatred. Across the planet, debate rages. Are mutants the next link in the evolutionary chain... or simply a new species of humanity... fighting for their share of the world? Either way, it is an historical fact: Sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute. ""We are not enemies, but friends. ""We must not be enemies. ""Though passion may have strained... it must not break the bonds of our affection. "" Lincoln said that in his first inaugural address as our nation's 16th president. It's one of my favorites. So, if youll please have your tickets ready... we can begin the tour. Jackie, could you clear my schedule this evening? I wanna have dinner with my son. Yes, Mr. President. Excuse me, sir. Are you lost? Perimeter breach at visitor's checkpoint. Multiple subjects. Mr. President, security breach. Jackie, leave. Let's get him out to the car. Exit's not clear. We don't know how many there are. Post five. Secure. - There's something in the corridor. - To the shelter. Negative! Not clear! - It's outside the oval office. - Lock this place down! - Don't shoot! - There! My God. Neanderthals. We once believed that they were wiped out... by years of conflict with a much more advanced branch of humanity... called Cro-Magnon man. But recent research into our own DNA... suggests that these two species may have interbred... evolving into modern humans. In other words, into what? Us. Us. Right. Artie, not here. Come on. Pay attention. Makes me insane when she does this. What are you looking at, you sick Busted my lip. - I have cancer. - To the shelter! - No! - Hi. They're gonna kill What's wrong with this? It doesn't work. Jean? You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. It's just, uh just a headache. It's not just a headache, is it? Listen, I I wasn't really sure how to say this... but ever since Liberty Island, you've been Scott. You've been different. My telepathy's been off lately. I can't seem to focus. I can hear everything. It's not just your telepathy. A month ago, you had to concentrate just to levitate a book or a chair across the room. Now, when you have a nightmare, the entire bedroom shakes. My dreams are getting worse. Scott. I keep feeling something terrible is about to happen. I would never let anything happen to you. Hey. Have you guys seen Bobby and Rogue? Something's happening in the food court. My brother asked you a simple question. Why are you being such a dick? Yeah, why are you being such a dick? Because I can. Can I have a light? Hmm. - Sorry. I can't help you out, pal. - John, knock it off. - Why don't you stop showing off? For her? I can't help it if your girlfriend's getting excited. - I don't think she's getting excited. - Trying to have a good time. I think you're the only one having a good time. Hey! That's real cute, man. What are you gonna do? Suddenly, you're not so tough. Hello? Honey, can you hear me? Bobby, what did you do? I didn't do this. No. I did. And the next time you feel like showing off, don't. Breaking news. We're coming to you live from Washington... where there's been an attack in the Oval Office of the White House. Details are still coming in, but we have been informed... that the president and vice-president were not harmed. Sources say the attack involved one or more mutants. I think it's time to leave, Professor. Authorities have closed off- I think you're right. Yearrgh! Unh! My opinion? Magneto's behind this. No. I don't think so, Scott. While Eric is capable of organizing something like this from prison... for him it would be irrational. It would only hurt his goal of mutant prosperity. You mean superiority. You're right. If Eric had his way Of course, you know how the government will respond. They'll reintroduce the Registration Act. Or worse. The president could declare a state of emergency. Place every mutant in the country under arrest. Do you think the assassin was working alone? Well, we'll only know that if we find him before the authorities do. I've been trying to track him using Cerebro... but his movements are inexplicably erratic. When I have more exact coordinates... Storm, Jean, I'll need you to take the jet and try and pick him up. It was close, wasn't it? Closer than anyone's admitted. What do you need, William? Just your authorization... for a special operation. Uh, no, thank you, Mr. President. And somehow I thought you were here to talk about school reform. Funny you should say that, Mr. President. Senator. Mr. President. Thank you for having me. Senator Kelly, this is Colonel William Stryker. How do you do? His department has been dealing with the mutant phenomenon... since before my time. As I recall, you were a staunch supporter of the Registration Act, Senator. It seems your ideas on the mutant problem have changed recently. For the best, I hope. So, what are you proposing, Mr. Stryker? Uh, may I, Mr. President? We've managed to gather evidence of a mutant training facility... in the Salem region of upstate New York. Where did you get this information? Interrogation of one of the mutant terrorists... from the Liberty Island incident. Eric? Eric Lehnsherr? You have access to him? Magneto. Yes. We developed the technology that built his plastic prison. - This facility is a school. - Sure it is. What the hell is that? Ajet. - What kind of jet? - We don't know... but it comes up out of the basketball court. If wed been allowed to do our jobs, Mr. President, before this incident All right. Listen. William, you enter, you detain, you question... but the last thing we need to see... is the body of a mutant kid on the 6:00 news. Mr. Stryker. Senator Kelly. This is Yuriko, my personal assistant. Quite a handshake. What can I do for you? Uh, Eric Lehnsherr's prison. I'd like to arrange a visit if possible. It isn't a petting zoo, Senator. In this conflict, he is the enemy. You're just a spectator. So why don't you sit this one out, all right? Conflict? Mr. Stryker, do you really want to turn this into some kind of war? I was piloting black-ops missions in the jungles of North Vietnam... while you were sucking on your mama's tit at Woodstock, Kelly. Don't lecture me about war. This already is a war. You're dead. You're so dead. You're dead. II don't wanna hurt you. I'm not afraid. Hey. Logan! It's Logan. You miss me, kid? Not really. Mm. How you doing? I'm okay. How are you? Who's this? Oh, this is Bobby. He's my I'm her boyfriend. Call me Iceman. Right. Boyfriend? So how do you guys Well, we're still working on that. Look who's come back. Just in time. For what? We need a baby-sitter. Baby-sitter? Nice to see you again, Logan. - Hi, Logan. - Hi, Jean. Uh, I should go and get the jet ready. Yeah, well, it was good to meet you. Come on. Let's go. Bye, Logan. I'll see you later. - Okay. Storm and I are heading to Boston. We won't be gone long. The professor wants us to track down a mutant who attacked the president. So it was a mutant? You'll be here when we get back unless you plan on running off again. Well, I can probably think of a few reasons to stick around. Find what you were looking for, Logan? More or less. I'll see you boys later. - Be safe, okay? - You too. - Bye. - See ya. Aren't you gonna welcome me home? Your bike needs gas. Then fill her up. Mr. Laurio. How long can we keep this up? How long is your sentence? Forever. Not necessarily forever, Mr. Lehnsherr. Just until I've got all that I need. Mr. Stryker. How kind of you to visit. Have you come back to make sure the tax-payers' dollars are keeping me comfortable? Ohh! Done. You can go. Now... Mr. Lehnsherr... I'd like to have one final talk... about the house that Xavier built... and the machine called Cerebro. Logan, my tolerance for your smoking in the mansion notwithstanding... continue smoking that in here and you'll spend the rest of your days... under the belief that you're a six-year-old girl. - You'd do that? - I'd have Jean braid your hair. Welcome back. Ooh. You want me to leave? No. Just don't move. These lights represent every living person on the planet. White lights are humans. And these are the mutants. Through Cerebro, I'm connected to them. And they to me. You see, Logan... We're not as alone as you think. I found the base at Alkali Lake. There was nothing there. The broken line represents the path of the mutant who attacked the president. I've been finding it difficult to get a lock on him. Well, can't you just concentrate harder? If I wanted to kill him, yes. There. Looks like he's finally stopped running. I need you to read my mind again. Logan... I'm afraid the results will be the same as before. We had a deal. The mind is not a box that can be simply unlocked and opened. It's a beehive with a million different compartments. Spare me the lecture. I have no doubt that your amnesia, your adamantium skeleton, the claws... are all somehow connected. But, Logan... sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself. I promise you we'll talk again when I return. Oh. If you will be kind enough to watch over the children tonight... Scott and I are going to visit an old friend. I'm sending coordinates of where the mutant seems to have settled for now. Soon as you find him, bring him back to the mansion. Let's hope he cooperates. Yes. For his sake. Good luck. Stryker, William. What are you doing in here? Estoy tirando la basura. Garbage. These are the coordinates. He's a teleporter. - Must be why the professor had trouble locking onto him. We're not here to hurt you! We just wanna talk! - Are you bored yet? - Oh, yeah. Sure you don't wanna come down? - You have him? - He's not going anywhere. Are you? Please don't kill me. I didn't mean to harm anyone. Now why would people have gotten that impression? What's your name? Wagner. Kurt Wagner. There was so much shooting... such fear... and then there was only pain. I could see it all happening... but I couldn't stop myself. It was like a bad dream. Perhaps He is testing me. And before you were in the White House... what do you remember? Nothing. I was here. Jean. I'd rather get him back to the professor. The professor? Did you do these yourself? Yes. And what about this? I need you to read my mind again. I'm afraid the results will be the same as before. He'll be indestructible. His entire skeleton Adamantium. Sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself. Wolverine. No memory. He'll have no memory. A dozen tourists in the White House during the attack... are still being held for questioning. Best tasting food. A machine that's so darn easy ...president will address the nation For the White House assassin, following hundreds of- Can't sleep? - How can you tell? - 'Cause you're awake. Right. How about you? I don't sleep. Hey. Doesn't anybody sleep around here? Apparently not. Got any beer? This is a school. So that's a ""no""? Yeah, that's a ""no. "" Got anything other than chocolate milk? There should be some soda in that small cupboard. Thanks. No problem. I'll take him from here. It's all right, Scott. Nice shades. Thanks. Charles Xavier. Have you come to rescue me? Sorry, Eric. Not today. To what do I owe the pleasure? The assassination attempt on the president What do you know about it? Nothing. Only what I read in the papers. You really shouldn't have to ask, Charles. What's happened to you? I've had frequent visits from William Stryker. You remember him, don't you? William Stryker. His son, Jason, was once a student of yours, wasn't he? Yes. Years ago. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to help him... at least not in the way that his father wanted. And now you think that taking in the Wolverine... will make up for your failure with Stryker's son. How long you been here? Couple years. And your parents just sent you off to mutant school? Actually, my parents think this is a prep school. Oh, I see. I suppose lots of prep schools have their own dorms, campuses Jets. So you and Rogue, huh? Yeah. It's not what you think. I'd like it to be, but it's just It's just that it's not easy... when you wanna be closer to someone... but you can't. You know, I've seen how you look at Dr. Grey. Excuse me? Nothing. You haven't told him about his past, have you? I've put him on the path. Logan's mind is still fragile. Is it? Or are you afraid of losing one of your precious X-Men... old friend? Eric, what have you done? I'm sorry, Charles. I couldn't help it. What have you told Stryker? Everything. The war has begun. Scott! You should've killed me when you had the chance! But now and then... every mother needs to get away. Without her, the babies are helpless. Sensing danger, the mother rat races home. The babies can't even see the killer. And someone uninvited is coming to dinner. She arrives too late for one baby. The centipede was deadly. Hi. - What is it? - Shh, shh. You picked the wrong house, bub. You all right? Stay here. Come on! Run! Move, move, move! This way. Let's go. Come on! Go, go, go! Run! Run! John! Hey. Where's Rogue? I don't know. I gotta find her. Hey! Come on! Here. Take her. Hurry! Go on. Get in. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Let's go! Come on! Hey. Take him. He's stunned. I can help you. Help them. Rogue! Bobby! This way. Come on. Everybody, follow me up here. Move! Move! Go! Go! Come on. Let's go. Come on. This way. This is it. Logan! You wanna shoot me? Shoot me! Don't shoot him! Not yet. Wolverine? Well, I must admit, this is certainly the last place... I'd expect to find you. How long has it been? Fifteen years? You haven't changed one bit. Me, on the other hand Nature. Wait! Wait! You guys, we gotta do something. They're gonna kill him. - He can handle himself. Let's go. - Bobby! Please. I didn't realize Xavier was taking in animals even animals as unique as you. Who are you? Don't you remember? No! No! Logan, come on. Let's go. Logan. Go! I'll be fine. But we won't. Go. Keep going. All right. Get in. Get in! I'm driving. Hey. Maybe next time. This is Cyclops's car. Oh, yeah? What the hell was that back there? Stryker. His name is Stryker. Who is he? I can't remember. Zone one clear. Roger that. Here. This is yours. I don't like uncomfortable silences. What are you doing? I don't think that's the CD player. Whoa. Sit back. Where we going? Storm and Jean are in Boston. We'll head that way. - My parents live in Boston. - Good. Sergeant? Most of the mutants escaped through a series of tunnels that weren't in our schematics. We have several in custody. How many? Six, sir. Welcome, Professor. Take what we need, gentlemen. Look, I just think all this anti-mutant protesting... underscores the genuine growing concern among most Americans. I think mutant registration But why stop there? Maybe it would be easier to round up mutants by the truckload. Or maybe you'd like all-out war, Mr. Shaw. Oh, please. Turn that shit off, Lou. Lot on your mind? Mr. Laurio? I'm Grace. You want another beer? Of course you do. You're really aggressive. Yes, I am. Oh, I I've never hooked up with a girl like you before. I know. It's, uh, kinda dirty in here, don't you think? That's the idea. Velcro. Nice. Bottom's up. I certainly hope so. Bottom's up. - William. - Please, Xavier, don't get up. I call it the neural inhibitor. It keeps you outta here. What have you done with Scott? Don't worry. I'm just giving him a little reeducation. Of course, you know all about that, don't you? William, you wanted me to cure your son. But mutation is not a disease. You're lying! You were more frightened of him than I was. You know, just one year after Jason returned from your school... my wife You see he resented us. He blamed us for his condition. So he would toy with our minds... projecting visions and scenarios into our brains. Well, my wife, in the end She took a power drill to her left temple... in an attempt to bore the images out. My boy, the great illusionist. For someone who hates mutants... you certainly keep some strange company. Oh, they serve their purpose... as long as they can be controlled. You arranged the attack on the president. You didn't even have to read my mind. You know, I've been working with mutants as long as you have, Xavier... but the most frustrating thing I've learned... is that nobody really knows how many even exist... or how to find them except you. Unfortunately, this little potion won't work on you, will it? You're much too powerful for that. Instead, we'll go right to the source. Allow me to introduce mutant 143. The fluid secreted by his brain acts as a mind-controlling agent. But that's only where it begins. Jason. Oh, my God, William. This is your son. What have you done to him? No, Charles! My son is dead... just like the rest of you. Mom? Dad? Ronny? Is anybody home? I'll try and find you some clothes. Don't burn anything. Hey. I found some of my mom's old clothes. I think they're from before I was born. Groovy. Hello. Come on, Jean. Where are you? These are my grandmother's. Thanks. You won't hurt me. Wow. I'm I'm sorry. It's okay. Mmm. Hey, Ronny. Next time you Who the hell are you? Uh Bobby. Honey, aren't you supposed to be at school? Bobby, who is this guy? - Uh, this is Professor Logan. There's something I need to tell you. You're clear. Have a nice sleep, Lehnsherr? There's something different about you, Mr. Laurio. Yeah. I was having a good day. No. No, it's not that. - Sit down. - No. Sit your ass down. What could it be? What are you doing? Ahh. There it is. Too much iron in your blood. Mr. Laurio, never trust a beautiful woman... especially one who's interested in you. So, uh... when did you first know you were a A- A mutant? Would you cut that out? You have to understand, We thought Bobby was going to a school for the gifted. Bobby is gifted. We know that. We just didn't realize he was We still love you, Bobby. It's just this mutant problem is a little - What mutant problem? - Complicated. What exactly are you a professor of, Mr. Logan? Art. Well, you should see what Bobby can do. Bobby. I can do a lot more than that. Oh. Ronny! This is all my fault. Actually... they discovered that males are the ones who carry the mutant gene and pass it on... so it's his fault. ...the assassination attempt... 911. Please state your emergency. I need the police. There are people in our house. They won't let us leave. Authorities refused to comment... but it's believed that a manhunt for several fugitives from the facility... is now underway. Nobody's responding. I can't get a signal. Why don't you take a break? I'll keep trying. Right. So, what are they? They are angelic symbols... passed on to mankind by the Archangel Gabriel. They're beautiful. How many do you have? One for every sin... so quite a few. You and Miss Grey are schoolteachers? Yes. At a school for people like us... where we can be safe. Safe from what? Everyone else. You know, outside of the circus, most people were afraid of me. But I didn't hate them. I pitied them. Do you know why? Because most people will never know anything... beyond what they see with their own two eyes. Well, I gave up on pity a long time ago. Someone so beautiful should not be so angry. Sometimes anger... can help you survive. So can faith. Storm, I found an active com device. Where? Oh, it's for me. Bobby... have you tried not being a mutant? No one's left, Jean. Soldiers came. What about the children? Some of them escaped. I'm not sure about the rest. We haven't been able to reach the professor or Scott either. Where are you, Logan? Boston, with Bobby Drake's family. - Okay. We're on our way. - And Storm? Make it fast. We have to go now. Why? Now! Logan, what's wrong? Drop the knives and put your hands in the air. What's going on here? - Ronny. I said drop the knives. Open the door! Break it. Turn around. - Up against the wall. - Okay! This is just a misunderstanding. Put the knives down. I can't. Look. Oh! All right, the rest of you, on the ground now. Look, kid, I said on the ground. We don't want to hurt you, kid. You know all those dangerous mutants you hear about on the news? I'm the worst one. Look out! Guten tag. Who the hell is this? Kurt Wagner. But in the Munich circus, I was known as ""the Incredible Night crawler"" - Aw, save it. Storm? We're outta here. Whoa. Jason, stop it! It's all right. You can come out. Have they gone? Yes. - Where are all the other students? - I don't know. Well, then, we'll have to find them, won't we? We'll use Cerebro. Come on. How far are we? We're actually coming up on the mansion now. I've got two signals approaching. Coming in fast. Unidentified aircraft, you are ordered to descend to 20,000 feet. Return with our escort to Hanscom Air Force base. You have 10 seconds to comply. - Wow. Somebody's angry. - I wonder why. We are coming up alongside you to escort you to Hanscom Air Force base. Lower your altitude now. Repeat, lower your altitude to 20,000 feet. This is your last warning. They're falling back. They're marking us. - What? - They're gonna fire. Hang on! I gotta shake 'em. - Please don't do that again. - I agree. Don't we have any weapons in this heap? Warning, warning, warning. Warning, warning, warning, warning, warning. Warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning. Warning, warning, warning - Everybody okay back there? - No. Oh, my God. There's two of 'em. There's one more. Jean Oh, God! Rogue! No! - Jean? - It's not me. When will these people learn how to fly? Thank you. Bitte schn. - Can you hear what they're saying? - I could take a closer look. His name is Colonel William Stryker... and he invaded your mansion for one purpose: He wanted Cerebro. Or enough of it to build one of his own. But that doesn't make any sense. Stryker would need the professor to operate it. Which I think is the only reason my old friend is still alive. Oh, my God. Now, what are you all so afraid of? While Cerebro is working, Charles' mind is connected... to every living person on the planet. If he were forced to concentrate hard enough on a particular group let's say, mutants, for example - he could kill us all. - Wait a minute. How would Stryker even know where to find Cerebro in the first place? Because I told him. I helped Charles build it, remember? Mr. Stryker has powerful methods of persuasion. Even against a mutant as strong as Charles. So who's this Stryker anyway? He's a military scientist. He spent his whole life trying to solve the mutant problem. If you want a more intimate perspective, why don't you ask Wolverine? You don't remember, do you? William Stryker, the only other man I know who can manipulate adamantium. The metal on your bones. It carries his signature. - But the professor- - The professor trusted... you were smart enough to discover this on your own. He gives you more credit than I do. - Why do you need us? - Mystique has discovered plans of a base... that Stryker's been operating out off or decades. We know that's where he's building the second Cerebro... but we don't know where this base is... and I believe one of you might. - The professor already tried. - Once again, you think it's all about you. Oh... hello. I didn't mean to snoop. Just try and relax. I'm sorry. Stryker's at Alkali Lake. That's where the professor sent me. There's nothing left. There's nothing left on the surface, Logan. The base is underground. Hey. Hey. You okay? Yeah. You sure? How we doing? Not good. It'll take four or five hours before I can get it off the ground. That's not what I meant. I'm just worried about Scott. I'm worried about you. That was some display of power up there. Obviously, it wasn't enough. Hey, hey. Come on. All right? I love him. Do you? Girls flirt with the dangerous guy, Logan... they don't take him home. They marry the good guy. I could be the good guy. Logan, the good guy sticks around. Jean. Please. Please. Don't make me do this. Do what? This. Excuse me. They say you can imitate anybody... even their voice. Even their voice. Then why not stay in disguise all the time? You know, look like everyone else. Because we shouldn't have to. Look No one's ever left a scar quite like you. What do you want, an apology? You know what I want. But what do you want? What do you really want? I want you to get out. Jesus. Why don't we get uniforms? Yeah, where's ours? They're on order. Should arrive in a few years. We love what you've done with your hair. Hey, hey. Come on. Let's go. So, they say you're the bad guy. Is that what they say? That's a dorky-looking helmet. What's it for? This dorky-looking helmet is the only thing that's gonna protect me... from the real bad guys. - What's your name? - John. What's your real name, John? Pyro. Quite a talent you have there, Pyro. I can only manipulate the fire. I can't create it. You are a god among insects. Never let anyone tell you different. Sir, the machine has been completed to all specifications. Good. Ow! If I may ask, sir, why are we keeping the children here? I'm a scientist, Sergeant Lyman. When I build a machine, I wanna make sure that it's working. All right, this is a topographic map of the dam. This is the spillway. You see these density changes in the terrain? They're tire tracks. That's the entrance. Mm-hmm. And this shows the depth of the ice that's covering the ground. Now, this is recent water activity. If we go in there, Stryker could flood the spillway. Can you teleport inside? No. I have to be able to see where I'm going... otherwise I could wind up inside a wall. I'll go. I have a hunch he'll want me alive. Wolverine, whoever goes into the dam needs to be able to operate the spillway mechanism. What do you intend to do? Scratch it with your claws? I'll take my chances. But I won't. Sir, there's someone coming down the spillway. I'm flooding it. Wait. Stryker! Stryker! Well, look who's come home. Move and you're dead. The one thing I know better than anyone is my own work. Seal the room. Shoot it. Seal the room Step away! We have a metamorph loose. Could be anybody. Anybody? What Can you override the spillway mechanism? Everything's controlled from inside that room. That's why the doors are so thick. Oh, really? Get some charges! Blow the doors open! Take out these cameras! I'm in. She's good. You have no idea. Fire in the hole. Move, move, move. Sergeant, she's opened the spillway doors. More mutants have entered the base. How many? We've lost coms. There's some sort of electrical interference Sergeant Lyman, gather the rest of your men and meet me outside Cerebro. You carry on. When I come back, I want this door open all the way! Welcome, Professor. - Don't leave me alone, please? - You can come inside. Have you found it? A large portion of energy from the dam has been diverted to this chamber. Cerebro. There it is. Can you shut it down from here? No. Come. There's little time. Not without us. Oh, my God. The children. - Kurt, will you come with me? - Yes. Where are they? They're being held in a containment cell one level down. Stryker. All right... we'll get the children and meet you at Cerebro. Okay. I'll try to find Scott and the professor. - Will you be all right without us? - Yeah. I'll be fine. Where's Logan? He's gone. You, set up a perimeter. Move, move. Jason. It's time. Time to find our friends. Is it time to find our friends? - All of them. - All of them? - All of the mutants. - All the mutants? - Everywhere. - Everywhere? That's right. Every one of them? Oh, yes. Good. It's time to bring it to an end. Make me proud. Just don't move. Kill anyone who approaches... even if it's me. Go! I'll take care of him! This is one lover's quarrel we cannot get involved in, my dear. Scott! Scott? Help us! Anybody! - Listen. Help! Get us out of here. - Julie? - Storm. Get us out of here! Okay, we're coming. Scott! Scott, don't do this! Jean, no, no, no. It's okay. It's okay. It's me. Scott. I'm so sorry. I thought I'd lost you. Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I could see you, but I couldn't stop myself. I tried. I'm sorry. I love you so much. I love you. My leg. Okay, easy. Easy. Scott... something's wrong. My God. No! Have you found the mutants yet? Have you found all of them? I'm trying. There are so many of them. Then concentrate. Concentrate. The tricky thing about adamantium is... that if you ever manage to process... its raw, liquid form, you gotta keep it that way. Keep it hot. Because once the metal cools, it's indestructible. But you already know that. I used to think you were one of a kind, Wolverine. I was wrong. Holy shit. That's it. Whoa. Where do you think you're going? I'm sick of this kid's table shit. I'm going in there. John, they told us to stay here. You always do as you're told? Find all the mutants. Find them. Find all the mutants. Find them all. Each one. All of them. Good. Kill them. Concentrate. Concentrate harder. Now, find them all. Find all the mutants. You, concentrate harder. Kill them. Kill them all. Kill them. Cerebro. We're too late. Eric, hurry! That's strange. How does it look from there, Charles? Still fighting the good fight? From here, it doesn't look like they're playing by your rules. Maybe it's time to play by theirs. There's been a change of plan. Good-bye, Charles. There's been a change of plans. Now find them. Find them all the humans. Find all the humans. Every one. How does it feel, bub? Why did you come back? You cut me open. You took my life! You make it sound as if I stole something from you. As I recall, it was you who volunteered for the procedure. Who am I? You... are just a failed experiment. If you really knew about your past... what kind of person you were... the work we did together- People don't change, Wolverine. You were an animal then. You're an animal now. I just gave you claws. What the hell is that? What is it? The dam's ruptured. It's gonna flood water into the spillway. It's trying to relieve the pressure. It's too late. In a few minutes, we'll all be underwater. Come with me, and I'll tell you everything you want to know. You can't help your friends. They're as good as dead, Wolverine. You're a survivor, always have been. Oh, I thought I was just an animal... with claws. If we die, you die. Aaah! There are no exits that way, Wolverine! Find all the humans. Every one. Find them. Find all the humans. Find them all. - What is this? - Cerebro. Storm. Jean. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. What's happening? Professor's still in there... with another mutant. He's trapped in some kind of illusion. Oh, my God. Magneto's reversed Cerebro. It's not targeting mutants anymore. Who is it targeting? - Everyone else. Impossible. Everybody stand back. Scott, no. His mind is connected to Cerebro. Opening the door could kill him and everyone his mind is linked to. Wait. Kurt, I need you to take me inside. - Storm, who is this guy? Who are you? - My name is Kurt Wagner... but in the Munich circus He's a teleporter. I told you, if I can't see where I'm going I have faith in you. Don't believe anything you see in there. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, they will be done on Earth As it is in heaven. Hello. What are you looking for? Professor, can you hear me? - You've got to stop Cerebro now. - Who are you talking to? No. Don't move. But she's just a little girl. No, she's not. I've got my eyes on you. Mr. Stryker. Funny, we keep running into each other. Mark my words, it'll never happen again. Kurt, it's about to get very cold in here. I'm not going anywhere. What are you doing? Find all the humans. Kill them. Every single one. Find all the humans. Focus. Focus. Find all the humans. Stop it! Jason. He's going to be so angry at me. Logan. Logan, where are you? We have to get out through the spillway. You don't want to go that way. Trust me. Come on. There's another way out of here. The helicopter was right here! I will take him. Okay. It's okay, Rogue. It's okay. You can let go, honey. - Let go. - Go. I'll be fine. You sure? Yeah. Who has the answers, Wolverine? Those people? That creature in your arms? Huh? I'll take my chances with him. One day, someone will finish what I've started, Wolverine! One day! Scott, we've got to get to Washington. I fear this has gone beyond Alkali Lake. Bobby. I got 'im. You okay? I am now. - What's wrong? - Vertical thrusters are off line. So fix 'em. I'm trying. - Has anyone seen John? - Pyro? Where the hell is he? He's with Magneto. They're functioning, but I don't know how long they're going to last. I'm trying to override. It's not responding. - Come on! - Oh, no, we've lost the power. There's power in the fuel cells, we're just not connecting. Okay. I've Scott, the engine control system is shot. - Which part? - All of it. Where's the override? - It's gonna take some time. Storm, we need some kind of external power. - Jean? - Wait. Where is Jean? She's outside. No, we're not leaving! Lower the ramp! Storm, lower it! I can't. She's controlling the jet. You, get her, now! She's not letting me. Damn it! I know what I'm doing. - This is ... the only way. Jean, listen to me. Don't do this. Good-bye. - Oh, no! No! - No! No! She's gone. - She's gone. - Don't you say that! We gotta go back. She's gone. No! No. She's gone. She's gone. She's She's gone. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of the death... I will fear no evil... for thou art with me. Today I've been given an opportunity to shed light on recent occurrences... from the attack that ended in this office Good morning. Good morning to the unexplained phenomenon that swept the Earth... nearly annihilating our way of life. Good morning, Mr. President. - Good morning. Do we like this word ""annihilating""? Good morning. Good morning, Mr. President. Thank you. Mr. President, we're live in five, four, three, two My fellow Americans, in this time of adversity... we are being offered a moment... a moment to recognize a growing threat within our own population... and take a unique role in the shape of human events. Did we just lose the feed? Are we still live? Good morning, Mr. President. Please, don't be alarmed. We're not going to harm anyone. - Who are you people? - We're mutants. My name is Charles Xavier. Please, sit down. - I'd rather stand. - Rogue. These files were taken from the private offices of William Stryker. How did you get this? Well, let's just say I know a little girl who can walk through walls. I've never seen this information. I know. Then you also know I don't respond well to threats. Mr. President, this is not a threat. This is an opportunity. There are forces in this world, both mutant and human alike... who believe that a war is coming. You will see from those files that some have already tried to start one... and there have been casualties. Losses on both sides. Mr. President... what you were about to tell the world is true this is a moment. A moment to repeat the mistakes of the past... or to work together for a better future. We're here to stay, Mr. President. The next move is yours. We'll be watching. Mr. President. You know... even when Jean was a student... she was always hesitant about her powers. Always looking to others. Feeling that in some way she was left behind. Do you think Could we have done more to save her? In the past, she may have let us. There had to be another way. Why did she leave the plane? Because she made a choice. Yes, come on in. Hey, hey. Listen, she did make a choice. It was you. Professor? Is everything all right? Yes, I think it will be. Now, tell me, have any of you read a book... by an English novelist named T.H. White... called The Once and Future King? No? Well Mutation. It is the key to our evolution. It is how we have evolved from a single-celled organism... into the dominant species on the planet. This process is slow... normally taking thousands and thousands of years. But every few hundred millennia... evolution leaps forward., - Is this on? - INTERVIEWER: That's fine. I can break through walls, I just can't... - INTERVIEWER: That's fine. - I can't get this on. INTERVIEWER: Mr. Incredible... Do you have a secret identity? Every superhero has a secret identity. I don't know a single one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time? Of course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, know what I mean? Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something. I said, ""Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego."" I mean, you tell me you're a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good. No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. ""I just cleaned up this mess. ""Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?"" INTERVIEWER: I could get to that point. - ""Please?"" - INTERVIEWER: We're not finished. Sometimes I think I'd just like the simple life, you know? Relax a little and raise a family. Settle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game! I'm up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don't think so. I don't think so. We interrupt for a bulletin. A high-speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway, traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave. Yeah, I've got time. Mr. Incredible. - What is it, ma'am? - My cat, Squeaker, won't come down. Certainly. I suggest you stand clear. There could be trouble. No, he's quite tame. Let go now. Thank you, Mr. Incredible. You've done it again. - You're the best. - No, I'm just here to help. (OVER RADIO) All units. We have a tour bus robbery... Tour bus robbery. I've still got time. Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker. - Cool! Ready for take-off! - What the... - Who are you supposed to be? - I'm IncrediBoy. What? No. You're that kid from the fan club. (STAMMERING) Brophy. Brody. Buddy! Buddy! My name is IncrediBoy. I've been nice, I've stood for photos, signed every scrap of paper you pushed at me... No, don't worry about training me. I know your moves, crime fighting style, favorite catch phrases, everything! I'm your number one fan! BUDDY: Hey! Hey, wait! INCREDIBLE: You know, you can tell a lot about a woman by the contents of her purse, but maybe that's not what you had in mind. Hey, look... Elastigirl. Mr. Incredible. - It's all right. I've got him. - Sure, you've got him. - I just took him out for you. - Sure, you did. - His attention was on me. - A fact I exploited to do my job. - My job, you mean. - A simple thank you will suffice. Thanks, but I don't need any help. Whatever happened to ""ladies first""? Well, whatever happened to equal treatment? Look, the lady got me first. - Well, we could share, you know. - I work alone. Well, I think you need to be more flexible. Are you doing anything later? I have a previous engagement. Now, you just stay here. They usually pick up the garbage in an hour. - FROZONE: Hey, Incredible! - Hey, Frozone! - Shouldn't you be getting ready? - I still got time. WOMAN: He's gonna jump! SANSWEET: I think you broke something. With counseling, I think you'll come to forgive me. Wait a minute. (COUGHING) Bomb Voyage. Mr. Incredible...! BUDDY: And IncrediBoy! VOYAGE: IncrediBoy? Aren't you curious about how I get around so fast? I have rocket boots. - Go home, Buddy. Now. - What? Little oaf...! Can we talk? You always say be true to yourself, but you never say which part to be true to. Well, I've finally figured out who I am. I am your ward. IncrediBoy! And now, you have officially carried it too far, Buddy. This is because I don't have powers, isn't it? Not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. I invented these. I can fly. Can you fly? Fly home, Buddy. I work alone. And your outfit is totally ridiculous! Just give me one chance! I'll show you. I'll go get the police. - Buddy, don't! - It'll only take a second, really. No, stop! There's a bomb! Let go, you're wrecking my flight pattern. - I can do this if you let go! - Will you just... - I'm trying to help! Stop! - Let go of my cape! Take this one home. And make sure his mom knows what he's been doing. I can help you. You're making a mist... The injured jumper. You sent paramedics? They picked him up. The blast in that building was caused by Bomb Voyage who I caught robbing the vault. We might nab him if we set up a perimeter. - He got away? - Well, yeah. - Skippy here made sure of that. - IncrediBoy. You're not affiliated with me! Holy smokes, I'm late. Listen, I've gotta be somewhere. - What about Bomb Voyage? - Any other night, I'd go after him, but I really gotta go. Don't worry. We'll get him! Eventually! - Is the night still young? - You're very late. - How do I look? Good? - The mask. You still got the mask. Showtime. Robert Parr, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? You're late. When you asked if I was doing anything later, I didn't realize you'd forgotten. I thought it was playful banter. - It was. - Cutting it close, don't you think? You need to be more flexible. I love you, but if we're gonna make this work, you've gotta be more than Mr. Incredible. You know that. Don't you? ...so long as you both shall live? - I do. I pronounce this couple husband and wife. (PEOPLE CHEERING AND WHISTLING) As long as we both shall live. No matter what happens. Hey, come on. We're superheroes. What could happen? ANNOUNCER: In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for saving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet, who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed suit against the famed superhero in Superior Court. Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved. He didn't want to be saved. The injury received from Mr. Incredible's ""actions,"" - causes him daily pain. - I saved your life! You didn't save my life! You ruined my death. LAWYER: My client has no comment. ANNOUNCER: Another suit was filed by victims of the El train accident. Incredible's court losses cost the government millions. And opened the floodgates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over. It is time for their secret identity to become their only identity. Time for them to join us, or go away. ANNOUNCER: Under public pressure, and the financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits, the government quietly initiated the Superhero Relocation Program. The supers were granted amnesty from responsibility for past actions, in exchange for the promise to never again resume hero work. Where are they now? They are living among us. Average citizens, average heroes. Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place. Denied? You're denying my claim? I don't understand. I have full coverage. I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson, but our liability is spelled out in paragraph 17. - It states clearly... - (STAMMERING) I can't pay for this. Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr. I'm calling to celebrate a momentous occasion. We're now officially moved in. Yeah, well, that's great, honey. The last three years don't count because... Because I finally unpacked the last box. Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha. HELEN: Why do we have so much junk? Listen, I've got a client. Say no more. Go save the world one policy at a time, honey. Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids. See you tonight. Bye, honey. Excuse me. Where were we? (SOBBING) I'm on a fixed income, and if you can't help me, I don't know what I'll do. All right, listen closely. I'd like to help you, but I can't. I'd like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to Norma Wilcox on... (WHISPERING) Norma Wilcox. W-I-L-C-O-X. On the third floor. But I can't. I also do not advise you to fill out and file a WS2475 form with our legal department on the second floor. I wouldn't expect someone to get back to you quickly to resolve the matter. I'd like to help, but there's nothing I can do. Oh, thank you, young man. (SHOUTING) Sorry. I know you're upset! (WHISPERING) Pretend to be upset. Parr! You authorized payment on the Walker policy! Someone broke into their house, Mr. Huph. - Their policy covers... - I don't wanna know about it. Don't tell me about it. Tell me how you're keeping Insuricare in the black. Tell me how that's possible, with you writing checks to every Harry Hardluck and Sally Sobstory that gives you a phone call. (OVER PA) Morning break is over. Morning break is over. I appreciate you coming down here, Mrs. Parr. What's this about? Has Dash done something wrong? He's a disruptive influence and he openly mocks me in front of the class. - He says. - Look, I know it's you! - He puts thumbtacks on my stool. - You saw him do this? Well... Not really. No. Actually, not. Oh, then how do you know it was him? I hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I've got him. See? You see? You don't see it? He moves! Right there! Wait, wait! Right there! Right as I'm sitting down! I don't know how he does it, but there's no tack before he moves and after he moves, there's a tack. Coincidence? I think not! - Bernie... - Don't ""Bernie"" me. (SCREAMING) This little rat is guilty! You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble. You're letting him go again? He's guilty! You can see it on his smug little face. Guilty, I say, guilty! Dash, this is the third time this year you've been sent to the office. We need to find a better outlet. A more constructive outlet. Maybe I could, if you'd let me go out for sports. Honey, you know why we can't do that. I promise I'll slow up. I'll only be the best by a tiny bit. Dashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is temptation. You always say, ""Do your best."" But you don't really mean it. Why can't I do the best that I can do? Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else. Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of. - Our powers made us special. - Everyone's special, Dash. Which is another way of saying no one is. BOY: Rydinger, where you headed? - GIRL: Hi, Tony. - Hey. - ""Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?"" - That's kind of funny. ""Hey, Tony, do you play football?"" BOY: Tony, I thought we were gonna go swimming. He looked at me. DASH: Come on, Violet! (HORNS HONKING, PEOPLE YELLING) (MUTTERING) Darn kids. Sitting on the driveway... Oh, great. Mom. - You're making weird faces again. - No, I'm not. You make weird faces, honey. - Do you have to read at the table? - Uh-huh. Yeah. Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes! Bob, could you help the carnivore cut his meat? Dash, you have something you wanna tell your father about school? Well, we dissected a frog. Dash got sent to the office again. - (DISTRACTED) Good. Good. - No, Bob, that's bad. - What? - Dash got sent to the office again. - What? What for? - Nothing. He put a tack on the teacher's chair, during class. Nobody saw me. You could barely see it on the tape. They caught you on tape and you still got away with it? Whoa! You must have been booking. How fast were you going? We are not encouraging this. I'm not, I'm just asking how fast... - Honey! - (CRASH) Great. First the car, now I gotta pay to fix the table... What happened to the car? Here. I'm getting a new plate. So, how about you, Vi? How was school? - Nothing to report. - You've hardly touched your food. - I'm not hungry for meatloaf. - Well, it is leftover night. We have steak, pasta... What are you hungry for? - Tony Rydinger. - Shut up. - Well, you are. - I said, shut up, you little insect. - Well, she is. - Do not shout at the table. - Honey! - BOB: Kids! Listen to your mother. She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf. That's it! Stop it! DASH: You're gonna be toast! HELEN: Stop running in the house. HELEN: Sit down! - Hey, no force fields! - You started it. You sit down! You sit down! Violet! ""Simon J. Paladino, ""longtime advocate of superhero rights, is missing""? - Gazerbeam. - HELEN: Bob! It's time to engage. Do something! Don't just stand there! - I need you to intervene! - You want me to intervene? Okay. I'm intervening! Violet, let go of your brother. JACK-JACK: Hello? BOB: Get the door. - Hey, Lucius! - Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack. - Ice of you to drop by. - Ha! Never heard that one before. (GARGLING) Lucius! LUCIUS: Whoa! LUCIUS: Ha, ha. DASH: Oh! - I like it when it shatters. - I'll be back later. - Where are you two going? - It's Wednesday. Bowling night. Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius. Will do. Good night, Helen. Good night, kids. Don't think you've avoided talking about the principal's office. Your father and I are still gonna discuss it. I'm not the only kid who's been sent to the office. Other kids don't have superpowers. - Now, it's perfectly normal... - What do you know about normal? What does anyone in this family know about normal? - Now, wait a minute, young lady. - We act normal. I wanna be normal. The only normal one is Jack-Jack, and he's not even toilet trained. DASH: Lucky. I meant about being normal. LUCIUS: So now I'm in deep trouble. I mean, one more jolt of this death ray and I'm an epitaph. Somehow I managed to find cover. What does Baron Von Ruthless do? - He starts monologuing. - He starts monologuing. He starts this prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him. How inevitable my defeat is, the world will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada. - Yammering. - Yammering. LUCIUS: I mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he won't shut up. RADIO: Municiberg, we have a 23-56... 23-56, what is that? - Robbery? - This is just sad. - Want to catch a robber? - No. Tell you the truth, I'd rather go bowling. Look, what if we actually did what our wives think we're doing? Just to shake things up. MIRAGE: He's not alone. The fat guy's still with him. They're just talking. - What are we doing here? - Protecting people. - Nobody asked us. - You need an invitation? I'd like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this, and... - You remember Gazerbeam? - There was something in the paper. - He had trouble with civilian life. - When did you see him? I don't see anyone from the old days. Just you. - And we're pushing our luck as it is. - Come on. It was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this... - RADIO: We have a report on a fire... - A fire. We're close! - (YELLING) Yeah, baby! - We're gonna get caught. BOB: Fire! Yeah! LUCIUS: Is that everybody? BOB: Yeah. - It better be. - Can't you put this out? I can't lay down a layer thick enough! It's evaporating too fast! - What's that mean? - It means it's hot. - I'm dehydrated, Bob. - You're out of ice? You can't run out. You can use water in the air. There is no water in this air! What's your excuse, run out of muscle? I can't smash walls. The building's getting weaker. - It's gonna come down on top of us. - I wanted to go bowling! All right! Stay right on my tail! This is gonna get hot! BOB: Yeah. Uh-oh. Oh, good. - (ALARM SOUNDS) - (LUCIUS GROANS) That ain't right. - We look like incompetent bad guys! - You can get water out of the air. Freeze! - I'm thirsty. - I said freeze! I'm just getting a drink. - You've had your drink. Now... - I know. I know. Freeze. Police officers! LUCIUS: That was way too close. We are not doing that again. (OVER RADIO) Verify you want to switch targets? Over. Trust me. This is the one he's been looking for. - I thought you'd be back by 11:00. - I said I'd be back later. I assumed you'd be back later. If you came back at all, - you'd be ""back later"". - Well, I'm back, okay? Is this rubble? (WITH MOUTH FULL) It was just a little workout. Just to stay loose. You know how I feel about that. Darn you! We can't blow cover again. The building was coming down anyway. What? You knocked down a building? It was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was coming down. Have you been listening to the police scanner again? I performed a public service. You act like that's a bad thing. It is a bad thing, Bob! Uprooting our family again, so you can relive the glory days is a bad thing. It's better than acting like they didn't happen! Yes! They happened! But this, our family, is what's happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! I can't believe you don't want to go to your own son's graduation. It's not a graduation. He's moving from fourth to fifth grade. - It's a ceremony! - It's psychotic! They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity but if someone is exceptional... This is not about you, Bob. It's about Dash. You want to do something for Dash? Let him actually compete. - Let him go out for sports! - I will not be made the enemy! - You know why we can't do that. - Because he'd be great. This is not about you! All right, Dash. I know you're listening. Come on out. Vi? You, too, young lady. Come on. Come on out. It's okay, kids. We're just having a discussion. VIOLET: Pretty loud discussion. But that's okay. What's important is that Mommy and I are a team. - We're united, uh, against forces of... - Pigheadedness? - I was gonna say evil. - We're sorry we woke you. Everything's okay. Go back to bed. It's late. - Good night, Mom. Night, Dad. - Good night. In fact, we should all be in bed. (ON PHONE) Request claim on claim numbers 158183... HUPH: Haven't you got him yet? Where is he? PA: Mr. Huph would like to talk to you in his office. - Now? - Now. Sit down, Bob. I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy. - Ask me why. - Okay. Why? Why what? Be specific, Bob. Why are you unhappy? Your customers make me unhappy. What, you've gotten complaints? Complaints I can handle. What I can't handle is your customers' inexplicable knowledge of Insuricare's inner workings! They're experts. Experts, Bob! Exploiting every loophole, dodging every obstacle! They're penetrating the bureaucracy! - Did I do something illegal? - No. - We shouldn't help our customers? - The law requires that I answer no. - We're supposed to help people. - (YELLING) Help our people! Starting with our stockholders. Who's helping them out, huh? HUPH: You know, Bob, a company... Is like an enormous clock. ...is like an enormous... Yes. Precisely. HUPH: It only works if all the little cogs mesh together. Now, a clock needs to be cleaned, well-lubricated and wound tight. The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs that fit, that cooperate by design. (CHUCKLING) I'm being metaphorical, Bob. Know what I mean by cooperative cogs? Bob? Bob? Look at me when I'm talking to you, Parr. - That man out there, he needs help. - Don't change the subject. - We're discussing your attitude. - He is getting mugged! - Well, let's hope we don't cover him. - I'll be right back. Stop right now or you're fired! Close the door. Get over here, now. I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy. - He got away. - Good thing, too. You were this close to losing your... Uh-oh. (OVER PA) Please report to operating room 722 immediately. - How is he? - He'll live. - I'm fired, aren't I? - You think? - What can I say, Rick? - Nothing you haven't said before. - Someone was in trouble. - Always. - I had to do something. - Every time you say that, it's a month and a half of trouble for me. Hundreds of thousands of taxpayer's dollars. - I know. - We pay to keep the company quiet. We pay damages, erase memories, relocate your family. Every time it gets harder. Money, money, money. We can't keep doing this. We appreciate what you did in the old days, but those days are over. From now on, you're on your own. Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you, you know, for old times' sake. I can't do that to my family. Everyone just got settled. I'll make it work. Thanks. Take care of yourself. BOB: What are you waiting for? I don't know. Something amazing, I guess. (SIGHS) Me, too, kid. Huh? ""Hold still""? COMPUTER: Match, Mr. Incredible. Room is secure. Commence message. MIRAGE: Hello, Mr. Incredible. Yes, we know who you are. Rest assured, your secret is safe with us. My name is Mirage. We have something in common. According to the government, neither of us exist. Please pay attention, as this message is classified and will not be repeated. I represent a top secret division of the government, designing and testing experimental technology, and we have need of your unique abilities. Something happened at our testing facility. - HELEN: Honey! - Huh? What? - HELEN: Dinner's ready. - Okay. ...it is contained within an isolated area, it threatens to cause incalculable damage to itself and our facilities, jeopardizing hundreds of millions of dollars... HELEN: Is someone in there? - It's the TV, trying to watch. - Because of its sensitive nature... - HELEN: Stop. It's time for dinner. - One minute! If you accept, your payment will be triple your current annual salary. Call the number on the card. Voice-matching will ensure security. The supers aren't gone, Mr. Incredible. You're still here. You can still do great things. Or you can listen to police scanners. Your choice. You have 24 hours to respond. Think about it. COMPUTER: This message will self-destruct. Uh-oh. (FAMILY SHOUTING IN ANOTHER ROOM) You are one distracted guy. Am I? I don't mean to be. I know you miss being a hero and your job is frustrating. I just want you to know how much it means to me that you stay at it anyway. - Honey? About the job? - What? - Something's happened. - What? - The, uh... - What? The company is sending me to, uh, a conference. - A conference? - (STAMMERING) Out of town. I'm gonna be gone for a few days. They've never sent you to a conference before. This is good, isn't it? (HESITATING) Yes. You see? They're finally recognizing your talents. - You're moving up. - Yes. - Honey! This is wonderful! - Yes, it is. (OVER PHONE) Hello? This is Mr. Incredible. I'm in. The Omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot. Its artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem it's confronted with. And, unfortunately... Let me guess. It got smart enough to wonder why it had to take orders. We lost control. Now it's loose in the jungle, threatening our facility. We've had to evacuate all personnel from the island for their own safety. How am I going in? The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate an air drop from 5,000 feet. Its cloaking devices make it difficult to track. We're pretty sure it's on the southern half of the island. One more thing. Obviously it represents a significant investment. You want me to shut it down without destroying it. You are Mr. Incredible. I've got to warn you, it's a learning robot. Every moment you fight it increases its knowledge of how to beat you. Shut it down. Do it quickly. Don't destroy it. - And don't die. - Great. Thanks. Showtime. Huh? - Hmm. - (LOUD CRASH) Uh-oh. Oh, my back! - (LOUD CRACK) - Oh! Surprising. We must bring him back. Sound the all clear, and invite him to dinner. SYNDROME: (BARELY AUDIBLE) Most important, keep things light. Praise him. Make him feel like we appreciate his abilities. Am I overdressed? Actually, you look rather dashing. BOB: I take it our host is... MIRAGE: I'm sorry. He won't be dining with us. He hopes you'll understand. Of course. I do usually make it a point to know who I'm working for. He prefers a certain amount of anonymity. Surely, you of all people understand that. I was just wondering, of all the places to settle down, why live... With a volcano? He's attracted to power. So am I. - It's a weakness we share. - Seems a bit unstable. I prefer to think of it as misunderstood. (CHUCKLING) Aren't we all? Volcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth. Everything at the table was grown right here. - How does it compare? - Everything's delicious. - Jeez. - HELEN: Hurry, honey. Or you'll be late for work. - Have a great day, honey. - Thanks. - Help customers, climb ladders... - Bring bacon. All that jazz. You have an appointment? I'm an old friend. I just wanted to... - All visitors are required... - E: Go check the electric fence. What is it? Who are you? What do you want? My God, you've gotten fat. Come in. Come, come. Yes, things are going quite well. Quite well. My God, no complaints. But, you know, it is not the same. Not the same at all. Weren't you in the news? Some show in Prayge... Prague? Milan, darling. Milan. E: Supermodels. Nothing super about them. Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures with poofy lips who think only about themselves. Feh! I used to design for gods. But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh? I was surprised to get your call. E, I just need a patch job. Hmm. This is megamesh. Outmoded, but very sturdy. And you've torn right through it! What have you been doing, Robert? Moonlighting hero work? Must have happened a long time ago. I see. This is a hobo suit, darling. You can't be seen in this. I won't allow it! - Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now? - What do you mean? You designed it. I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now. You need a new suit. That much is certain. A new suit? Where the heck am I gonna get a new suit? You can't! It's impossible! I'm far too busy. So ask me now, before I again become sane. Wait. You want to make me a suit? You push too hard, darling! But I accept. - E: It will be bold. Dramatic! - Yeah. Heroic! Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy! Oh! He had a great look! Oh, the cape and the boots... E: No capes! - Isn't that my decision? - Do you remember Thunderhead? E: Tall, storm powers. Nice man. Good with kids. - Listen, E... - November 15th of '58. E: All was well, another day saved when his cape snagged on a missile fin. Thunderhead was not the brightest bulb... Stratogale! E: April 23rd, '57. Cape caught in a jet turbine. You can't generalize about these things. E: Meta-Man. Express elevator. Dynaguy, snag on takeoff. Splashdown, sucked into a vortex. No capes! Now, go on. Your new suit will be finished before your next assignment. You know I'm retired from hero work. As am I, Robert. Yet, here we are. E, I only need a patch job. For sentimental reasons. (SIGHS) Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit. - You're the best of the best, E. - Yes, I know, darling. I know. BOB: Don't answer it, honey, I got it! - Hello? - We have a new assignment for you. MIRAGE: How soon can you get here? BOB: I'll leave tomorrow morning. - MIRAGE: See you there. - Goodbye. Who was that, honey? The, uh, office? Another conference. Short notice, but, you know, duty calls. (NERVOUS LAUGH) - HELEN: Bob? - Yeah, what's up, honey? - Ha... Have a great trip. - Thanks, sweetie. - I'll call you when I get there. - I love you. - So much. - I love you, too. SHIP'S COMPUTER: This is your automated Captain. Would you care for more mimosa? - BOB: Don't mind if I do. Thanks. - You're welcome. Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan. Perfect weather for flying. Please fasten your seat belt. We're beginning our descent. MIRAGE: Hello, Mr. Incredible. Nice suit. Thanks. Nice to be back, Mirage. You'll be briefed on your assignment in the conference room at 2:00. - D Wing, room A-113. - 2:00. Got it. See you there. (GASPS) Edna. - I'd like to speak to Edna, please. - E: This is Edna. - E? This is Helen. - Helen who? Helen Parr? You know... Elastigirl? Darling! It's been such a long time after all these years! So long! (STAMMERING) It's been a while. There's only one person Bob would trust to patch his supersuit. That's you. Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it? Much better than those horrible pajamas he used to wear. They are finished. When are you coming to see? - HELEN: I'm calling about... - Don't make me beg. - I won't do it, you know. - Beg? No, I'm calling about suit. (STAMMERING) Bob's suit! I'm calling about Bob's suit. You come in one hour, darling. I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye. Hmm. SYNDROME: It's bigger! It's badder! Ladies and gentlemen, it's too much for Mr. Incredible! It's finally ready. You know, I went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you, but, man, it wasn't good enough! After you trashed the last one, I had to make some major modifications. Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it. I mean, after all, I am your biggest fan. - Buddy? - My name is not Buddy! And it's not IncrediBoy either! That ship has sailed. All I wanted was to help you. I only wanted to help! And what did you say to me? Fly home, Buddy. I work alone. SYNDROME: It tore me apart. But I learned an important lesson. You can't count on anyone. Especially your heroes. I was wrong to treat you that way. I'm sorry. See? Now you respect me, because I'm a threat. That's the way it works. There's a lot of people, whole countries who want respect. And they will pay through the nose to get it. How do you think I got rich? I invented weapons. Now I have a weapon only I can defeat. And when I unleash it, I'll get... (LAUGHING) You sly dog! You got me monologuing. I can't believe it. It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy. I save the best inventions for myself. Am I good enough now? Who's super now? I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and... Oh, brilliant! All right, try this one on for size, big boy. Gazerbeam. BOB: Kronos? SCANNER: Life reading negative. Mr. Incredible terminated. E: This project has completely confiscated my life, darling. Consumed me as only hero work can. My best work, I must admit. Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die. - E, I just... - I did Robert's suit, and it turned out so beautiful, I had to continue. It's great to see you, but I have no idea what you're talking about. - I just... - Yes, words are useless. Gobble, gobble, gobble. Too much of it, darling. Too much! That is why I show you my work. That is why you are here. Edna Mode. And guest. Come. Sit. - Cream and sugar? - Thanks. - I started with the baby. - Started? E: Shh! Darling! I cut it a little roomy for the free movement. The fabric is comfortable for sensitive skin, E: And can also withstand a temperature of over 1000 degrees. Completely bulletproof. And machine washable, darling. That's a new feature. What on earth do you think the baby will be doing? Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling. Luck favors the prepared. I didn't know the baby's powers, so I covered the basics. - Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers. - No? Well, he'll look fabulous anyway. Your boy's suit I designed to withstand enormous friction without heating up or wearing out. A useful feature. Your daughter's suit was tricky. I finally created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does. Your suit can stretch as far as you can, without injuring yourself, and still retain its shape. Virtually indestructible, yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton. As an extra feature, each suit contains a homing device, giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button. Well, darling? What do you think? What do I think? Bob is retired! I'm retired! Our family is underground. You helped my husband resume secret hero work behind my back? Well, I assumed you knew, darling. Why would he keep secrets from you? He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't. Men at Robert's age are often unstable. - Prone to weakness. - What are you saying? Do you know where he is? - Of course. - Do you know where he is? GUARD: Hey, hey. We got a man down! GUARD 2: Come on, let's go. GUARD 2: Are you okay? What happened? (OVER RADIO) Break surveillance and engage. Continuing sweep... - (OVER PHONE) Insuricare. - Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr. Bob Parr is my husband. I was wondering if you could give me the number of the hotel he's staying at? - The number I have is no good. - Mr. Parr no longer works here. What do you mean? He's on a business trip. A company retreat. My records say he was terminated almost two months ago. So, you don't know where he is. Would you like to find out? (SOBBING) I am such an idiot. I let this happen, you know. The new sports car, the getting in shape, the blond hair, the lies. Yes, he attempts to relive the past. Now I'm losing him! What'll I do? What'll I do? What are you talking about? You are Elastigirl! My God! Pull yourself together. What will you do? Is this a question? Show him you remember that he is Mr. Incredible, and you will remind him who you are! Well, you know where he is. Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win! And call me when you get back, darling. I enjoy our visits. There's lots of leftovers that you can reheat. Make sure Dash does his homework. And both of you, get to bed on time. I should be back tonight. Late. You can be in charge that long, can't you? Yeah. But why am I in charge again? Nothing. Just a little trouble with Daddy. You mean Dad's in trouble, or Dad is the trouble? I mean either he's in trouble, or he's going to be. What's that? Where'd you get that, Mom? You made a cool outfit? Hey, are those for us? We all get cool outfits? Dash! You come back here this moment! Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back. I know this is short notice, but I was hoping that I could... - What are these? - Look, I'm The Dash! - The Dash likes. - HELEN: Just a second. - Take that off before somebody sees. - You're packing one just like it. - Are you hiding something? - Please. I'm on the phone... - Dash! - This is yours. It's specially made. - What's going on? - You're not coming! I gotta pack! What makes you think it's special? I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it? Snug, I'm calling in a solid you owe me. - (OVER PHONE) What do you need? - A jet. What do you got that's fast? Let me think. Island approach. India Golf niner-niner checking in. VFR on top. Over. Island tower, this is India Golf niner-niner requesting vectors to the initial. Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl. You're overreacting. Everything's fine. They're just all getting coffee. At the same time. Yeah. You, sir, truly are ""Mr. Incredible."" I was right to idolize you. I always knew you were tough, but tricking the probe by hiding under the bones of another super? Oh, man! I'm still geeking out about it! And then you had to just go and ruin the ride. I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help? (MOCKING) ""Help me, help me."" Lame, lame, lame. All right, who did you contact? Contact? What are you talking about? I am referring to last night at 23:07 hours while you were snooping around. You sent out a homing signal. I didn't know about the homing device. And now a government plane is requesting permission to land here. Who did you contact? I didn't send for a plane. Play the transmission. - HELEN: India Golf checking in. - Helen! So you do know these people. Well, then, I'll send them a little greeting. - VIOLET: Ow! - Violet! It's not my fault. Dash ran away, I knew I'd get blamed for it. That's not true! You said, ""Something's up with Mom. We have to find out what."" ...and it's not my fault! - Hundred percent all-yours idea! Wait a minute. You left Jack-Jack alone? - Of course we got a sitter. - We got someone, Mom. - We wouldn't do that. - Thanks a lot! All right, well, who'd you get? You don't have to worry about one thing. I've got baby-sitting wired. I've taken courses, learned CPR, - excellent marks and certificates. - Kari. I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps because leading experts say Mozart makes babies smarter. - Kari... - The beauty is they don't have to listen 'cause they're asleep! I wish my parents played Mozart because half the time I don't know what anyone's talking about. Kari, I really don't feel comfortable with this. I'll pay you for your trouble, but I'd rather call a service. There's really no need, Mrs. Parr. I can totally handle anything this baby can dish out. (COOING) Can't I, little baby? I can handle it. - KARl: Who can handle it? - (BEEPING) India Golf niner-niner transmitting in the blind guard. Disengage. Repeat, disengage. Repeat, disengage. - Friendlies... - No! Call off the missiles. I'll do anything. Too late. Fifteen years too late. Friendlies two-zero miles south-southwest of your position. Angels 10. Track east. Disengage. Vi! Put a force field around the plane. You said not to use our powers. I know what I said. Listen to what I'm saying now! Disengage. Repeat, disengage! Mom? HELEN: Violet! Mayday. India Golf niner-niner is buddy-spiked. Abort! There are children aboard. - HELEN: There are children aboard! - No! Put a field around us now! I've never done one that big. Do it now! Abort, abort, abort! Brace yourselves! - KIDS: Mom! - Everybody calm down. I'll tell you what we're not gonna do. We're not gonna panic, we're not... Look out! - Oh, my God! Whose idea was this? - What are we gonna do? We're dead! We're dead! - It blew up! - We survived but we're dead! Stop it! We are not gonna die! Both of you will get a grip. Or so help me I will ground you for a month! Understand? We have a confirmed hit. Target was destroyed. Ah, you'll get over it. I seem to recall you prefer to ""work alone."" Release me. Now! Or what? I'll crush her. That sounds a little dark for you. Well, go ahead. It'll be easy. Like breaking a toothpick. (LAUGHING) Show me. SYNDROME: I knew you couldn't do it. Even when you have nothing to lose. You're weak. And I've outgrown you. Those were short-range missiles. Land-based. That way is our best bet. You want to go toward the people that tried to kill us? - If it means land, yes. - Do you expect us to swim there? I expect you to trust me. What a trooper. I'm so proud of you. Thanks, Mom. I think your father is in trouble. If you haven't noticed, we're not doing so hot either. I'm going to look for him. And that means you're in charge until I get back, Violet. - What? - You heard her. Put these on. Your identity is your most valuable possession. Protect it. And if anything goes wrong, use your powers. - But you said never to use... - I know what I said! Remember the bad guys on those shows you used to watch on Saturday mornings? Well, these guys are not like those guys. They won't exercise restraint because you're children. They will kill you if they get the chance. Do not give them that chance. - Mom? - Vi, I'm counting on you. - There's... - I'm counting on you. Be strong. Dash, if anything goes wrong, I want you to run as fast as you can. - As fast as I can? - As fast as you can. Stay hidden. Keep each other safe. I'll be back by morning. VIOLET: Mom! Mom, what happened on the plane. I'm sorry. (STAMMERING) I wanted to help. When you asked me to... I'm sorry. Shh. It isn't your fault. It wasn't fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you. But things are different now. And doubt is a luxury we can't afford anymore, sweetie. You have more power than you realize. Don't think. And don't worry. If the time comes, you'll know what to do. (LAUGHS) It's in your blood. - He's not weak, you know. - What? Valuing life is not weakness. Hey. Look, if you're talking about what happened in the containment unit, I had everything under control. And disregarding it is not strength. I called his bluff, sweetheart, that's all. I knew he wouldn't have it in him to actually... Next time you gamble, bet your own life! Okay, okay, okay. A rocket? Hey! Well, not that this isn't fun, but I'm gonna go look around. What do you think is going on here? You think we're on vacation? Mom and Dad's lives could be in jeopardy. Or worse, (WHISPERING) their marriage. Their marriage? So, the bad guys are trying to wreck Mom and Dad's marriage. Forget it. You're so immature. - I'm gonna go look around. - Mom said to stay hidden. I'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh. (ECHOING) Cool! (OVER RADIO) Roger. We are ready for launch. - DASH: Vi, Vi! - What did you do? (OVER RADIO) ETA two-niner. Over. TCI clear. Condition yellow. Status norm. Not responding to IFF. IRCM reads negative. - Bob. - What? I didn't say anything. ROBOT: Identification, please. Hey! - Hey, Violet! Come here, look. It talks! - What? What? There. That one. Voice key incorrect. ""Voice key""? Voice key incorrect. Wait a second. - What do we do? - Run! - Where are we going? - Away from here! PA: Intruder alert. - There isn't much time. - No, there isn't. - In fact, there's no time at all. - (CHOKING) - Please... - Why are you here? How can you possibly bring me lower? What more can you take away from me? (CHOKING) Family survived the crash. They're here on the island! They're alive? - Helen? - Hello. You must be Mrs... - She was helping me to escape. - No. That's what I was doing. Let go of me! Let go, you lousy, lying, unfaithful creep! How could I betray the perfect woman? Oh, you're referring to me now? Where are the kids? - They triggered the alert. - What? - Security's in the jungle. Get going. - Our kids are in danger? If you suspected danger, why'd you bring them? They stowed away. You're not striking the proper tone. GUARD: Think they're supers? Dash, remember what Mom said. - What? - GUARD 2: Stop talking! GUARD 3: Hold it! Freeze! VIOLET: Dash, run! - What? - VIOLET: Run! - They're supers! - Get the boy! Show yourself! Hey! DASH: Ha, ha! I'm alive. Yeah! DASH: Uh-oh. I should've told you I was fired, I admit it. But I didn't want you to worry. You didn't want me to worry? We're running for our lives through some godforsaken jungle. You keep trying to pick a fight, but I'm just happy you're alive. GUARD: I know you're there, Little Miss Disappear. You can't hide from me. - There you are. - DASH: Hey! Don't touch my sister! - How are you doing that? - I don't know! Whatever you do, don't stop! Mom! Dad! Hey! HELEN: Kids. - You're all right. - You're all right. - We were so worried. - I thought I'd never see you again. BOTH: I love you. DASH: Wow. VIOLET: Whoa. Time out! What have we here? Matching uniforms? Oh, no! Elastigirl? You married Elastigirl? Whoa! And got busy! It's a whole family of supers. Looks like I've hit the jackpot! Oh, this is just too good! - (ON TV) The ship's unique design... - (ON TV) There were no fatalities... Huh? Huh? Oh, come on! You gotta admit, this is cool. SYNDROME: Just like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically, do some damage. Throngs of screaming people! And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day! I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were! You mean you killed off real heroes so that you could pretend to be one? Oh, I'm real. Real enough to defeat you! And I did it without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers. I'll give them heroics. I'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen! And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes. Everyone can be super. (CHUCKLING) And when everyone's super no one will be. Fire at will! (ON TV) It's overwhelming the tanks. BOB: I'm sorry. This is my fault. I've been a lousy father. Blind to what I have. So obsessed with being undervalued - that I undervalued all of you. - Dad? Shh. Don't interrupt. So caught up in the past that I... You are my greatest adventure. And I almost missed it. I swear, I'm gonna get us out of this safely if I... Well, I think Dad has made some excellent progress today but I think it's time we wind down now. We need to get back to the mainland. I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in. Straight ahead. Where are all the guards? Go, go! GUARD: Hey, every time they run, you take a shot. HELEN: This is the right hangar, but I don't see any jets. - A jet's not fast enough. - What's faster than a jet? How about a rocket? - Great! I can't fly a rocket. - VIOLET: You don't have to. Use the coordinates from the last launch. Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed the password by now. - How do I get into the computer? - MIRAGE: Say please. - Honey? - HONEY: What? - Where is my supersuit? - HONEY: What? Where is my supersuit? - HONEY: I put it away. - Where? - HONEY: Why do you need to know? - I need it! HONEY: Don't you think about running off doing no derrin'-do. We've been planning this dinner for two months! - The public is in danger! - HONEY: My evening's in danger! Tell me where my suit is, woman! We are talking about the greater good. HONEY: ""Greater good""? I am your wife! I'm the greatest good you are ever gonna get! Run! My baby! - MAN: The supers have returned! - Is that Fironic? - MAN: Fironic? - No, Fironic has a different outfit. No, no, I'm a new superhero! I'm Syndrome! All right, stand back. Someone needs to teach this hunk of metal a few manners. Ha, ha! - Are we there yet? - We get there when we get there. BOB: How you doing, honey? HELEN: Do I have to answer? Kids, strap yourselves down like I told you. BOB: Here we go, honey. Ready, Violet? Ready? Now! This is gonna be rough. Robot's in the financial district. Which exit? - Traction Avenue. - That'll take me downtown. - I take Seventh, don't I? - Don't take Seventh! - Great, we missed it. - Ask how to get there, I told you. - Traction. - That'll take me downtown. Get in the right lane! Signal! - Not Traction! - You're gonna miss it! Is everybody okay back there? - Super-duper, Dad! - (LAUGHING) Let's do that again. Wait here and stay hidden. I'm going in. While what? I watch helplessly from the sidelines? - I don't think so. - I'm asking you to wait with the kids. And I'm telling you not a chance. You're my husband. I'm with you for better or worse. I have to do this alone. - What is this to you? Playtime? - No. - So you can be Mr. Incredible again? - No! - Then what? - I'm not... - Not what? - I'm not strong enough. - This will make you stronger? - Yes. No! That's what this is? Some sort of workout? I can't lose you again! I can't. Not again. I'm not strong enough. If we work together, you won't have to be. I don't know what'll happen. We're superheroes. What can happen? Vi! Dash! No! Violet? - Dad! - Go, go! - I'm okay, Mom. Really. - Stay here, okay? Frozone! BOB: Yeah! Bob! Hey! Syndrome's remote! The remote controls the robot! Throw it, throw it! Go long! Got it! Honey, take out its guns! FROZONE: Gotcha! Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote! A remote? A remote that controls what? The robot? It's coming back! - That wasn't right. - Give me that! We can't stop it. The only thing hard enough to penetrate it is itself. It's getting closer! - It doesn't work! - HELEN: Kids! FROZONE: It's not doing anything. - Try to buy us some time. - Try the one next to it. Honey! Wait a minute. Press that button again! No, the other one! The first one! First button! Got it! - It's getting closer! - Look out! - Get out of here! - We're not going anywhere. - BOB: Press the button! - Not yet! - FROZONE: Helen! - What are you waiting for? A closer target! You got one shot! Everybody duck! Hey, Zone. Huh? No! Did you see that? That's the way to do it. - That's old school. - Yeah. No school like the old school. - Just like old times. Oh! - Just like old times. Yeah. Hurt then, too. We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets. If he even sneezes, we'll be there with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs. The people of this country are indebted to you. Does this mean we can come out of hiding? Let the politicians figure that one out. I've been asked to assure you we'll take care of everything else. You did good, Bob. Hi, this is Kari. I have a question about Jack-Jack... Come on. We're in a limo. Hey, you're wearing your hair back? - (STAMMERING) Yeah, I just... Yeah. - It looks good. - Thanks, Dad. - That was cool when you threw that car! Not as cool as you running on water. That was sweet when you snagged that bad guy with your arm and whiplashed him into the other guy. Sweet! - I'm trying to listen to messages. - KARl: It's me. Jack-Jack is fine, but weird things are happening. Jack-Jack's still fine, but I'm getting really weirded out! When are you coming back? ...aced those guys that tried to kill us! That was the best vacation ever! I love our family. KARl: I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr! Put that down! Stop it! You need to call me. I need help, Mrs... Bob, listen to this. KARl: I'm gonna call the police... Hi, this is Kari. Sorry for freaking out, but your baby has special needs. Thanks for sending a replacement. I didn't call a replacement. Shh. The baby is sleeping. You took away my future. I'm simply returning the favor. Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor. Supportive, encouraging. Everything you weren't. And in time, who knows, he might make a good sidekick. He's getting away, Bob! We have to do something now. What's happening? - Stop him! Throw something! - I might hit Jack-Jack. Throw me. Bob, throw me! No! This isn't the end of it! I will get your son, eventually. I'll get your son! Oh, no. Look at Mommy, honey. Don't look down. Mommy's got you. Everything is all right. That's my girl. Does this mean we have to move again? LITTLE BOY: Oh, man. That was totally wicked! Do we have to have cheerleaders at the track meet? - What is that all about? - I always thought it was more... - Hey. - Hey. - You're, uh, Violet, right? - That's me. - See you, Vi. - You look different. I feel different. Is different okay? Hey, different is... (CLEARS THROAT) Different is great. (STAMMERING) Would you... - Yeah? - Do you think maybe... - (STAMMERING)... you and I... - Yeah? - Do you... - Shh. I like movies. I'll buy the popcorn. Okay? (STAMMERING) A movie. There you go. Yeah. - Wait, so Friday? - Friday. - Go, Dash, go. - Run! BOB: Come on, run! Pick up the pace. ALL: Run! Pull back, pull back! BOB: Pace it. Slow down just a little bit. - Make it close! - Second. BOB AND HELEN: Close second, yeah! BOB: That's my boy! Dash, I'm so proud of you. DASH: I didn't know what the heck you wanted me to do. Behold the Underminer! UNDERMINER: I am always beneath you, but nothing is beneath me! UNDERMINER: I hereby declare war on peace and happiness! Soon all will tremble before me!, Legend tells of a legendary warrior... ...whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend. He traveled the land in search of worthy foes. I see you like to chew. Maybe you should chew on my fist! The warrior said nothing, for his mouth was full. Then he swallowed. And then he spoke. Enough talk. Let's fight! Shashabooey! He was so deadly in fact, that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness. - My eyes! - He's too awesome! - And attractive. - How can we repay you? There is no charge for awesomeness. Or attractiveness. Kablooey! It mattered not how many foes he faced. They were no match for his bodacity! Never before had a panda been so feared! And so loved. Even the most heroic heroes in China, the Furious Five, bowed in respect to this great master. We should hang out. Agreed. But hanging out would have to wait. Because when you're facing the 10,000 demons of Demon Mountain, there's only one thing that matters and that's... Po! Get up! You'll be later for work! What? Po! Get up! Po. What are you doing up there? Nothing. Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress! Po! Let's go! You're late for work. Coming! Sorry, Dad. Sorry doesn't make the noodles. What were you doing up there? All that noise. Nothing. I just had a crazy dream. About what? What were you dreaming about? What was I? I was dreaming about... ...noodles. Noodles? You were really dreaming about noodles? Yeah. What else would I be dreaming about? Careful! That soup is sharp. Oh, happy day! My son, finally having the noodle dream! You don't know how long I've been waiting for this moment. This is a sign, Po. A sign of what? You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup. Then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant! As I took it over from my father, who took it over from his father... ...who won it from a friend in mahjong. Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream. No, it was the dream. We are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins. But, Dad, didn't you ever want to do something else? Something besides noodles? Actually, when I was young and crazy, I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu. Why didn't you? Because it was a stupid dream. Can you imagine me making tofu? Tofu. No! We all have our place in this world. Mine is here, and yours is... I know, is here. No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12 Service with a smile. Well done, students... if you were trying to disappoint me. Tigress, you need more ferocity! Monkey, greater speed. Crane, height. Viper, subtlety. Mantis... - Master Shifu. - What?! It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you. Master Oogway, you summoned me? Is something wrong? Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend? So, nothing's wrong? Well, I didn't say that. You were saying? I have had a vision. Tai Lung will return. That is impossible! He is in prison. Nothing is impossible. Zeng! Fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons, double everything! Tai Lung does not leave that prison! Yes, Master Shifu! One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it. We must do something! We can't let him march on the valley, take his revenge! He'll... Your mind is like this water, my friend. When it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see. But if you allow it to settle... ...the answer becomes clear. The Dragon Scroll. It is time. But who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power? To become the Dragon Warrior? I don't know. Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry. Watch it! Sorry. Suck it up! Sorry. A thousand pardons. What? Master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior! Today! Everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll! We've waited 1,000 years for this! Take the bowl! This is the greatest day in kung fu history! Just go! Po! Where are you going? To the Jade Palace. You're forgetting your noodle cart. The whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them. Selling noodles? But, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I... - Yeah? - I was thinking maybe I... ...could also sell the bean buns. They're about to go bad. That's my boy! I told you that dream was a sign. Yeah. Glad I had it. - I'm a kung fu warrior! - Me, too! - There's spots at the top. - Let's go. Come on. Come on! Almost there. What? No! Oh, no! - Sorry, Po. - We'll bring you back a souvenir. No. I'll bring me back a souvenir. It is an historic day. Isn't it, Master Oogway? Yes, and one I feared I would not live to see. Are your students ready? Yes, Master Oogway. Know this, old friend. Whomever I choose will not only bring peace to the valley... ...but also to you. Let the tournament begin! Let the tournament begin! Yeah. No, no, wait! I'm coming! Wait, wait! Yes! Hey! Open the door! Let me in! Citizens of the Valley of Peace, it is my great honor to present to you... Tigress! Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five! Yeah, the Furious Five! Warriors, prepare! Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole. - Ready for battle! - Yeah. The Thousand Tongues of Fire. Look at that. Hey! Get out of the way! And finally Master Tigress! And believe me, citizens, you have not seen anything yet. I know! Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death. I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us. Citizens of the Valley of Peace, Master Oogway will now choose the Dragon Warrior! Oh, no! No, no, wait! Yeah. Po! What are you doing?! What does it look like I'm doing?! Stop! I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior! But I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream! I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad. I love kung fu! Come on, son. Let's get back to work. OK. Come back! What's going on? Where? What are you pointing? OK. Sorry. I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was. How interesting. Master, are you pointing at me? - Him. - Who? - You. - Me? The universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior! - What? - What?! - What?! - What?! Stop, wait! Who told you to? Master Oogway, wait. That flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to our problem. You were about to point at Tigress and that thing fell in front of her! That was just an accident! There are no accidents. Forgive us, Master. We have failed you. No. If the panda has not quit by morning then I will have failed you. Wait! Wait, wait, wait! I bring a message... ...from Master Shifu. What?! ""Double the guard?!"" ""Extra precautions?!"" ""Your prison may not be adequate?!"" You doubt my prison security?! Absolutely not. Shifu does. I'm just the messenger. I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu. Escape from Chorh-Gom prison is impossible! Impressive, isn't it? It's very impressive. It's very impressive. One way in, one way out. One thousand guards and one prisoner. Yes, except that prisoner... ...is Tai Lung. Take us down. What are you doing? Oh, my. Behold Tai Lung. I'm just gonna wait right here. It's nothing to worry about. It's perfectly safe. Crossbows! At the ready! Crossbows? Hey, tough guy, did you hear? Oogway's giving someone the Dragon Scroll, and it's not gonna be you. Don't get him mad. What's he gonna do about it? I've got him completely immobilized. Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail? I'm good. I've seen enough. I'll tell Shifu he has nothing to worry about. No, he doesn't. I'll tell him that. Can we please go now? Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior! Wait a second! I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm... The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way! Look at this place. Master Flying Rhino's armor, with authentic battle damage! The Sword of Heroes! Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking. The Invisible Trident of Destiny! I've only seen paintings of that painting. No! The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors. Said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu Army. Hello. Have you finished sight-seeing? Sorry, I should have come to you first. My patience is wearing thin. Well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere. - Would you turn around? - Sure. How's it going? How do you get 5,000... Master Shifu! Someone... broke that. But I'll fix it. Do you have some... ...glue? A splinter. So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior? - I guess so. - Wrong! You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until... ...you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll. So, how does this work? Do you have a ladder, or a trampoline, or? You think it's that easy? That I'll just hand you the secret - to limitless power? - No, I... One must first master the highest level of kung fu. And that is impossible if that one is someone like you. Someone like me? Yes, look at you! This fat butt! Flabby arms! Those are sensitive in the flabby parts. And this ridiculous belly. And utter disregard for personal hygiene. Now, wait a minute. That's uncalled for. Don't stand that close. I can smell your breath. Listen, Oogway said I was... The Wuxi Finger Hold. Not the Wuxi Finger Hold! Oh, you know this hold? Developed by Master Wuxi in the Third Dynasty. Then you know what happens when I flex my pinky. - No, no! - You know the hardest part of this? The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards. OK, OK, take it easy. Now listen closely, panda. Oogway may have picked you, but when I'm through with you, I promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't! Are we clear? Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear. Good. I can't wait to get started. - Let's begin. - Wait, wait, wait. What? - Now? - Yes, now. Unless the great Oogway was wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior. Oh, OK, well... I don't know if I can do all of those moves. Well, if we don't try, we'll never know, will we? Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level. What level is that? Well, I'm not a master, but... ...let's just start at zero. Level zero. No. There is no such thing as level zero. - Maybe I can start with that. - That? We use that for training children and propping the door open when it's hot. But if you insist... The Furious Five! You're bigger than your action figures. Except, you, Mantis. You're the same. Go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do. Are they gonna watch, or should I wait till they get back to work? Hit it. OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate. So I'm still digesting. So my kung fu might not be as good as... later on. Just hit it. All right. What you got? You got nothing, 'cause I got it right here. You picking on my friends? Get ready to feel thunder. I'm coming at you with crazy feet. Come on. I'm a blur. You've never seen bear style. You've only seen praying mantis. Or monkey style. Or I could come at you snickety-snake. Would you hit it! All right. All right. Why don't you try again? A little harder. How's that? That hurts. This will be easier than I thought. I'm feeling a little nauseous! Those are hard! My tenders. How did I do? There is now a level zero. - There's no words. - No denying that. - There's no words. - No denying that. What was Master Oogway thinking? The poor guy's gonna get himself killed. He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire! When he walks, the very ground shakes! One would think Master Oogway would choose someone who knew kung fu. Yeah, or could at least touch his toes. Or even see his toes. OK. Great. Hi. You're up. I am now. I was just... Some day, huh? That kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Are your biceps sore? I've had a long and rather disappointing day, so... Yeah, I should probably get to sleep now. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. - OK, thanks. It's just... Man, I'm such a big fan! You guys were amazing at the Battle of Weeping River. Outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop. You just... Sorry about that. Look, you don't belong here. I know. I know. You're right. I don't have... I just... My whole life I dreamed of... No, I meant you don't belong here. I mean, in this room. This is my room. Property of Crane. OK. Right, right. So, you want to get to sleep. - Yeah. - I'm keeping you up. We got big things tomorrow. All right. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye. What was that? I didn't say anything. OK. All right. Good night. Sleep well. That seemed a little awkward. Master Tigress! I didn't mean to wake you. - You don't belong here. - Yeah, of course. This is your room. I mean, you don't belong in the Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to kung fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning. Big fan! I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom. Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree. I understand. You eat when you are upset. Upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset. So why are you so upset? I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu. In the history of China. In the history of sucking! Probably. And the Five! Man, you should've seen them! They totally hate me. Totally. How is Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior? I mean, I'm not like the Five. I've got no claws, no wings, no venom. Even Mantis has those... thingies. Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles. Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't noodles. You are too concerned with what was and what will be. There's a saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present. - Oh, no! - What's happening?! To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go! Fire crossbows! Fire! Fire! Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu. - Not going anywhere! Neither is he! - Let go of me! Bring it up! Wait! Bring it back! - He's coming this way! - He won't get far. Archers! We're dead. So very, very dead. Not yet we're not. Now! - Can we run now? - Yes. I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was beginning to think I'd been forgotten. Fly back there and tell them... ...the real Dragon Warrior is coming home. Good morning, Master! Panda! Panda! Wake up! He's quit. What do we do now, with the panda gone? Who will be the Dragon Warrior? All we can do is resume our training and trust that in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed. What are you doing here?! Hi! Good morning, Master! I thought I'd warm up a little. You're stuck. Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck? Nah. This is one of my... Yeah, I'm stuck. - Help him. - Oh, dear. Maybe on three. One, two... ...three. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. - No, really, I appreciate... - Ever. You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night? It takes years to develop one's flexibility! And years longer to apply it in combat! Put that down! The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones. Yeah! Excellent. Let's get started. - Are you ready? - I was born re... I'm sorry, brother. I thought you said you were ready. That was awesome! Let's go again! I've been taking it easy on you, panda. But no more. Your next opponent will be me. All right! Yeah, let's go! Step forth. The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness... ...and make him suffer for it. Oh, yeah! To take his strength and use it against him... ...until he finally falls... ...or quits. A real warrior never quits. Don't worry, Master. I will never quit! If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps. But he will. He's not going to quit, is he? He's not going to quit bouncing, I'll tell you that. I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better. Trust me, it will. It's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this... - Fat? - Fur. I was going to say fur. Sure you were. Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? Look at me. I'm over here. Maybe you should look at this again. Oh, OK. Stop it. Stop! I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all... ...but if I didn't know better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me. I know he can seem kind of heartless... ...but he wasn't always like that. According to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile. - No! - Yes. But that was before. Before what? Before Tai Lung. We're not really supposed to talk about him. Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know. Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung. He was a student. The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu. And then he turned bad, and now he's in jail. He wasn't just a student. Shifu found him as a cub... ...and he raised him as his son. And when the boy showed talent in kung fu... ...Shifu trained him. He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness. It was never enough for Tai Lung. He wanted the Dragon Scroll. But Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused. Outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley. He tried to take the scroll by force. And Shifu had to destroy what he had created. But how could he? Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before. Or since. And now he has a chance to make things right. To train the true Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with you. A big fat panda who treats it like a joke. That is it! Wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve. And may have also stopped his heart. Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner... Inner peace. Would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down?! Inner... Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use some good news right now. Master! Master! I have... It's... It's very bad news. Shifu. There is just news. There is no good or bad. Master, your vision. Your vision was right. Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way. That is bad news... ...if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him. The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior. He wasn't meant to be here! It was an accident. There are no accidents. Yes, I know. You've said that already. - Twice. - Well, that was no accident, either. Thrice. My old friend, the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours, until you let go of the illusion of control. Illusion? Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu. I cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time. But there are things we can control. I can control when the fruit will fall. And I can control... ...where to plant the seed. That is no illusion, Master. Yes. But no matter what you do that seed will grow to be a peach tree. You may wish for an apple or an orange, but you will get a peach. But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung! Maybe it can. If you are willing to guide it. To nurture it. To believe in it. But how? How? I need your help, Master. No, you just need to believe. Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you will believe. I will try. Good. My time has come. You must continue your journey without me. What are you? Wait! Master! You can't leave me! You must believe. Master! Yeah, so I'm like, ""Fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province... ...but you're a lousy tipper."" Really? So how did you get out of there alive? I mean, I didn't actually say that... ...but I thought it... ...in my mind. If he could read my mind, he'd be, like, ""What?"" Order up! Hope you like it. - This is really good! - No, come on. Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient. What do you mean? This is amazing! - You're a really good cook. - I wish my mouth was bigger. Tigress, you've got to try this. It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf and the energy of the universe. I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna need a lot more than dew and universe juice. - What? - Nothing... Master Shifu. Never be the Dragon Warrior unless you lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth! What is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it! Work hard, panda, and maybe someday... ...you will have ears like mine. That's good. Ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good. It's Shifu! Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing? Master Shifu! You think this is funny? Tai Lung has escaped and you're acting like children! - What? - He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him. And I was saying you got no sense of humor. I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung. What? You're serious? And I have to? Master Oogway will stop him, like he did before. Oogway cannot! Not anymore. Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior. - The panda? - Yes, the panda! Master, let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for. No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung. It is his! Where'd he go? You cannot leave! A real warrior never quits. Watch me. Come on. How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs. You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior. You don't believe that. You never believed that. From the beginning, you've tried to get rid of me. Yes! I was. But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine. You're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Then why didn't you quit?! You knew I wanted you gone, yet you stayed. Yeah, I stayed. I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled, it hurt, but it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me. I stayed because I thought, if anyone could change me... ...could make me... not me... ...it was you. The greatest kung fu teacher in all of China! But I can change you! I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will! Come on. Tai Lung is on his way here right now. Even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you... ...gonna change this into the Dragon Warrior? How? How? - How?! - I don't know! I don't know. That's what I thought. This is what you trained me for. Tigress! Don't try and stop me. We're not trying to stop you. What? We're coming with you! What? I eat when I'm upset, OK? No need to explain. I thought you might be Monkey. He hides his almond cookies on the top shelf. Don't tell Monkey. - Look at you. - Yeah, I know, I disgust you. No, I mean, how did you get up there? I don't know. I guess that... I don't know. I was getting a cookie. Yet you are ten feet off the ground. And you have done a perfect spilt. No, this? This is just... ...an accident. There are no accidents. Come with me. I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fuey... ...but could you at least tell me where we're going? You dragged me... ...all the way out here... ...for a bath? Panda... ...we do not wash our pits in the Pool of Sacred Tears. The Pool of... This is where Oogway unraveled the mysteries... ...of harmony and focus. This is the birthplace... ...of kung fu. Do you want to learn kung fu? Yeah! Then I am your master! OK! Don't cry. OK. When you focus on kung fu, when you concentrate... ...you stink. Perhaps that is my fault. I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five. I now see that the way to get through to you... ...is with this. Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry. Good. When you have been trained, you may eat. Let us begin. After you, panda. Just like that? No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike? I vowed to train you, and you have been trained. You are free to eat. Enjoy. Hey! I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling. Hey! You are free to eat. - Am I?! - Are you?! I'm not hungry. Master. Cut it! Where's the Dragon Warrior? How do you know you're not looking at her? You think I'm a fool? I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you! I heard how he fell out of the sky in a ball of fire. That he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen. - Po? - So that is his name. Po. Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary! We've got this. Help her. Monkey! Go! What was I thinking?! Mantis! Now! Shifu taught you well. But he didn't teach you everything. You have done well, panda. Done well? Done well? I've done awesome! The mark of a true hero is humility. But, yes, you have done... ...awesome. Guys? Guys?! They're dead! No, they're breathing. They're asleep? But their eyes are open. We were no match for his nerve attach. He's gotten stronger. Who? Tai Lung? Stronger? He's too fast! Sorry, Po. I thought we could stop him. He could have killed you. Why didn't he? So you could come back and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work. It might. I mean, a little. I'm pretty scared. You can defeat him, panda! Are you kidding? If they can't?! They're five masters. I'm just one me. But you will have the one thing that no one else does. You really believe I'm ready? You are... ...Po. Behold the Dragon Scroll. It is yours. Wait. What happens when I read it? Legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing beat. Really? That's cool. Yes. And see light in the deepest cave. You will feel the universe in motion around you. Can I punch through walls? - Do a quadruple back flip? - Focus. - Will I? - Focus. - Focus. - Oh, yeah, yeah. Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny. Read it and become... ...the Dragon Warrior. It's impossible to open. OK. Come on, baby. Come on now. Thank you. I probably loosened it up for you though. OK, here goes. - It's blank. - What?! - Here, look. - No, I am forbidden to look upon... Blank. I don't... I don't understand. OK. So, like... ...Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all. No. Oogway was wiser than us all. Oh, come on! Face it, he picked me by accident. Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding? But who will stop Tai Lung? He'll destroy everything and everyone. No. Evacuate the valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage. - What about you, Master? - I will fight him. - What? - I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape. But, Shifu, he'll kill you. Then I will finally have paid for my mistake. Listen to me, all of you. It is time for you to continue your journey without me. I am very proud to have been your master. We've got to get them out safely. Come, little one. Let's find your mama. Viper, gather the southern farmers. Mantis, the north. Crane, light the way. Look, it's the Dragon Warrior. Hey, Dad. Po! Good to have you back, son. Good to be back. Let's go, Po. So for our next shop, it's time to face it... ...the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables... ...no longer slices. Also, I was thinking, maybe this time we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in. You like that? Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out. It just wasn't meant to be. Po, forget everything else. Your destiny still awaits. We are noodle folk. Broth runs deep through our veins. I don't know, Dad. Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son. Po... ...I think it's time I told you something I should have told you... ...a long time ago. OK. The secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup. Come here. The secret ingredient is... ...nothing. You heard me. Nothing! There is no secret ingredient! Wait, wait. It's just plain old noodle soup? You don't add some kind of special sauce or something? Don't have to. To make something special, you just believe it's special. There is no secret ingredient. I have come home, Master. This is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master. Oh, yes. You have a new favorite. So where is this Po? Did I scare him off? This battle is between you and me. So, that is how it's going to be. That is how it must be. I rotted in jail for 20 years because of your weakness! Obeying your master is not weakness! You knew I was the Dragon Warrior. You always knew. But when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do? What did you do?! Nothing! You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault! Not your fault?! Who filled my head with dreams?! Who drove me to train until my bones cracked?! Who denied me my destiny?! It was never my decision to make! It is now. Give me the scroll! I would rather die. All I ever did, I did to make you proud! Tell me how proud you are, Shifu! Tell me! Tell me! I have... I have always been proud of you. From the first moment, I've been... ...proud of you. And it was my pride... ...that blinded me. I loved you too much to see what you were becoming... ...what I... ...was turning you into. I'm... I'm sorry. I don't want your apology. I want my scroll! What?! Where is it?! Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll halfway across China by now. You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung. Never. Never. Stairs. Who are you? Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior. You? Him? He's a panda. You're a panda. What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me? Don't tempt me. No. I'm gonna use this. You want it? Come and get it. Finally! That scroll is mine! Lightning! The scroll has given him power! No! Finally! Oh, yes. The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine! It's nothing! It's OK. I didn't get it the first time, either. What? There is no secret ingredient. It's just you. Stop it! I'm gonna pee. Don't. Don't! Don't! You... ...can't defeat me. You... ...you're just a big... ...fat... ...panda! I'm not a big fat panda. I'm the big fat panda. The Wuxi Finger Hold! Oh, you know this hold? You're bluffing. You're bluffing. Shifu didn't teach you that. Nope. I figured it out. Skadoosh. Look! The Dragon Warrior. That's my boy! That big lovely kung fu warrior is my son! Yes! Thanks, Dad. Hey, guys. Master. Master. Master? Master Shifu! Master! Shifu, are you OK?! Po. You're alive. Or we're both dead. No, Master, I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung. You did? Wow. It is as Oogway foretold. You are the Dragon Warrior. You have brought peace... ...to this valley... ...and... ...and to me. Thank you. Thank you, Po. Thank you. Thank you. No! Master! No, no, no, don't die, Shifu, please! I'm not dying, you idiot! Dragon Warrior... ...I am simply at peace. Finally. So, I should stop talking? If you can. Want to get something to eat? Yeah.

Isn't that funnier? It's hysterical, Manny. As long as we're laughing, we won't cry over the box office. Talk about depressing. Twenty girls in feather boas prancing around like circus ponies. That's depressing. I love a good chorus line. -What's this? -It's a play. Who wrote it, Annie? Some guy. Driscoll. Driscoll. From the Federal Theatre. Don't knock it, honey. At least they got an audience. It'll pick up. Isn't that right, Manny? It always does. See you tomorrow. The trick is to start to build right from the back of your throat. Works well out through the nose, too. Have you eaten today? I'm not hungry. Don't worry about me. Hey. You're all I've got. Come on, take me to dinner. Okay. You think the kitchen will still be open on Third? Soup and biscuits. Perfect. Harry, what's going on? -Hey, open up! We work here. -Not anymore, lady. It's all right for you. We haven't had a paycheck in two weeks. How we gonna eat? -They're not getting away with this! -They just did. Ann, it's no use. The show, it's over. It's done. I'm done. I'm leaving, Annie. I'm going back to Chicago. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Annie. Ever since you were small, people been letting you down. You gotta think of yourself now. You should try out for that part. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Every time you reach out for something you care about... fate comes along and snatches it away. But not this time, Annie. Not this time. -Oh, hello, Mr Weston. -Oh, jeez. Look, miss, I told you already, call my office. Leave your rsum with my secretary. Now, why would I want to do that when we can talk about it in person? Because that's what a smart girl would do. But I already sent you my rsum. You returned it unopened. What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very particular about who he works with. Please, just an audition. That's all I'm asking. Jesus, you don't give up, do you? Mr Weston, I know this role backwards. Well, that's too bad, 'cause we just gave the part to someone else. I'm sorry, kid. The play is cast. I know times are tough. You want my advice? Use what you got. You're not bad-looking. A girl like you doesn't have to starve. There's a new place. It just opened. Now listen, princess, this gig ain't the Palace, you understand? Ask for Kenny K. Tell him I sent you. Just play the date, take the money... forget you was ever there. How much more is there? Another five reels. Lights up. This is it? This is what we get for our $40,000, Denham? Another one of your safari pictures? You promised us romantic scenes with Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie! Come on, fellows, you know the deal. We agreed to push Maureen's start date... so she could get her teeth fixed. It's not the principle of the thing, it's the money. Carl, you've been in production for over two months. Trust me, Bruce and Maureen are gonna steam up the screen... once we get them on the ship. What ship? The one that we hired to get to the location. What location? Carl! You're supposed to be shooting on the back lot. Yes, I understand that. But, fellows, we're not making that film anymore... and I'll tell you why. The story has changed. The script has been rewritten. Life intervened. I've come into possession of a map. The sole surviving record of an uncharted island. A place that was thought to exist only in myth. Until now. Whoa, Carl, slow down. Is he asking for more money? He's asking us to fund a wild-goose chase. I'm talking about a primitive world never before seen by man. The ruins of an entire civilisation. The most spectacular thing you've ever seen. That's where I'll shoot my picture. Will there be boobies? Boobies? Jigglies. Jiblonkas. Bazooms. In my experience, people only go to these films... to observe the undraped form of the native girls. What are you, an idiot? You think they asked De Mille if he would waste his time on nudie shots? No! They respected the filmmaker. They showed some class. Not that you'd know what that means, you cheap lowlife! Would you step out for a moment, Carl? Give me that, quick. You won't like it. It's non-alcoholic. Preston, you have a lot to learn about the motion picture business. Don't write him off, fellows. He's hotheaded, sure... but Carl Denham's made some interesting pictures. He's had a lot of near-success. He's a preening self-promoter. An ambitious no-talent. The guy's got ""loser"" written all over him. I understand your disappointment-- He can't direct. -He doesn't have the smarts. -He's washed up. It's all over town. This jumped-up little turd's gonna bankrupt us. The animal footage has value. Sure. Universal are desperate for stock footage. Then sell it! Scrap the picture. We got to retrieve something from this debacle. Get him back in. Mr Denham. I want the cast and crew on the ship within the hour. No, Carl, you can't do this. Tell them the studio pressured us into an early departure. -It's not ethical! -What are they gonna do, sue me? They can get in line. I'm not gonna let them kill my film. You realise that none of the camera equipment is on board? We have no permits, no visas. That's why I have you, Preston. We have no insurance, we have no foreign currency. In fact, we have no currency of any kind. He's there. -Get in there. -Who's gonna pay for the ship? Get in. -You get out of there! Come here! -Step on it! Step on it! Get out! You're finished, Denham! Don't worry, Preston. I've had a lot of practice at this. I'm real good at crapping the crappers. Red Label, 80% proof, to be packed in a crate marked ""lemonade."" You got it. Tell Maureen she doesn't have six hours to put on her face. If she wants to be in this picture, she's gotta be on that boat. She doesn't wanna be in this picture. -Maureen pulled out. -She pulled out? Yesterday. I told you. You said we were shooting in Singapore, right? That's what you told her. Yeah, but we're not shooting in Singapore. God damn it, Preston, all you had to do was look her in the eye and lie. I got to get to a phone, talk to Harlow's people. She's unavailable. Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West? You'll never get her into a size four. You gotta get a girl that'll fit into Maureen's costumes. Fay's a size four. Yes, she is, but she's doing a picture with RKO. Cooper, huh? I might have known. You're not listening. We got to delay the shoot. Shut production down. We can't sail tonight. -Not an option. -Carl. I said I'd find a girl. For God's sake, Preston, think like a winner! Call Jack. I need that goddamn screenplay! Defeat is always momentary. What? Hey! You gonna pay for this? Excuse me. Ma'am, I think you dropped this. Vaudeville, huh? I worked vaudeville once. That is a tough audience. If you don't kill them fast, they kill you. Mr Denham... I want you to know... that I'm not in the habit of accepting charity from strangers. Or, for that matter... taking things that don't belong to me. It was obviously a terrible misunderstanding. It's just that I haven't been paid in a while. That's awful. Anyway, Ann.... May I call you Ann? You wouldn't happen to be a size four, by any chance? No, no. Oh, God, no. You've got me all wrong. Miss Darrow, please. I'm not that type of person at all. What type of person are you? I'm someone you can trust, Ann. I'm a movie producer. Believe me, I am on the level. No funny business. Please sit down. Please. Please. Okay. Ann, I want you to imagine... a handsome explorer bound for the Far East. You're filming in the Far East? Singapore. On board ship, he meets a mysterious girl. She's beautiful, she's fragile, haunted. And she can't escape the feeling that forces beyond her control... are compelling her down a road from which she cannot draw back. It's as if her whole life has been a prelude to this moment... this fateful meeting that changes everything. And sure enough, against her better judgement.... She falls in love. Yes. But she doesn't trust it. She's not even sure if she believes in love. Really? If she loves someone, it's doomed. Why is that? Good things never last, Mr Denham. So you're interested. Good. That's settled, then. Now, I don't wanna rush you, but we are under some time pressure. -Well, I really-- -Ann, I'm telling you... you're perfect. Look at you. You're the saddest girl I've ever met. You're gonna make them weep, Ann. You're gonna break their hearts. See, that's where you're wrong, Mr Denham. I make people laugh, that's what I do. Good luck with your picture. Ann? Miss Darrow, please! I'm offering you money. Adventure, fame, the thrill of a lifetime, and a long sea voyage. You want to read a script? Jack Driscoll's turning in a draft as we speak. Jack Driscoll? Sure. Why? Wait. You know him? No, not personally. I've seen his plays. What a writer, huh? And let me tell you, Ann... Jack Driscoll does not want just anyone starring in this picture. He said to me, ""Carl... ""somewhere out there is a woman born to play this role."" And as soon as I saw you, I knew. Knew what? It was always going to be you. How much do I owe you? Make it a quarter. Keep the change. Is this the moving picture ship? Not exactly. It's actually this one over here. Don't let appearances deceive you. It's much more spacious on board. -ls this all of the equipment? -Yeah. -This is all of it? -Yeah. -We're taking the Bell & Howell? -Yeah. -Good. You got all the lenses? -Sure. - Carl! -Yes! Get it on board, fellows, come on. It's bad, it's bad. They're on their way. I've just had word. -Who? -Men in uniform. The studio called the cops. Englehorn! Cast off! Hoist up the mainsail, raise the anchor... whatever the hell it is you do. We gotta leave! I cannot do that. We are waiting on the manifest. What? Who? English, please. Paperwork, Mr Denham. I'll give you another $1,000 to leave now. You haven't given me the first $1,000 yet. Can we talk about this later? Can't you see we're in the company of a VlP guest? Ma'am. Ann Darrow. So you are ready for this voyage, Miss Darrow? Sure. Nervous? Nervous? No. Why? Should I be? It isn't every woman who would take such a risk. Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her cabin? Wonderful idea. Thank you, Preston. Miss Darrow, if you would just.... Hi. My name is Preston. Carl's assistant. $2,000. It's a deal. Will you take a cheque? Do I have a choice? Please follow me. If there's anything that you.... Excuse me, fellows. If there's anything that you need, please don't hesitate to ask. Oh, Jesus! Jack, you scared me. Listen. If anyone comes to the door, don't open it. You haven't seen me. Say I got depressed and committed suicide. Say I stuck my head down the toilet. -You want one? -No. I can't stay, Carl. I got a rehearsal for which I am now three hours late. -What's this? -It's the script. This is a script? Jack, this is 15 pages. I know, but they're good. You've got 15 good pages there, Carl. I'm supposed to be making a feature-length picture. You told me I had more time. I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go. No, Jack, you can't do this to me. I have a beginning... but I need a middle and an end. I gotta have something to shoot. Look, you got my notes. I got to go, pal. See you. All right, fine. We might as well settle up. You're gonna pay me? I'm not gonna stiff a friend. I've never known you to volunteer cash before. How's $2,000 sound? Sounds great. I thought it might. -Sounds great. -Okay. And voil. Thanks. You've written ""two grand."" So I did. Sorry about that. Let's start from the beginning. ""Two thousand dollars."" It is the 29th, isn't it? Oh, come on, it's the 25th. It's the 25th. God, I'm sorry. It'll just take a sec. Never mind, Carl. Just pay me when you get back. All right. Your cabin is the last on the left, Mr Baxter. And may I just say how excited we are to have you back with us, sir? Be a sport and lend a hand here, would you? Excuse me. I'm trying to.... I gotta get-- Christ! Appreciate the help, fellow. Let me get the door for you. Welcome to your stateroom, sir. Dead slow ahead both, Mr Hayes. Dead slow ahead both, Captain. Oh, Christ! God damn it! I keep telling you, Jack, there's no money in theatre. Oh, no! No! You're much better off sticking with film. I don't do it for the money, Carl. I happen to love the theatre. No, you don't. If you really loved it... you would have jumped. This room very comfortable. Plenty dim light, fresh straw. Jesus. What do you keep down here? Lion, tiger, hippo, you name it. You sell them to zoos? Zoo, circus. Skipper get big money for rare animal. Careful. Camel have bad accident on floor. Stain unremovable. Skipper catch any wild animal you want. He'll do you real good price on white rhino. Choy. My apologies for not being able to offer you a cabin. Have you found an enclosure to your taste? Spoiled for choice. What are you, Mr Driscoll? A lion? Or a chimpanzee? I'll take this one. I told you to lock it up. -Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said-- -Lumpy doesn't give the orders! What are you trying to do? Put the whole ship to sleep? Get them out of here. -Compliments of the chef. -Okay. Oh, Christ. Oh, God. Lamb's brains in walnut sauce. Jimmy. You run those ropes up on deck like I told you? Doing it now, Mr Hayes. How about you return Mr Driscoll's pen first? He don't mean no harm. Thanks. -I'll keep him out of your way. -It's okay. It's just that he likes it down here. It's where I found him four years ago. Stowed away in one of them back cages. His arm was broken in two places. He was wilder than half the animals in here. Still won't tell me where he came from. But it wasn't anyplace good. You got to straighten up. Jimmy. You don't want to be on this ship the rest of your life. -Yes, I do. -No, you don't, Jimmy. You got to be smart. Get yourself educated. Give yourself some options. Take this seriously! I do, Mr Hayes, I do. Look. I've been reading. Where'd you get this? I borrowed it. On long-term loan. Look at this. Look, look. ""Adventures on a tramp steamer."" See? Just like us. It's so nice to meet you, Mr Driscoll. I'm actually quite familiar with your work, yes. Hello, Mr Driscoll. It's so nice to meet you. Actually, I'm quite familiar with your work. I'm a huge fan. I've read everything you've ever written. No, too much. Gonna have the ship's engines all over the dialogue. Seagulls. Camera noise. Wind. Christ knows what else. I don't care, Mike. You're the sound recordist. Make it work. Ann! Come on in. Let me introduce you to the crew. This is Herb, the cameraman. -Delighted to meet you, ma'am. -Likewise. May I say what a lovely dress? Oh, this old thing? I just threw it on. Isn't that one of Maureen's costumes? Now, what does a girl have to do around here to get some breakfast? Lumpy, you heard the lady. Fancy my porridge  la walnuts? Oh, Ann, I don't believe you've met.... Ann? That's all right, Mr Denham. I know who this is. Thrilled to meet you. It's an honour to be a part of this. Gee, thanks. Actually, I'm quite familiar with your work. Really? Yes, and what I most admire... is the way you've captured the voice of the common people. Well, that's my job. I'm sure you've heard this before, Mr Driscoll... if you don't mind me saying... but you don't look at all like your photograph. -Excuse me. -Wait a minute, Ann-- He's so much younger in person. And much better-looking. Ann, stop. Stop right there. You see, I was just afraid that you might be... one of those self-obsessed literary types. -I'm sorry, I'm not-- -You know... the tweedy twerp with his nose in his book and his head up his-- It's nice to meet you, too, Miss Darrow. Good Christ! She's standing at the railing. She doesn't know it yet... but they are sailing towards disaster. You got that? Okay, so she turns... the first mate is staggering towards her. There's a knife sticking out of his back. Wait a sec. We're killing off the first mate? That's assuming she knows who the first mate is. Come on, Jack. It was an honest mistake. Ann is nearsighted. It could have happened to anyone. I was joking, Carl. The point is, she's horrified. She has to look away. And that's when she sees it. Sees what? What? The island. We're filming on an island now? When did this happen? Jack, keep your voice down. I don't want the crew getting spooked. Why would they get spooked? What's it called? All right. It has a local name... but I'm warning you, Jack, it doesn't sound good. They call it Skull lsland. Did you get that? What's wrong with this place? There's nothing officially wrong with it. Because, technically, it hasn't been discovered yet. Okay. All right. So we arrive at this place. S... K... U... L... L... Island. All right, everyone, from the top! And action! I think this is awfully exciting! I've never been on a ship before. And I've never been on one with a woman before. I guess you don't think much of women on ships, do you? No, they're a nuisance. -Well, I'll try not to be. -Just being around is trouble. Cut! It's great. Bruce, wonderful performance. You can relax for 10 minutes. That was very natural. I felt moved. What do you think, Driscoll? Dialogue's got some flow now, huh? It was pure effluence. I beefed up the banter. Try to resist that impulse. It's just a little bit of humour, bud. What are you, a Bolshevik or something? Actors. Travel the world, but all they ever see is a mirror. Good legs. Sea legs. Well, you know, sea legs. Yeah. Not that you don't have good legs. Just making conversation. Jesus. Miss Darrow! About the scene today with you and Bruce-- I know it wasn't what you wrote... but Mr Baxter felt very strongly that when a man likes a woman... he must ignore her. And if things turn really hostile, then.... No? Interesting theory. I know. I should have.... It wasn't what I had intended, but-- I'm sorry. I was.... And you made it your own. I was nervous. It was funny, actually. You were funny. Please don't say another word. Good night. Miss Darrow. You don't have to be nervous. Thank you. Let's take it.... Would you please.... We're trying to shoot a scene. -Okay. -Thank you. Okay, again. We're close. Turn southwest. There's no land southwest for thousands of miles. It takes us way outside the shipping lanes. I won't sail blind in these waters. I'll make it worth your while. There's nothing out there. Well, then you've nothing to lose. If someone were to tell you this ship was headed for Singapore... what would you say? I would say they're full of it, Mr Hayes. Well, we turned southwest last night. Gentlemen, please. -We're not looking for trouble. -No. You're looking for something else. Yes, we are. We're going to find Skull lsland. Find it, film it, and show it to the world. For 25 cents, you get to see the last blank space on the map. I wouldn't be so sure of that. What do you mean? Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes were working our passage... on a Norwegian bark. We picked up a castaway. We found him in the water. He'd been drifting for days. His ship had run aground on an island way west of Sumatra. An island hidden in fog. He spoke of a huge wall... built so long ago... no one knew who'd made it. A wall 100 foot high... as strong today as it was ages ago. Why'd they build the wall? Well, the castaway, he spoke of a creature... neither beast nor man... but something monstrous, living behind that wall. A lion or a tiger. A man-eater. That's how all these stories start. What else did he say? Nothing. We found him the next morning. He'd stuck a knife through his heart. Sorry, fellows. You'll have to do better than that. Monsters belong in B movies. If you find this place... if you go ashore with your friends and your cameras... you won't come back. Just as long as you understand that. How long do you expect us to stay out here? You're writing a stage comedy? I'm writing it for you. Why would you do that? -Why would I write a play for you? -Yes. Isn't it obvious? Not to me. Well... it's in the subtext. I guess I must have missed it. It's not about words. Message for you, Captain. What's going on? Hayes, why are we changing course? -Englehorn, you can't just-- -Outside. There's a warrant out for your arrest. Did you know that? I've been ordered to divert to Rangoon. Another week. I haven't got a film yet. Please. I have risked everything I have on this. No, Denham. You risked everything I have. What do you want? Tell me what you want. I'll give you anything. I want you off my ship. Set a course for Rangoon, Mr Hayes. I'm finished. It's over for me, Jack. How'd you think this would end, Carl? Check our position. Use the stars. There are no stars, Captain. What is that? -What? -That. That right there. I don't know. What is it? A coffee stain? Station the forward lookout and get me the depth by lead line. Aye, Captain. 30 fathoms, no bottom! Reduce speed, steerage way only. Dead slow ahead, both. You should stop the ship. 15 degrees port. We're getting out of here, Mr Hayes. We'll find clear conditions. We have seabed! 25 fathoms! We're shallowing! 20 degrees starboard! Captain, you don't know where the hell you're going! Get me another reading! Another reading! 22 fathoms! -Douse the lights. -Aye, Captain. 10 fathoms! Wall! There's a wall ahead! Stop engines! Give me some power! Half astern both. Half astern both, Captain! Rocks! Rocks! Rocks to starboard, Captain! To port! Rocks everywhere! Take the wheel, Hayes. Hang on! Full ahead! Rocks to port, Captain! Turn, Captain! Starboard, starboard! Shore up that breach! Get me more men down here now! Come on, move, move! -Hayes! -She's taken a pounding! What about the prop? The shaft's not bent, as far as we can tell. But she struck hard against the rock! Captain! Better come up quick! Right there! Want me to bring them back? I don't give a damn about Carl Denham. I want this ship fixed and ready to float on the next high tide! Come on, move it. We're leaving, Mr Hayes. Can you believe this, Jack? We've got our picture. Why does Marlow keep going up the river? Why doesn't he turn back? There's a part of him that wants to, Jimmy. A part deep inside himself that sounds a warning. But there's another part... that needs to know. To defeat the thing which makes him afraid. ""We could not understand because we were too far... ""and could not remember... ""because we were travelling in the night of first ages... ""of those ages that are gone... ""leaving hardly a sign, and no memories. ""We are accustomed to look... ""upon the shackled form of a conquered monster... ""but there... ""there you could look at a thing monstrous and free. "" It's not an adventure story... is it, Mr Hayes? No, Jimmy. It's not. -It's deserted. -Of course it's deserted. Use your eyes, Preston. The place is a ruin. Nobody's lived here for hundreds of years. Mr Denham, I think we should go back. I will handle this. Look. Chocolate. You like chocolate? It's good to eat. You want? Take it. Here, put it in your hand and take it. For God's sakes, Denham, leave the native alone. She doesn't want the chocolate. All right! Just a bunch of women and old folks! They're harmless! Ann! Jack. Seen enough? Lighten the ship! Anything that's not bolted down goes overboard! Just heave it! We got away. We gotta be grateful for that, gentlemen. What about Mike? He didn't get away! He's still there! Mike died doing what he believed in! He didn't die for nothing. And I'll tell you something else. I'm gonna finish this film for Mike! I'll finish it... and I'll donate the proceeds... to his wife and kids. Because that man is a hero, and he deserves nothing less. Hear, hear! Chuck everything except for the potatoes! -What's wrong now? -Excuse me, Shakespeare. Come on, men! Come on, hurry! Drop those spare cables overboard! Go on, just chuck it! -Where's Ann? -What? Where's Ann? Ann! She's free! Full ahead, both engines! Ann! No! Stop! Turn back! Stop! We have to turn back. They've taken Ann. No! Kong! Kong! Kong! All hands going ashore! Report to stations! Jump to it! Jump to it, gentlemen! We're doing it, Mr Hayes! Come on, move it! Pull harder! Row! Row! Come on! Kong. Spread out! Find her! Miss Darrow! -Check up there, Jimmy! -Everybody stay together! Ann! She's here somewhere! What in God's name was that? Behind the wall! Behind the wall! She's gone! Carl, what is it? You saw something. You can take Hayes and 15 others. I'll put a guard on the gate until you return. The rest of you stay with the ship. Choy! Not you, Jimmy. Come on, Mr Hayes. Look at them. None of them knows which way to point a gun. Stay here. -Miss Darrow needs me! -No! Bring the tripod and all of the film stock. You wanna go with the 6-inch lens? The wide-angle will do just fine. You got guns. You got food. You got the ammo. And you got 24 hours! 24 hours? This time tomorrow, we haul anchor. Miss Darrow! Ann! Miss Darrow! Miss Darrow! What is it? Fire! Cut it out. Hold your fire. Hold your fire! Stay down, damn it. Stay down. Come on. Come on. Come on. Good shooting, Mr Hayes. Aren't these things supposed to be extinct? They are now. What the hell kind of a place is this? Miss Darrow! Ann! No! Ann! Miss Darrow! Ann! Ann! Christ, it's a bleeding boneyard! They've been ripped limb from limb. Ann! Ann! Just keep walking, Mr Hayes. Pretend you didn't see me. -Jesus, Jimmy. -Hey, I need that! I'm not giving you a gun! You were younger than me when they gave you one! I was in the Army. I was trained. I had a drill sergeant. I wanna help bring her back. Don't make me regret it. Conserve your ammunition! I'm knackered. I gotta have a breather. Great idea. Fellows, we don't have time for this. We've lost too much ground already. Come on, get up! They're not about to quit on you. Cut them some slack. All right, you got five minutes! Everybody stay in sight. Over here. I'm gonna get a wide shot of the valley. Bloody Nora! Is that what took Miss Darrow? There's only one creature capable of leaving a footprint that size. The abominable snowman. -Yeah, a snowman. -We dead meat. It's got to be what, 20, 25 feet? Carl saw it. Let's ask him. Denham! Where'd he go? Walk forward, Bruce. -What? -You're the star of this picture. Get into character and head toward the animals. What the hell kind of a place is this? Are you sure about this, Denham? Don't we have a stand-in for this type of thing? I need you in the shot, or people will say they're fake. Nobody's gonna think these are fake. You're making them nervous. No sudden movements. I'm not moving. Mother of God. What's this? What is it? What is it? Where's Carl? Carl? He's up there, filming. Bugger this! Watch out. Run, Jack! -Holy Christ. -Go, Jimmy, run! Run, run, run! -Let go! -I'm not leaving the camera! Let go, you idiot! Carl, run! Look out! Look out! Coming through! No! Come on. Carl! Carl! Get up! Come on. Come on. Mr Denham! Mr Denham! Herb! Herb, come on! Take the tripod! Come on! I'm pulling you up! Hold on to your end! Go! No, I'm not going anywhere without you! -You gotta leave me! -Shut up and hold on! Jimmy, do a head count. I want to know how many are injured and how bad. Injured? Four of us are dead! It's not your fault. What happened to Herb is no one's fault. You're absolutely right, Preston. And I'll tell you something else. Herbert didn't die for nothing. He died for what he believed in, and I'm gonna honour that. He died believing there was still some mystery left in this world. And we could all have a piece of it... for the price of an admission ticket. God damn it, Preston, we're gonna finish this film for Herb. We'll finish it... and donate the proceeds to his wife and kids. Come on, guys. We need more rope. All right, we gotta get back to the ship. -Englehorn sails in nine hours. -So? We gotta find Miss Darrow. Hey, do you hear me? We're gonna be stranded here. Miss Darrow was a great gal, no question. And she was a wonderful person. It's a terrible loss and we're all gonna miss her. I always knew you were nothing like the tough guy you play on screen. I just never figured you for a coward. Hey, pal! Hey, wake up. Heroes don't look like me, not in the real world. In the real world, they got bad teeth, a bald spot, and a beer gut. I'm just an actor with a gun, who's lost his motivation. Be seeing you. Anyone else? -Well, see you. -Come on. No! I said no! That's all there is. There isn't any more. Get them off the boat. Get them off the boat. Keep paddling. What the hell was that? Come on. Get them out of there! Preston! Give me your hand. Jack! Jack! -Choy! -Help! Swim, you filthy bugger. Choy! Stay with him. Swim to shore as fast as you can! Hold on. Preston! Whatever happens, don't let go of the camera! Don't let go of the camera! Come on, get up out of that water. Get up! Come on, come on. Preston. Preston. It's working. Did you get that, did you? No! No. No. What is it? Mr Hayes? If anything happens, I want you to run. You understand? I'm not a coward. I ain't gonna run. It's not about being brave, Jimmy. Go back! Back across the log! -I ain't gonna run! -Get Jimmy out of here! -No! -Get back! Get back! Move back! -No! No! -Stay back. No! Look at me. -Let him go! -You got to run, Jimmy. Do as I say. Go with Jack. Run! -No! -Shoot him! Here! Over here! Hold on! Hold on! Lumpy! Help me! Bloody hell, Choy! No! Oh, my! Wait! Carl. Jimmy. Jimmy. You all right? No. Get off! Get it off! Get off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Kill it! Stop moving! Get it off my face! -Stay still. -I am standing still. -Hold on. -Be careful! Don't move! Stay away from the walls! Coming through! Get out of there now! Climb! Nobody get in my way. Come on, Jimmy. Let's go. Get up the rope. Let's go. Hurry up. Jimmy, let's go. -Come on. -Okay. Go. Just as you go down... for the third and final time... as your head disappears beneath the waves... and your lungs fill with water... do you know what happens in those last precious seconds before you drown? Come on, buddy. Get up the rope. Come on. Get out of here. Come on. Your whole life passes before your eyes. And if you've lived as a true American... you get to watch it all in colour. Oh, and you will. Now, why don't you climb up the rope, huh? Come on. Come on, Driscoll. Let's go. It's beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. There. -Thank God. -Don't thank God. Thank Mr Baxter. He insisted on a rescue mission. Me? I knew you'd be okay. That's the thing about cockroaches. No matter how many times you flush them down the toilet... they always crawl back up the bowl. Hey, buddy? I'm out of the bowl. I'm drying off my wings and trekking across the lid. Driscoll! Don't be a fool! Give it up. It's useless! She's dead. She's not dead. Jack's gonna bring her back... and the ape will be hard on his heels. We can still come out of this thing okay. More than okay. Think about it. You got a boat full of chloroform we could put to good use. You wanna trap the ape? I don't think so. Isn't that what you do? Live animal capture? I heard you were the best. Jack! Look after yourself! Keep the gate open, will you? Sure thing, buddy. Good luck! I'm sorry. Ann. Jack! Run! Jack, Jack! Jack. Ann, it's okay. Ann, let's go. Let's go. Come on! Let's go. Come on. Come on! Carl! Please! Somebody help us! They've gone. Carl. Christ. Carl! Drop the bridge. Do it now, for Christ's sake! Not yet. Wait. Wait. Wait! Come on! -Now! -Throw them! Throw! No! Hold him! Are you out of your mind? -Stop! -Hold the line! Keep him down! Heave! Please! No! Stop! Jack. -No. -Get her out of.... -They'll kill him! -There's nothing we can do. -No! -Get her out of his sight! -It's too late. -Throw it! Look out! Let go of me. We gotta go. Come on. -Come on. -Stop it. Leave me alone! Ann, please come on. -Kill it! -No. No! It's over, you goddamn lunatic! All of you, run! Come on. Come on! Look out! Move it! Move it! Come on, come on! -Stay there! -It's me he wants! -Please stop this! -Move! Hold onto her! -Ann, go. -Please, I can stop this! -No! -Ann, stay there! Get it out! Get the hell out of here! -Come on! -Jimmy, don't be crazy! Come on. Don't be crazy. Let me go! Cast off! Come on, Carl! -Row! - Wait. Row, God damn it! Go back. Jimmy, no! No! No! Don't! Leave him alone! Hide out in back! -Wait! -No! No! No! Please don't! The whole world will pay to see this. We're millionaires, boys! I'll share it with all of you! In a few months, his name will be up in lights on Broadway! Kong! The Eighth Wonder of the World! Mr Denham! What can I say? What can I say? Any comments, Mr Denham? The Mayor, thank you. Ready. What am l? Thank you very much. Get used to it. -Listen, it's great to see you. Ready? -I'm really appreciating that.... -Look at you! -I remember you. -You're a lucky guy, Denham. -Am I a lucky guy? Maybe you're the lucky guy. Carl! -Zelman! -I told them. I know you did and I appreciate it. Let's get a shot of this. Come on. -Big smile. -Yeah! That's great! Look at yourself. Look at what you've become. -No woman is worth this. -This woman is worth it. I don't care what it takes, I gotta win her back. Oh, really? She's not gonna buy this for a second. Shut up and hand me the grapefruit! You're writing a comedy? Yes, I am. I'm writing it for you. Why would you do that? Why would I write a play for you? Isn't it obvious? Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't help but overhear. So, he took me to this fancy French restaurant... and halfway through the hors d'oeuvres, he clutches my hand. And that's when he told you how he felt? -No. He never said it. -He never said it? He probably thought he didn't need to say it. Well, then how does she know that it's real? -He said it was not about the words. -Oh, please! If you feel it, you say it. It's really very simple. He said we'd talk about it later. Only there was no later. It never happened. That's how it ended. He just let you walk away? He didn't try to save it? I honestly believed things might actually work out... which was really very... foolish. Men. Oh, they'll give you the world... but they let the one thing that truly matters... slip through their fingers. Typical. They're so busy being brave, they forget to use their brains. Romance. Who needs it? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen... I'm here to tell you a very strange story. The story of our adventure... in which 17 of our party suffered horrible deaths... their lives lost... in pursuit of a savage beast... a monstrous aberration of nature. But even the meanest brute can be tamed. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, as you will see... the beast was no match... for the charms of a girl. A girl from New York... who melted his heart... bringing to mind that old Arabian proverb... ""And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty... ""and beauty stayed his hand. ""And from that day forward, he was as one dead."" And now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to show you... the greatest thing your eyes have ever beheld. He was a king in the world he knew, but he comes to you now a captive. Ladies and gentlemen... I give you Kong, The Eighth Wonder of the World! Don't be alarmed. It's perfectly safe. These chains are made of chrome steel! Observe, if you will... I am touching the beast. I am actually laying my hand on the 25-foot gorilla. Crank them up, fellas. And now, we have in the auditorium tonight... a surprise guest. The real-life hero of this story. The man who hunted down the mighty Kong! The man who risked all to win the freedom of a helpless female. A big hand for Mr Bruce Baxter! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. He was right. About there still being some mystery left in this world... and we can all have a piece of it... for the price of an admission ticket. That's the thing you come to learn about Carl. His unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves. Please remain calm, ladies and gentlemen... for we now come to the climax of this savage ritual. The sacrifice of a beautiful young girl. Behold her terror as she is offered up to the mighty Kong! A big hand, folks, for the bravest girl I've ever met! Miss Ann Darrow. Save me from the beast! Help me! Where is she? -Where's Ann? -I have no idea. I heard he offered her all kinds of money and she turned him down flat. Pack up all my cares and woe Here I go Singing low Bye bye Blackbird Where somebody waits for me Sugar's sweet So is he Bye bye Blackbird Here's your story, boys. ""Beauty and the man who saved her from the beast."" We have to get these people out of here. Everyone needs to leave, okay? Come on. Let him roar. It makes a swell picture. Head for the exits. Get your own seat, buddy. You're not having mine. Excuse me, fellows. Coming through. Coming through, fellows. Get me down! Help me, please! Somebody! Somebody help me! Go! Go! Get out! Go! Go! There they are. Come on, come with me. Go! Wait for me! Go back! This way! Help! No! Taxi! Follow that ape. Come on, pal, we gotta draw him off. It's all yours, buddy. Better get out of here, lady! Come on. Buddy! Come on. Come on. Look out. Jesus Christ. Fire! Stop! Listen up. This is New York City, and this is sacred ground. You hear me? It was built for humans, by humans. Not for stinking lice-infested apes. The thought of some mutant gorilla... crapping all over the streets of this fair city, fills me with disgust. So this is how it's gonna be. We find it. We kill it. We cut its ugly head off and we ram it up.... No. No. Beautiful. Yes. Yes, it is. Look at that. Hey! Hey! Nobody past this point. You can't go in there! Stop him! Hey! Get back. You're not allowed up there! -What's going on? -Go! No! No! Please! No! No! Ann. Ann. Move along. Just one shot! One shot! -Come, come! -Boys, how about a photo? Look at me. Come on, watch the camera. Come a little closer. That's it, folks. Show's over. Step back! Clear the area. That's it. Shove off, boys. Why'd he do that? Climb up there and get himself cornered. The ape must have known what was coming. He's just a dumb animal. Didn't know nothing. What does it matter? Airplanes got him. It wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast., When the boy was born... ...like all Spartans, he was inspected. If he'd been small or puny or sickly or misshapen... ...he would have been discarded. From the time he could stand, he was baptized in the fire of combat. Taught never to retreat, never to surrender. Taught that death on the battlefield in service to Sparta... ...was the greatest glory he could achieve in his life. At age 7, as is customary in Sparta... ...the boy was taken from his mother and plunged into a world of violence. Manufactured by 300 years of Spartan warrior society... ...to create the finest soldiers the world has ever known. The agoge, as it's called, forces the boy to fight. Starves them, forces them to steal... ...and if necessary, to kill. By rod and lash the boy was punished... ...taught to show no pain, no mercy. Constantly tested, tossed into the wild. Left to pit his wits and will against nature's fury. It was his initiation... ...his time in the wild... ...for he would return to his people a Spartan... ...or not at all. The wolf begins to circle the boy. Claws of black steel... ...fur as dark night. Eyes glowing red... ...jewels from the pit of hell itself. The giant wolf sniffing... ...savoring the scent of the meal to come. It's not fear that grips him... ...only a heightened sense of things. The cold air in his lungs. Windswept pines moving against the coming night. His hands are steady. His form... ...perfect. And so the boy, given up for dead... ...returns to his people, to sacred Sparta, a king! Our king, Leonidas! It's been more than 30 years since the wolf and the winter cold. And now, as then, a beast approaches. Patient and confident, savoring the meal to come. But this beast is made of men and horses... ...swords and spears. An army of slaves, vast beyond imagining, ready to devour tiny Greece. Ready to snuff out the world's one hope for reason and justice. A beast approaches... ...and it was King Leonidas himself who provoked it. That's it. Now, the more you sweat here, the less you'll bleed in battle. My father taught me... ...that fear is always a constant. But accepting it... ...makes you stronger. My queen. A Persian emissary awaits Leonidas. In the end... ...a Spartars true strength is the warrior next to him. So give respect and honor to him, and it will be returned to you. First... ...you fight with your head. - Then you fight with your heart. What is it? A Persian messenger awaits you. Do not forget today's lesson. - Respect and honor. - Respect and honor. Councilman Theron. You found yourself needed, for once. My king and queen, I was just entertaining your guests. I'm sure. Before you speak, Persian... ...know that in Sparta everyone, even a king's messenger... ...is held accountable for the words of his voice. Now, what message do you bring? Earth and water. You rode all the way from Persia for earth and water? Do not be coy or stupid, Persian. You can afford neither in Sparta. What makes this woman think she can speak among men? Because only Spartan women give birth to real men. Let us walk to cool our tongues. If you value your lives over your complete annihilation... ...listen carefully, Leonidas. Xerxes conquers and controls everything he rests his eyes upon. He leads an army so massive, it shakes the ground with its march. So vast, it drinks the rivers dry. All the God-King Xerxes requires is this: A simple offering of earth and water... ...a token of Sparta's submission to the will of Xerxes. Submission. Now, that's a bit of a problem. See, rumor has it... ...the Athenians have already turned you down. And if those philosophers and boy-lovers have found that kind of nerve, then... - We must be diplomatic. - And, of course, Spartans... ...have their reputation to consider. Choose your next words carefully, Leonidas. They may be your last as king. ""Earth and water."" Madman. You're a madman. Earth and water. You'll find plenty of both down there. No man, Persian or Greek, no man threatens a messenger. You bring the crowns and heads of conquered kings to my city steps. You insult my queen. You threaten my people with slavery and death. Oh, I've chosen my words carefully, Persian. Perhaps you should have done the same. This is blasphemy. This is madness! Madness? This is Sparta! Welcome, Leonidas. We have been expecting you. The ephors, priests to the old gods. Inbred swine. More creature than man. Creatures whom even Leonidas must bribe and beg. For no Spartan king has gone to war without the ephors' blessing. The Persians claim their forces number in the millions. I hope, for our sake, they exaggerate. But there's no question, we face the most massive army ever assembled. Before your plan is heard... ...what do you offer? We will use our superior fighting skills... ...and the terrain of Greece herself to destroy them. We will march north to the coast, where I will make sure... It is August, Leonidas. The full moon approaches. The sacred and ancient festival. Sparta wages no war at the time of the Carneia. Sparta will burn! Her men will die at arms... ...and her women and children will be slaves or worse. Now, we will block the Persian coastal assault... ...by rebuilding the great Phocian Wall. And from there, we will funnel them into the mountain pass we call the Hot Gates. Now, in that narrow corridor, their numbers will count for nothing. And wave after wave of Persian attack... ...will smash against Spartan shields. Xerxes' losses will be so great, his men so demoralized... ...he will have no choice but to abandon his campaign. We must consult the oracle. Trust the gods, Leonidas. I'd prefer you trusted your reason. Your blasphemies... ...have cost us quite enough already. Don't compound them. We will consult the oracle. Diseased old mystics. Worthless remnants of a time before Sparta's ascent from darkness. Remnants of a senseless tradition. Tradition even Leonidas cannot defy... ...for he must respect the word of the ephors. That is the law. And no Spartan, subject or citizen, man or woman... ...slave or king, is above the law. The ephors choose only the most beautiful Spartan girls... ...to live among them as oracles. Their beauty is their curse... ...for the old wretches have the needs of men... ...and souls as black as hell. ""Pray to the winds... ...Sparta will fall. All Greece will fall. Trust not in men... ...honor the gods. Honor the Carneia."" The king's climb down is harder. Pompous, inbred swine. Worthless, diseased, rotten... ...corrupt. Truly, you're in the god-king's favor now... ...O wise and holy men. Yes. And when Sparta burns, you shall bathe in gold. Fresh oracles shall be delivered to you... ...daily... ...from every corner of the empire. Your lips can finish what your fingers have started. Or has the oracle robbed you of your desire as well? It would take more than the words of a drunken adolescent girl... ...to rob me of my desire for you. Then why so distant? Because it seems... ...though a slave and captive of lecherous old men... ...the oracle's words could set fire to all that I love. So that is why my king loses sleep and is forced from the warmth of his bed? There's only one womars words that should affect the mood of my husband. Those are mine. Then what must a king do to save his world... ...when the very laws he is sworn to protect force him to do nothing? It is not a question of what a Spartan citizen should do... ...nor a husband, nor a king. Instead ask yourself, my dearest love... ...what should a free man do? - Is this all of them? - As you ordered. Three hundred. All with born sons to carry on their name. We are with you, sire. For Sparta. For freedom. To the death. He is your son. He is too young to have felt a womars warmth. I have others to replace him. Astinos is as brave and ready as any. No younger than we were the first time you stood next to me in battle. You are a good friend... ...but a better captain, there is none. My good king. My good king, the oracle has spoken. The ephors have spoken. There must be no march. It is the law, my lord. - The Spartan army must not go to war. - Nor shall it. I've issued no such orders. I'm here just taking a stroll, stretching my legs. These 300 men are my personal bodyguard. Our army will stay in Sparta. Where will you go? I hadrt really thought about it... ...but now that you ask... ...I suppose I'll head north. The Hot Gates? Move out! Move out! What shall we do? What can we do? What can you do? Sparta will need sons. Spartan! Yes, milady? Come back with your shield... ...or on it. Yes, milady. ""Goodbye, my love."" He doesn't say it. There's no room for softness... ...not in Sparta. No place for weakness. Only the hard and strong may call themselves Spartans. Only the hard. Only the strong. We march... ...for our lands, for our families, for our freedoms. We march. Daxos. - What a pleasant surprise. - This morning's full of surprises, Leonidas. - We've been tricked. - Can't be more than a hundred. - This is a surprise. - Silence. This isn't their army. We heard Sparta was on the warpath and we were eager to join forces. If it is blood you seek, you are welcome to join us. But you bring only this handful of soldiers against Xerxes? I see I was wrong to expect Sparta's commitment to at least match our own. Doesrt it? You, there. What is your profession? I'm a potter, sir. And you, Arcadian. What is your profession? - Sculptor, sir. - Sculptor. - And you? - Blacksmith. Spartans! What is your profession? You see, old friend? I brought more soldiers than you did. No sleep tonight... ...not for the king. All his 40 years have been a straight road... ...to this one gleaming moment in destiny... ...this one radiant clash of shield and spear... ...sword and bone, and flesh and blood. His only regret... ...is that he has so few to sacrifice. We're being followed. It has followed us since Sparta. My king! Look! What happened here? Where are all the people? Persians. I put their number at around 20. A scouting party. But these footprints... Behind us! Child! It's quiet now. They... They came with beasts from the blackness. With their claws and fangs... ...they grabbed them. Everyone... ...but me. The villagers. I found them. Have the gods no mercy? We are doomed. Quiet yourself. The child speaks of the Persian ghosts, known from the ancient times. They are the hunters of mers souls. They cannot be killed or defeated. Not this darkness. Not these lmmortals. Immortals? We'll put their name to the test. Into the Hot Gates we march. Into that narrow corridor we march... ...where Xerxes' numbers count for nothing. Spartans, citizen-soldiers, freed slaves. Brave Greeks, all. Brothers, fathers, sons... ...we march. For honor's sake, for duty's sake, for glory's sake, we march. Look! Persians. Into hell's mouth we march. Let's watch these motherless dogs... ...as they're embraced by the loving arms of Greece herself. Come. True. It does look like rain. Zeus stabs the sky with thunderbolts... ...and batters the Persian ships with hurricane wind. Glorious. Only one among us keeps his Spartan reserve. Only he. Only our king. My queen? My queen... ...the courtyard is a more fitting place for a married woman. I'm afraid gossip and protocol... ...are the least of my worries now, councilman. Is such secrecy needed? How am I to trust beyond the walls of my own home? Even here, Theron has eyes and ears which fuel Sparta with doubt and fear. You speak as if all Sparta conspires against you. I wish it were only against me. Many on our council would vote to give all we have... ...and follow Leonidas... ...but you must show them favor. And you can arrange for me to speak to the council? If it is reason they want, I will let them know. Know what, my queen? Freedom isn't free at all. That it comes with the highest of costs, the cost of blood. I will do my best to gather our council. And its chamber shall be filled with your voice. - I'm in your debt. - No. Leonidas is my king as well as yours. I saw those ships smash on the rocks. How can this be? We saw but a fraction of the monster that is Xerxes' army. There can be no victory here. Why do you smile? Arcadian... ...I have fought countless times... ...yet I've never met an adversary who could offer me... ...what we Spartans call ""a beautiful death."" I can only hope... ...with all the world's warriors gathered against us... ...there might be one down there who's up to the task. Move! Keep going, you dogs! Move! Forward, I say! Stop here! Who commands here? I am the emissary... ...to the ruler of all the world... ...the god of gods, king of kings... ...and by that authority... ...I demand that someone show me your commander. Listen. Do you think the paltry dozen you slew scares us? These hills swarm with our scouts. And do you think your pathetic wall will do anything... ...except fall like a heap of dry leaves in the face of...? Our ancestors built this wall... ...using ancient stones from the bosom of Greece herself. And with a little Spartan help... ...your Persian scouts supplied the mortar. You will pay for your barbarism! My arm! It's not yours anymore. Go now. Run along and tell your Xerxes he faces free men here... ...not slaves. Do it quickly... ...before we decide to make our wall just a little bit bigger. No. Not slaves. Your women will be slaves. Your sons, your daughters... ...your elders will be slaves! But not you, no. By noon this day you will be dead men. A thousand nations of the Persian Empire descend upon you. Our arrows will blot out the sun. Then we will fight in the shade. The wall is solid. It'll do the job of funneling the Persians into the Hot Gates. Have the men found any route through the hills to our back? None, sire. There is such a route, good king. Just pass that western ridge. It's an old goat path. The Persians could use it to outflank us. Not one step closer, monster! Wise king, I humbly request an audience. - I'll skewer you where you stand. - I gave no such order. Forgive the captain. He is a good soldier... ...but a bit short on manners. There is nothing to forgive, brave king. I know what I look like. You wear the crimson of a Spartan. I am Ephialtes, born of Sparta. My mother's love led my parents to flee Sparta... ...lest I be discarded. Your shield and armor? My father's, sir. I beg you, bold king, to permit me... ...to redeem my father's name by serving you in combat. My father trained me to feel no fear, to make spear and shield and sword... ...as much a part of me as my own beating heart. I will earn my father's armor, noble king... ...by serving you in the battle. A fine thrust. I will kill many Persians. Raise your shield. - Sire? - Raise your shield as high as you can. Your father should have taught you how our phalanx works. We fight... ...as a single, impenetrable unit. That is the source of our strength. Each Spartan protects the man to his left... ...from thigh to neck with his shield. A single weak spot and the phalanx shatters. From thigh to neck, Ephialtes. I am sorry, my friend. - But not all of us were made to be soldiers. - But l... - lf you want to help in a Spartan victory... - Yes. ...clear the battlefield of the dead, tend the wounded, bring them water... ...but as for the fight itself... ...I cannot use you. You... Mother! Father! You were wrong! You are wrong! Leonidas! You are wrong! Dispatch the Phocians to the goat path... ...and pray to the gods nobody tells the Persians about it. Earthquake. No, captain. Battle formations. This is where we hold them. This is where we fight! This is where they die! Earn these shields, boys! Remember this day, men... ...for it will be yours for all time. Spartans! Lay down your weapons! Persians! Come and get them! Hold! Give them nothing... ...but take from them everything! Steady! Push! Is that the best you can do? Push! Push! Now! Push! No prisoners! No mercy! They look thirsty. Well, let's give them something to drink. To the cliffs. Halt. Hell of a good start. Tuck tail! Persian cowards. - What the hell are you laughing at? - Well, you had to say it. - What? - ""Fight in the shade."" Recover. Today no Spartan dies. Easy, son. We do what we were trained to do... ...what we were bred to do... ...what we were born to do. No prisoners. No mercy. A good start. - I was afraid you might not come. - I'm sorry, my son is... Is doing what children do best. Please, don't apologize. Your son starts the agoge next year. That is always a difficult time for a Spartan mother. Yes, it will be hard. But also necessary. You will speak before the council in two days' time. My husband does not have two days. Think of the two days as a gift. It's no secret... ...Theron wants what you control. It's his voice you must silence. Make him your ally... ...and you will have your victory. Thank you. You are wise as you are kind. There's your mother. You should keep a better eye on him if he's to be king one day. Be unfortunate if anything were to happen to him. Or to his beautiful mother. No! Our Greek comrades are begging for a crack at the Persians, sire. Good. I've got something I think they can handle. Tell Daxos that I want him... ...and 20 of his best eager, sober and ready for the next charge. King Leonidas. - Stelios, catch your breath, boy. - Yes, milord. The Persians are approaching. A small contingent. Too small for an attack. - Captain, I leave you in charge. - But sire... Relax, old friend. If they assassinate me, all of Sparta goes to war. Pray they're that stupid. Pray... ...we're that lucky. Besides... ...there's no reason we can't be civil... ...is there? None, sire. Let me guess. You must be Xerxes. Come, Leonidas. Let us reason together. It would be a regrettable waste... ...it would be nothing short of madness were you, brave king... ...and your valiant troops to perish... ...all because of a simple misunderstanding. - There's much our cultures could share. - Havert you noticed? We've been sharing our culture with you all morning. Yours is a fascinating tribe. Even now you are defiant... ...in the face of annihilation and the presence of a god. It isn't wise to stand against me, Leonidas. Imagine what a horrible fate awaits my enemies... ...when I would gladly kill any of my own men for victory. And I would die for any one of mine. You Greeks take pride in your logic. I suggest you employ it. Consider the beautiful land you so vigorously defend. Picture it reduced to ash at my whim. Consider the fate of your women. Clearly you don't know our women. I might as well have marched them up here, judging by what I've seen. You have many slaves, Xerxes... ...but few warriors. It won't be long before they fear my spears... ...more than your whips. It's not the lash they fear... ...it is my divine power. But I am a generous god. I can make you rich beyond all measure. I will make you warlord of all Greece. You will carry my battle standard to the heart of Europa. Your Athenian rivals... ...will kneel at your feet... ...if you will but kneel at mine. You are generous... ...as you are divine... ...O king of kings. Such an offer only a madman would refuse. But the... The idea of kneeling, it's... You see, slaughtering all those men of yours has... Well, it's left a nasty cramp in my leg... ...so kneeling will be hard for me. There will be no glory in your sacrifice. I will erase even the memory of Sparta from the histories. Every piece of Greek parchment shall be burned. Every Greek historian and every scribe shall have their eyes put out... ...and their tongues cut from their mouths. Why, uttering the very name of Sparta or Leonidas will be punishable by death. The world will never know you existed at all. The world will know that free men stood against a tyrant. That few stood against many. And before this battle was over... ...that even a god-king can bleed. You fought well today... ...for a woman. As did you. Maybe if I'm injured, you'll be able to keep up with me. Perhaps I was so far ahead you couldn't see me. More likely offering your backside to the Thespians. Jealousy... ...does not become you, my friend. Move it, men! Pile those Persians high. For unless I miss my guess... ...we're in for one wild night. They have served the dark will of Persian kings for 500 years. Eyes as dark as night. Teeth filed to fangs. Soulless. The personal guard to King Xerxes himself. The Persian warrior elite. The deadliest fighting force in all of Asia: The Immortals. The god-king has betrayed a fatal flaw: Hubris. Easy to taunt, easy to trick. Before wounds and weariness have taken their toll... ...the mad king throws the best he has at us. Xerxes has taken the bait. Spartans, push! Immortals. We put their name to the test. Father! My king! Arcadians, now! Go! Show the Spartans what we can do. Go! They shout and curse... ...stabbing wildly, more brawlers than warriors. They make a wondrous mess of things. Brave amateurs, they do their part. Immortals. They fail our king's test. And a man who fancies himself a god... ...feels a very human chill crawl up his spine. To our king! And our honored dead. Whom will Xerxes dare to send next? Whom?! There's nothing that can stop us now! Even the king allows himself to hope for more than glory. Such mad hope, but there it is: ""Against Asia's endless hordes, against all odds, we can do it. We can hold the Hot Gates. We can win."" Dawn. Whips crack. Barbarians howl. Those behind cry, ""Forward!"" Those in front cry, ""Back!"" Our eyes bear witness to the grotesque spectacle... ...coughed forth from the darkest corner of Xerxes' empire. When muscle failed... ...they turned to their magic. One hundred nations descend upon us, the armies of all Asia. Funneled into this narrow corridor, their numbers count for nothing. They fall by the hundreds. We send the severed bodies and the fragile hearts back to Xerxes' feet. King Xerxes is displeased with his generals. He disciplines them. Xerxes dispatches his monsters from half the world away. They're clumsy beasts... ...and the piled Persian dead are slippery. - You still here? - Somebody's gotta watch your back. Not now, I'm a little busy. Regroup! Astinos! My son! Astinos! No! Day wears on. We lose few... ...but each felled is a friend, or dearest blood. And upon seeing the headless body of his own young son... ...the captain breaks rank. He goes wild, blood-drunk. The captairs cries of pain at the loss of his son... ...are more frightening to the enemy than the deepest battle drums. It takes three men to restrain him and bring him back to our own. The day is ours. No songs are sung. Your gods were cruel to shape you so, friend Ephialtes. The Spartans, too... ...were cruel to reject you. But I am kind. Everything you could ever desire... ...every happiness you can imagine... ...every pleasure your fellow Greeks and your false gods have denied you... ...I will grant you. For I am kind. Embrace me as your king and as your god. Yes. Lead my soldiers to the hidden path that enters behind the cursed Spartans... ...and your joys will be endless. Yes! I want it all. Wealth. Women. And one more thing... ...I want a uniform. Done. You will find... ...I am kind. Unlike the cruel Leonidas, who demanded that you stand... ...I require only... ...that you kneel. Beautiful night. Yes, but I did not ask you here for small talk, Theron. You can be sure of that. You never spared words with me. Can I offer you something? A drink, perhaps? Is it poison? I'm sorry to disappoint you, it's only water. I'm told it's been arranged for you to go before the council. Yes. I need your help in winning votes to send the army north to our king. Yes. I can see it, the two of us standing together. Me, politician. You, warrior. Our voices as one. But why would I want to do that? It proves you care for a king who right now fights for the very water we drink. True. But this is politics, not war. Leonidas is an idealist. I know your kind too well. You send men to slaughter for your own gain. Your husband, our king, has taken 300 of our finest to slaughter. He's broken our laws and left without the council's consent. - I'm simply a realist. - You're an opportunist. You're as foolish as Leonidas if you think men don't have a price in this world. All men are not created equal. That's the Spartan code, my little queen. I admire your passion. But don't think that you... ...a woman, even a queen... ...can walk into the council chamber and sway the minds of men. I own that chamber... ...as if it were built with these hands. I could crush the life out of you right now. You will go before the council, but your words will fall on deaf ears. Leonidas will receive no reinforcements, and if he returns, without my help... ...he will go to jail or worse. Do you love your Sparta? Yes. - And your king? - I do. Your husband fights for his land and his love. What do you have to offer... ...in return for my word that I'll help you send our army north? What does a realist want with his queen? I think you know. This will not be over quickly. You will not enjoy this. I'm not your king. Dilios. I trust that scratch hasn't made you useless? Hardly, my lord. It's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare. My captain? Curses the gods and mourns alone. Leonidas! We are undone. Undone, I tell you. Destroyed. Daxos, calm yourself. Our hunchback traitor led Xerxes' lmmortals to the hidden goat path behind us. The Phocians you posted there were scattered without a fight. - This battle is over, Leonidas. - This battle is over when I say it is over. By morning, the lmmortals will surround us. The Hot Gates will fall. Spartans! Prepare for glory! Glory? Have you gone mad? There is no glory to be had now. Only retreat or surrender. Or death. Well, that's an easy choice for us, Arcadian. Spartans never retreat. Spartans never surrender. Go spread the word. Let every Greek assembled know the truth of this. Let each among them search his own soul. And while you're at it, search your own. My men will leave with me. Godspeed, Leonidas. Children! Children. Gather round. No retreat, no surrender. That is Spartan law. And by Spartan law, we will stand and fight... ...and die. A new age has begun. An age of freedom. And all will know that 300 Spartans... ...gave their last breath to defend it. My friend. I have lived my entire life without regret until now. It's not that my son gave up his life for his country. It's just that I never told him that I loved him the most. That he stood by me with honor. That he was all that was best in me. My heart is broken for your loss. Heart? I have filled my heart... ...with hate. Good. Dilios... ...let's take a walk. Yes, my lord. But, sire, I am fit and ready for battle. That you are, one of the finest. But you have another talent unlike any other Spartan. You will deliver my final orders to the council... ...with force and verve. Tell them our story. Make every Greek know what happened here. You'll have a grand tale to tell. A tale of victory. Victory. Yes, my lord. Sire, any message...? For the queen? None that need be spoken. Hundreds leave. A handful stay. Only one looks back. Spartans! Ready your breakfast and eat hearty... ...for tonight we dine in hell! May I give the floor now... ...to the wife of Leonidas and queen of Sparta. - What's this? - This is nothing. Councilmen... ...I stand before you not only as your queen. I come to you as a mother. I come to you as a wife. I come to you as a Spartan woman. I come to you with great humility. I am not here to represent Leonidas. His actions speak louder than my words ever could. I am here for all those voices which cannot be heard. Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons. Three hundred families that bleed for our rights... ...and for the very principles this room was built upon. We are at war, gentlemen. We must send the entire Spartan army to aid our king... ...in the preservation of not just ourselves, but of our children. Send the army for the preservation of liberty. Send it for justice. Send it for law and order. Send it for reason. But most importantly, send our army for hope. Hope that a king and his men have not been wasted to the pages of history. That their courage bonds us together. That we are made stronger by their actions... ...and that your choices today reflect their bravery. Three hundred. We must send them. Moving... ...eloquent, passionate. But it doesn't change the fact that your husband has brought war upon us. You are wrong. Xerxes brought it forth... ...and before that, his father Darius at Marathon. The Persians will not stop... ...until the only shelter we will find is rubble and chaos. This chamber needs no history lesson, my queen. Then what is the lesson you would like to leave? Shall I begin to enumerate all of them? Honor. Duty. Glory. You speak of honor, duty and glory? But what of adultery? - How dare you. - How dare I? Watch her carefully. She is a trickster in true form. Do not play with the members of this sacred chamber, my queen. Just hours ago, you offered yourself to me. Were I a weaker man, I would have her scent on me still. - This is outrage. - Oh, the hypocrite speaks! Did you not receive a similar payment, which you took... ...in exchange for her having an audience with these noble men? - That is a lie. - Is it? Was he not, by your invitation, asked to come to the king's bedchamber? The very bed where you attempted to negotiate with me so vigorously? You look shocked. A bribe of the flesh, gentlemen... ...while her husband promotes anarchy and war. He speaks truth. Words escape even the most cunning tongue... ...my little whore queen. What queen-like behavior. Remove her from this chamber before she infects us further... ...with her inglorious and shabby self. This will not be over quickly. You will not enjoy this. I am not your queen. Traitor. Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Leonidas, my compliments and congratulations. You surely have turned calamity into victory. Despite your insufferable arrogance... ...the god-king has come to admire Spartan valor and fighting skill. You will make a mighty ally. Yield, Leonidas. Use your reason. Think of your men. I beg you. Listen to your fellow Greek. He can attest to the divine one's generosity. Despite your several insults, despite your horrid blasphemies... ...the lord of hosts is prepared to forgive all... ...and more, to reward your service. You fight for your lands. Keep them. You fight for Sparta. She will be wealthier and more powerful than ever before. You fight for your kingship. You will be proclaimed warlord of all Greece... ...answerable only to the one true master of the world. Leonidas, your victory will be complete... ...if you but lay down your arms... ...and kneel to holy Xerxes. It's been more than 30 years since the wolf in the winter cold. And now, as then, it's not fear that grips him... ...only restlessness. A heightened sense of things. The seaborne breeze coolly kissing the sweat at his chest and neck. Gulls cawing... ...complaining even as they feast on the thousands of floating dead. The steady breathing of the 300 at his back... ...ready to die for him without a moment's pause. Every one of them... ...ready to die. His helmet is stifling. His shield is heavy. Your spear. You there... ...Ephialtes. May you live forever. Leonidas, your spear. Stelios! Slaughter them! His helmet was stifling. It narrowed his vision, and he must see far. His shield was heavy. It threw him off balance... ...and his target is far away. The old ones say we Spartans are descended from Hercules himself. Bold Leonidas gives testament to our bloodline. His roar is long and loud. My king. It's an honor to die at your side. It's an honor to have lived at yours. My queen! My wife. My love. ""Remember us."" As simple an order as a king can give. ""Remember why we died."" For he did not wish tribute or song... ...nor monuments, nor poems of war and valor. His wish was simple. ""Remember us""... ...he said to me. That was his hope. Should any free soul come across that place... ...in all the countless centuries yet to be... ...may all our voices... ...whisper to you from the ageless stones. Go tell the Spartans, passerby... ...that here, by Spartan law, we lie. And so my king died... ...and my brothers died... ...barely a year ago. Long I pondered my king's cryptic talk of victory. Time has proven him wise. For from free Greek to free Greek... ...the word was spread that bold Leonidas and his 300... ...so far from home... ...laid down their lives not just for Sparta... ...but for all Greece and the promise this country holds. Now, here on this rugged patch of earth called Plataea... ...Xerxes' hordes face obliteration! Just there the barbarians huddle... ...sheer terror gripping tight their hearts... ...with icy fingers... ...knowing full well what merciless horrors they suffered... ...at the swords and spears of 300. Yet they stare now across the plain at 10,000 Spartans... ...commanding 30,000 free Greeks! The enemy outnumber us a paltry three to one. Good odds for any Greek. This day, we rescue a world from mysticism and tyranny... ...and usher in a future brighter than anything we can imagine. Give thanks, men... ...to Leonidas and the brave 300. To victory! "
