      "dialogue": "Good evening. Welcome to this third and final debate among the three major candidates for president of the US. Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, President George Bush, the Republican nominee, and independent candidate Ross Perot. I am Jim Lehrer of the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour on PBS. I will be the moderator for this debate, which is being sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. It will be 90 minutes long. It is happening before an audience on the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing. The format was conceived by and agreed to by representatives of the Bush and Clinton campaigns, and it is somewhat different than those used in the earlier debates. I will ask questions for the first half under rules that permit follow-ups. A panel of 3 other journalists will ask questions in the 2nd half under rules that do not. As always, each candidate will have 2 minutes, up to 2 minutes, to make a closing statement. The order of those, as well as that for the formal questioning, were all determined by a drawing. Gentlemen, again welcome and again good evening. It seems, from what some of those voters said at your Richmond debate, and from polling and other data, that each of you, fairly or not, faces serious voter concerns about the underlying credibility and believability of what each of you says you would do as president in the next 4 years."

      "dialogue": "No. There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans whove been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down. The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up. Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated. But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way. Its also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you cant tax and divide an economy that isnt growing. I propose an American version of what works in other countries  I think we can do it better: invest and grow. I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts. Invest and grow. Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems. This will work. On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration. I dont believe trickle down economics will work. Unemployment is up. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago. I think we can do better if we have the courage to change."

The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden. And what I dont like is trickle down government. And therein, I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle down, trickle down, and hes still talking about spending more and taxing more. Government  he says invest government, grow government. Government doesnt create jobs. If they do, theyre make-work jobs. Its the private sector that creates jobs. And yes, weve got too many taxes on the American people and were spending too much. And thats why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending. It wont be painless. I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there. It wont be painless but weve got to get the job done. But not by raising taxes. Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say were going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet because his figures dont add up and hes going to sock it right to the middle class taxpayer and lower, if hes going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes. So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory. I do not want any more trickle down government. Its gotten too big. I want to do something about that."

      "dialogue": "The basic problem with it, it doesnt balance the budget. If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them. Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding. If you take a patient into the hospital thats bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding. And we are bleeding arterially. Theres only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base  see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact. We have spent their money. Weve got to pay it back. This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice. My plan balances the budget within 6 years. We didnt do it faster than that because we didnt want to disrupt the economy. We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover. But we faced it and we did it, and we believe its fair, shared sacrifice. The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people. Youve had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least youll understand it. I think thats fundamental in our country, that you know what youre getting into."

Youve heard what Mr. Perot has said. Hes said its got  to do the things that you want to do, you cant do it by just taking the money from the rich. Thats what the president says as well. How do you respond to that? They said the numbers dont add up."
    },
    {
      "actor": "Clinton",
      "dialogue": "I disagree with both of them. For one thing, let me just follow up here. I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise  put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy. His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today. And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldnt. And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief. He vetoed middle class tax relief this year. And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent. Now, its hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years. So my view is the middle class is the  theyve been suffering, Jim. Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can? Yes. Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, theyre upper income people? Yes. But look whats happened to the middle class. Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and theyre paying higher taxes. The tax burden on them has not gone down. It has gone up. I dont think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector. The answer is to invest and grow this economy. Thats what works in other countries and thats whatll work here."

And I said I make a mistake. If I make a mistake, I admit it. Thats quite different than some. But I think thats the American way. I think everyones paying too much, but I think this idea that you can go out and  then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill. Yes, I did. And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a president to stand up to a spending Congress. We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates  who remembers that? They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15. We dont want to go back to that. And so yes, everybodys taxed too much and I want to get the taxes down, but not by signing a tax bill thats gonna raise taxes on people."

But in almost every category theyre lagging. Ill give you an example. He talks about all the jobs hes created in one or 2 years. Over the last ten years since hes been governor, theyre 30% behind, 30%  theyre 30% of the national average. On pay for teachers, on all these categories, Arkansas is right near the very bottom. You havent heard me mention this before, but were getting close now and I think its about time I start putting things in perspective. And Im going to do that. Its not dirty campaigning because hes been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here. So weve got to do that. I gotta get it in perspective. Whats his mistake?

And we almost had it done. And that institution, the House of Representatives  everyone is yelling Clean House! One of the reasons is we almost had it done, and the speaker  a very, able, decent fellow, I might add  but he twisted the arms of some of the sponsors of that legislation and had them change their vote. Whats relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and Id like it for the American people. I want the line-item veto. I want a check-off, so if the Congress cant do it, let people check off their income tax, 10% of it, to compel the government to cut spending. And if they cant do it, if the Congress cant do it, let them then have to do it across the board. Thats what we call a sequester.

And now we hear a lot of talk, oh, well, we all want enterprise zones, and yet the House and the Senate cant send it down without loading it up with a lot of, you know, these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation. I dont think in racial harmony that Im a laggard on that. Ive been speaking out since day 1. Weve gotten the Americans for Disabilities Act, which I think is one of the foremost pieces of civil rights legislation. And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I dont believe in quotas, and I dont think the American people believe in quotas. And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment. And that is good.

He really didnt have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now. I think its important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on  jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy. Those things deserve to be dealt with from day one. I will deal with them from day 1. They will be my first priority, not my election year concern."

You dont have to go back to Herbert Hoover. Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%. The misery index  unemployment and inflation added together  it was invented by the Democrats  went right through the roof. Weve cut it in half. And all you hear about is how bad things are. You know, remember the question, are you better off? Well, is a homebuyer better off he can refinance the home, because interest rates are down? Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their familys savings? I think they are. Is the guy out of work better off? Of course hes not, but hes not gonna be better off if we grow the government, if we invest, as Governor Clinton says, invest in more government. Youve got to free up the private sector. Youve got to let small businesses have more incentives. For 3 months  quarters Ive been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business. Capital gains, investment tax allowance, credit for first- time homebuyers. And its blocked by the Congress. And then if a little of it comes my way, they load it up with Christmas trees and tax increases, and I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer."

Mr. Perot, on this issue that I have raised at the very beginning and weve been talking about, which is leadership, as president of the US, it concerns  my reading of it, at least, my concerns about you, as expressed by folks in the polls and other places, it goes like this. You had a problem with General Motors. You took your $750 million and you left. You had a problem in the spring and summer about some personal hits that you took as a potential candidate for president of the US and you walked out."

They just wouldnt do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price theyre paying by waiting until its obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems. Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way. Our government is that point now. The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while were still relatively strong. If you have a heart problem, you dont wait till a heart attack to address it. So the General Motors experience is relevant. At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares. I sold them my remaining shares. They went their way. I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company. But lets take my life in perspective. Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course. When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed. And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years. Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset. Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there. I could have rationalized it. We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home. And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where its eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort. Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 oclock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded. And I didnt wilt and I didnt quit. Now, what happened in July weve covered again and again and again. But I think in terms of the American peoples concern about my commitment, Im here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in. And talk about not quitting, Im spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money. I put my wallet on the table for you and your children. Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do. Ive lived the American dream; Id like for your children to be able to live it, too."

I dont think theres any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done. And were still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we dont have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country. Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here. They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work. We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; weve got to control the health care costs for those people  otherwise we cant keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets. We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base. So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices. But they didnt have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better. Thats one of the things I want to change. I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs. We did it in my state, and we can do it nationally."

That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work. As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him. I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you cant stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company. And I take it back, because I think  he said he made a mistake. And the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it. Ive never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake. But one mistake hes made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you cant have it both ways. Theres a pattern here of appealing to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowds or the extremes in the environmental movement. You cant do it as president: you cant have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next. So my argument is not with Ross Perot; it is more with Governor Clinton."

I never said  and I defy you to find where I said  I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon. I think that should be a goal. I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved. The Natl Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon by the year 2000. I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency. And let me say this. I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it. That doesnt mean we have to write it into the law. Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer. It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years. In my state, were leading the country in private sector job growth. But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency. We also ought to convert more vehicles to compressed natural gas. Thats another way to improve the environment."

You implement that NAFTA, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people a dollar an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and youre going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order. Weve got to proceed very carefully on that. See, theres a lot I dont understand. I do understand business. I do understand creating jobs. I do understand how to make things work. And I got a long history of doing that. Now, if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, its that agreement thats about to be put into practice. Its very simple. Everybody says itll create jobs. Yes, itll create bubble jobs. Now, you know, watch this  listen very carefully to this. One-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there. Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs. And I finally  I thought I didnt understand it  called all the experts, and they said, oh, itll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years. Lets think it through here. Lets be careful. Im for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we dont have good trade agreements across the world. I hope well have a chance to get into that tonight, because I can get right to the center of the bulls-eye and tell you why were losing whole industries in this country."

Then the other day he says hes for it, however then weve got to pass other legislation. When youre president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, Im for it but Im on the other side of it. And its true on this and its true on CAFE. Look, if Ross were right when we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldnt they have gone down there now? You have a differential in wages right now. I just have an honest philosophical difference. I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity. I think it is exports that have saved us when were in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.

Neither I nor anybody else, as far a I know, agreed to give him our proxy to say that whatever he did was fine for the workers of this country and for the interests of this country. I am the one whos in the middle on this. Mr. Perot says its a bad deal. Mr. Bush says its a hunky-dory deal. I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy. I have a realistic approach to trade. I want more trade, and I know there are some good things in that agreement. But it can sure be made better. Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagans leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that Ill have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.

This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry. One of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business. We wont be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through. If the president has any interest tonight, Ill detail it to you; I wont take 10 minutes tonight. All these things take a few minutes. But thats happening as we sit here today. We hammerlock the American companies  American Airlines, Delta  the last few great we have, because were trying to do this deal with these 2 European companies. And never forget, theyve got Airbus over there, and its a government-owned, privately owned, consortium across Europe. Theyre dying to get the commercial airline business.

And we ought to have to limit  we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests. I agree with that. Weve wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry. Were going to have a hard time rebuilding it. But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy. Look whats happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share  because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.

Going back 23 years, I dont know, Helen. I was opposed to the war. I couldnt help that. I felt very strongly about it, and I didnt want to go at the time. Its easy to say in retrospect I would have done something differently. President Lincoln opposed the war and there were people who said maybe he shouldnt be president, but I think he made us a pretty good president in wartime. Weve had a lot of other presidents who didnt wear their countrys uniform who had to order our young soldiers into battle, including President Wilson and President Roosevelt. So the answer is I could do that. I wouldnt relish doing it but I wouldnt shrink from it. I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened, when our treaty commitments are at stake, when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest, and that is a part of being president.

And I think its this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft. A lot of decent, honorable people felt as he did on the draft. But its this pattern. And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but youve got to, as president, you cant be on all these different sides, and you cant have this pattern of saying well, I did this or I didnt, then the facts come out and you change it.

One-third of the presidents budget is at the presidents discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime. Weve put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and thats good and thats helped. But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy. I see no evidence that it has done it. So what would I have done? What should I have done? I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help. So I made a mistake, and I  you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak. I knew wed have somebody out there yelling read my lips, and I did it because I thought it was right. And I made a mistake.

This was not a way to pay down the deficit. This was a trick on the American people. Thats not leadership. Lets go back in terms of accepting responsibility for your actions.

I think what he should have done is gone before the American people on the front end and said listen, I made a commitment and it was wrong. I made a mistake because I couldnt have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.

And in 12 years as governor I guess Ive taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change. It can be done. Thats why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for."

Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army. But then when he moved against Kuwait, I said this will not stand. And its hard to build a consensus. We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet. Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work  but I guess I would have voted with the majority. A president cant do that. Sometimes he has to act. And in this case Im glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the worlds oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon. We busted the 4th largest army, and we did it through leadership."

Weve got a very good record appointing women to high positions and positions of trust, and Im not defensive at all about it. What we got to do is keep working, as the Labor Dept is doing a first-class job on, to break down discrimination, to break down the glass ceiling.

It was interesting today. There was a story today or yesterday in the Washington Post about my economic programs and my chief budget officer and my chief economic officer were both African Americans, even though the Post didnt mention that, which I think is a sign of progress. The Natl Womens Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and Ive appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.

And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me Im another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation. And all of you in the press know exactly what Im talking about. They investigated every single one of my children. They investigated my wife. They interviewed all of my childrens friends from childhood on. They went to extraordinary sick lengths, and I just found it amusing that they would take 2 or 3 cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator  the lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common. And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I havent had that many lawsuits. So thats just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person thats running against them. This goes on night and day. I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past. One of the 2 groups has raised it to an art form. Its a sick art form. Now, lets go back to Saddam Hussein. We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions. Thats a fact. Weve never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them. Thats a fact. Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and thats a fact and its in all the newspapers. And you pull all of it at once and read it and I did, and its pretty clear what she and Kelly and the other key guys around that thing thought they were doing. Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October. So I say this is very simple. Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country. We later said no, thats not true. I said well, this is simple. What were her written instructions? We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally. Now, I say whose country is this? This is ours. Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table? The worst thing is, again, its a mistake. Nobody did any of this with evil intent. I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things. Whether its Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, its a steady stream."

And lets give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield. It was a remarkable event. But lets look at where I think the real mistake was made. In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran  the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend. All right, the wars over; we know hes dropping mustard gas on his own people, we know hes threatened to incinerate half of Israel. Several government departments  several  had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction. But in late 89 the president signed a secret policy saying we were going to continue to try to improve relations with him, and we sent him some sort of communication on the eve of his invasion of Kuwait that we still wanted better relations. So I think what was wrong  I give credit where credit is due  but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous."

All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that. And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said: This aggression will not stand. And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army. And the battlefield was searched, and there wasnt one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield. And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasnt been one single scintilla of evidence that theres any US technology involved in it. And what youre seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism. And I cannot let that stand, because it isnt true. Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isnt any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry  none, none whatsoever. And so I just have to say, its fine.

Now there are rumblings that a commercial bank crisis is on the horizon."

On the other hand, I dont think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis. The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives. Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster. The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks. I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people; secondly to say that we have to enforce the law in 2 ways. We dont want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that theyve created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years  but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble. We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not. And that will be my policy. And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact. It is a serious problem, but I dont see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was."

And when I am re-elected, I believe one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress not beholden to the old ways to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesnt put a lot of inhibitions on it, and protects the depositors through keeping the FDIC sound. But I think that  I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly theres no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view."

The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem. These crooks  now, Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks, because he robbed banks because thats where the money is; owning a savings and loan is where the money was. Now, in 1984 they were told. I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation. Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after election in 1988 because they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money, and it was in many cases stolen PAC money. Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it. And they buried it till right after the election. Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study thats been done  and Im reading it  right after election day this year theyre going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem. Now, if thats true, just tell me now. Im grownup, I can deal with it, Ill pay my share. But just tell me now; dont bury until after the election twice. I say that to both political parties.

You stay around this long enough, you think about  if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it. If youve been on television about it, you think you did it. What we need is people to stop talking and start doing. Now, our real problem here is they both have plans that will not work. The Wall Street Journal said your numbers dont add up. And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, were still drifting along with a huge deficit. So lets come back to harsh reality, and what I  you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, youre tough. Im saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and its not as tough as the revolution. And its fair, shared sacrifice to do the right thing for our country and for our children. And it will be fun if we all work together to do it."

    },
    {
      "actor": "Bush",
      "dialogue": "Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums. Why Ill win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it. Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest, have government invest. It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business. We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way. And so I believe the answer is, Im going to win it because Im getting into focus my agenda for Americas renewal, and also I think that Governor Clintons had pretty much of a free ride. On looking specifically at the Arkansas record  he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, Im the incumbent, fine. But hes an incumbent, and weve got to look at all the facts. Theyre almost at the bottom on every single category. We cant do that to the American people. And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think theres a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group. And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office. It doesnt work that way when youre president. Truman is right. The buck stops there. And you have to make decisions even when its against your own interest. And Ive done that. Its against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time. So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience. And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if theres a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that. And so Ill make the appeal on a wide array of issues. Also I got a philosophical difference. I got to watch the clock here. I dont think were a declining nation. The whole world has had economic problems. Were doing better than a lot of the countries in the world. And were going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home."

Im totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we dont. So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess. And I am also focussed on the fact that isnt it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and were losing whole industries overseas. Now, cant somebody agree with me that the government is breaking businesss legs with these trade agreements? Theyre breaking businesss legs in a number of different ways. We have an adversarial relationship thats destroying jobs and sending them overseas while we have the finest workers in the world. Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor. Its our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we dont break his legs in the process."

But the main thing is he still didnt get it, from what he said the other night to that fine woman on our program, the 209 people in Richmond. They dont want us talking about each other. They want us to talk about the problems of this country. I dont think hell be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and hes offering more of it, and what hes saying about my program is just not true. Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me. High tech executives in Northern California. Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm. Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Bradys wife, President Reagans press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldnt fight for the Brady Bill. Weve got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people."

I think the real winners of the debates were the American people. I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions. They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back. I want to say, since this is the last time Ill be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what hes done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention. Id like to say to Mr. Bush, even though Ive got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country. I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well. I just believe its time to change. I offer a new approach. Its not trickle down economics. Its been tried for 12 years and its failed. More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down. We can do better. And its not tax and spend economics. Its invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd to none and revitalize the private economy. That is my commitment to you. It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century. I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished. I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income. I know we can do better. It wont take miracles and it wont happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change. Thank you very much."

I dont believe in trickle-down government, I dont believe in larger taxes and larger government spending. And, lastly, the other night on character Governor Clinton said its not the character of the president but the character of the presidency. I couldnt disagree more. Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character. And I think it was Justice Black who talked about great nations, like great men, must keep their word. And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children? I need your support, I ask for your vote. And may God bless the US of America."

This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, well be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin the old car to get it back on the road. Now, the question is, can we win? Absolutely we can win, because its your country. Question really is who do you want in the White House. Its that simple. Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you youre throwing your vote away  you got to start using your own head. Then the question is, can we govern? I love that one. The we is you and me. You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you wont tolerate gridlock, you wont tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you wont tolerate non-performance. And, believe me, anybody that knows me understands I have a very low tolerance for non-performance also. Together we can get anything done. The president mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis. Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis. Pretty simply, whos the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs? Make your decision and vote on November the 3rd. I suggest you might consider somebody whos created jobs. Whos the best person to manage money? I suggest you pick a person whos successfully managed money. Whos the best person to get results and not talk? Look at the record and make your decision. Finally, to you students up there  God bless you, Im doing this for you: I want you to have the American dream. To the American people, Im doing this because I love you. Thats it.
