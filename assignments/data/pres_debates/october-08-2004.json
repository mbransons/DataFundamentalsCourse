{"content": [{"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Good evening from the Field House at Washington University in St. Louis. Im Charles Gibson of ABC News and Good Morning America. I welcome you to the second of the 2004 presidential debates between President George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, and Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee. The debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonights format is going to be a bit different. We have assembled a town-hall meeting. Were in the Show-Me State, as everyone knows Missouri to be, so Missouri residents will ask the questions. These 140 citizens were identified by the Gallup Organization as not yet committed in this election. Now, earlier today, each audience member gave me two questions on cards like this, one theyd like to ask the president, the other theyd like to ask the senator. I have selected the questions to be asked and the order. No one has seen the final list of questions but me, certainly not the candidates. No audience member knows if he or she will be called upon. Audience microphones will be turned off after a question is asked. Audience members will address their question to a specific candidate. Hell have two minutes to answer. The other candidate will have a minute and a half for rebuttal. And I have the option of extending discussion for one minute, to be divided equally between the two men. All subjects are open for discussion. And you probably know the light system by now. Green light at 30 seconds, yellow at 15, red at five, and flashing red means youre done. Those are the candidates rules. I will hold the candidates to the time limits forcefully but politely, I hope. And now, please join me in welcoming with great respect, President Bush and Senator Kerry. Gentlemen, to the business at hand. The first question is for Senator Kerry, and it will come from Cheryl Otis, who is right behind me."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(APPLAUSE)"}, {"actor": "Otis", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, after talking with several co-workers and family and friends, I asked the ones who said they were not voting for you, Why? They said that you were too wishy-washy."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Yes, I certainly do. But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating. I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening. Mr. President, its good to be with you again this evening, sir. Cheryl, the president didnt find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so hes really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception. And the result is that youve been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that Ive changed a position on this or that or the other. Now, the three things they try to say Ive changed position on are the Patriot Act; I havent. I support it. I just dont like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and were going to change a few things. The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things. No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it. I support it. I support the goals. But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion. Right here in St. Louis, youve laid off 350 teachers. Youre 150  excuse me, I think its a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here. So I complain about that. Ive argued that we should fully funded it. The president says Ive changed my mind. I havent changed my mind: Im going to fully fund it. So these are the differences. Now, the president has presided over an economy where weve lost 1.6 million jobs. The first president in 72 years to lose jobs. I have a plan to put people back to work. Thats not wishy- washy. Im going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas. The president wants to keep them open. I think Im right. I think hes wrong. Im going to give you a tax cut. The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together. I think thats wrong. Thats not wishy-washy, and thats what Im fighting for, you."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(LAUGHTER)"}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, a minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists. And, Senator, thank you. I can  and thanks, Washington U. as well. I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does. He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it. And that sends a confusing signal to people. He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power. No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does. You know, for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein. He saw the wisdom  until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions. I dont see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics. He just brought up the tax cut. You remember we increased that child credit by $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans. Thats right at the middle class. He voted against it. And yet he tells you hes for a middle- class tax cut. Its  youve got to be consistent when youre the president. Theres a lot of pressures. And youve got to be firm and consistent."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, I would follow up, but we have a series of questions on Iraq, and so I will turn to the next questioner. The question is for President Bush, and the questioner is Robin Dahle."}, {"actor": "Dahle", "dialogue": "Mr. President, yesterday in a statement you admitted that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction, but justified the invasion by stating, I quote, He retained the knowledge, the materials, the means and the intent to produce weapons of mass destruction and could have passed this knowledge to our terrorist enemies."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Each situation is different, Robin. And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force. The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force. After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently. After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us. In the old days wed see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not. But 9/11 changed it all. I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people. Thats why were bringing Al Qaida to justice. Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice. Thats why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, youre just as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan. And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction. And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction. And that was the serious, serious threat. So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations. But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions. He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs. We all thought there was weapons there, Robin. My opponent thought there was weapons there. Thats why he called him a grave threat. I wasnt happy when we found out there wasnt weapons, and weve got an intelligence group together to figure out why. But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat. And the world is better off without him in power. And my opponents plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous. Thank you, sir."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, a minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Robin, Im going to answer your question. Im also going to talk  respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time. The world is more dangerous today. The world is more dangerous today because the president didnt make the right judgments. Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind. He wants you to believe that because he cant come here and tell you that hes created new jobs for America. Hes lost jobs. He cant come here and tell you that hes created health care for Americans because, what, weve got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri. He cant come here and tell you that hes left no child behind because he didnt fund no child left behind. So what does he do? Hes trying to attack me. He wants you to believe that I cant be president. And hes trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind. Well, let me tell you straight up: Ive never changed my mind about Iraq. I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat. I always believed he was a threat. Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president. I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary. But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. I would have brought our allies to our side. I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission. This president rushed to war, pushed our allies aside. And Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons. He took his eye off the ball, off of Osama bin Laden."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, I do want to follow up on this one, because there were several questions from the audience along this line."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "(OFF-MIKE)"}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Go ahead. Go ahead."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Well, I was going to have you do the rebuttal on it, but you go ahead. Youre up."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(LAUGHTER)"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "You remember the last debate? My opponent said that America must pass a global test before we used force to protect ourselves. Thats the kind of mindset that says sanctions were working. Thats the kind of mindset that said, Lets keep it at the United Nations and hope things go well. Saddam Hussein was a threat because he could have given weapons of mass destruction to terrorist enemies. Sanctions were not working. The United Nations was not effective at removing Saddam Hussein."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator?"}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction. And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked. He didnt have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President. That was the objective. And if wed used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq. And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead. Thats the war against terror."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Were going to have another question now on the subject of Iraq. And Im going to turn to Anthony Baldi with a question for Senator Kerry."}, {"actor": "Baldi", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, the U.S. is preparing a new Iraq government and will proceed to withdraw U.S. troops."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Anthony, I would not. I have laid out a different plan, because the presidents plan is not working. You see that every night on television. Theres chaos in Iraq. King Abdullah of Jordan said just yesterday or the day before you cant hold elections in Iraq with the chaos thats going on today. Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent. Those are the Republican chairmans words. Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; its in the zone of dangerous. Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee. Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different. I would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasnt. He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U.N., pushed them away individually. Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO. They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq. Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq? No. Were they silent? Yes. Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that? No, because theyve always wanted this to be an American effort. You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, Dont bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you werent part of our original coalition. Now, thats not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer. Im going to get the training done for our troops. Im going to get the training of Iraqis done faster. And Im going to get our allies back to the table."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Two days ago in the Oval Office, I met with the finance minister from Iraq. He came to see me. And he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections. Think about it: Theyre going from tyranny to elections. He talked about the reconstruction efforts that are beginning to take hold. He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free. He said he was optimistic when he came here, then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric and all of a sudden he was pessimistic. Now, this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom. And we need to stand with him. My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because its called the Bush plan. Were going to train troops, and we are. Well have 125,000 trained by the end of December. Were spending about $7 billion. He talks about a grand idea: Lets have a summit; were going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit. And what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit? Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place. Risk your troops in a war youve called a mistake. Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesnt believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake. I know how these people think. I meet with them all the time. I talk to Tony Blair all the time. I talk to Silvio Berlusconi. Theyre not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake. Our plan is working. Were going to make elections. And Iraq is going to be free, and America will be better off for it."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Do you want to follow up, Senator?"}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Yes, sir, please. Ladies and gentlemen, the right war was Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan. That was the right place. And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains. Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction. That was the reason Congress gave him the authority to use force, not after excuse to get rid of the regime. Now we have to succeed. Ive always said that. I have been consistent. Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "First of all, we didnt find out he didnt have weapons until we got there, and my opponent thought he had weapons and told everybody he thought he had weapons. And secondly, its a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only Osama bin Laden. The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction. Thats what the war on terror is about. Of course, were going to find Osama bin Laden. Weve already 75 percent of his people. And were on the hunt for him. But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "The next question is for President Bush, and it comes from Nikki Washington."}, {"actor": "Washington", "dialogue": "Thank you. Mr. President, my mother and sister traveled abroad this summer, and when they got back they talked to us about how shocked they were at the intensity of aggravation that other countries had with how we handled the Iraq situation. Diplomacy is obviously something that we really have to really work on."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "No, I appreciate that. I  listen, I  weve got a great country. I love our values. And I recognize Ive made some decisions that have caused people to not understand the great values of our country. I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle. Somebody called that stubborn. He stood on principle standing up to the Soviet Union, and we won that conflict. Yet at the same time, he was very  we were very unpopular in Europe because of the decisions he made. I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular. But I made the decision because I thought it was in the right interests of our security. You know, Ive made some decisions on Israel thats unpopular. I wouldnt deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I dont think hes the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state. And people in Europe didnt like that decision. And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do. I believe Palestinians ought to have a state, but I know they need leadership thats committed to a democracy and freedom, leadership that would be willing to reject terrorism. I made a decision not to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which is where our troops could be brought to  brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge. I dont think we ought to join that. That was unpopular. And so, what Im telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think theyre right. Well continue to reach out. Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan. People love America. Sometimes they dont like the decisions made by America, but I dont think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing. You dont want to join the International Criminal Court just because its popular in certain capitals in Europe."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, a minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Nikki, thats a question thats been raised by a lot of people around the country. Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the presidents answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years. And his answer was, With a viable exit strategy and only with enough forces to get the job done. He didnt do that. He broke that promise. We didnt have enough forces. General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand. And guess what? They retired General Shinseki for telling him that. This president hasnt listened. I went to meet with the members of the Security Council in the week before we voted. I went to New York. I talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding Saddam Hussein accountable. I came away convinced that, if we worked at it, if we were ready to work and letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, theyd be there with us. But the president just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, Nope. Sorry, time for diplomacy is over. Were going. He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. Ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you hed plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us. He didnt. He broke his word."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President?"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, Do you have what you need in this war? Do you have what it takes? And they looked me in the eye and said, Yes, sir, Mr. President. Of course, I listen to our generals. Thats what a president does. A president sets the strategy and relies upon good military people to execute that strategy."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator?"}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "You rely on good military people to execute the military component of the strategy, but winning the peace is larger than just the military component. General Shinseki had the wisdom to say, Youre going to need several hundred thousand troops to win the peace. The militarys job is to win the war. A presidents job is to win the peace. The president did not do what was necessary. Didnt bring in enough nation. Didnt deliver the help. Didnt close off the borders. Didnt even guard the ammo dumps. And now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "The next question is for Senator Kerry, and it comes from over here, from Randee Jacobs. Youll need a microphone."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Is it Randee?"}, {"actor": "Jacobs", "dialogue": "Yes, Randee. Iran sponsors terrorism and has missiles capable of hitting Israel and southern Europe. Iran will have nuclear weapons in two to three years time."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "I dont think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee. But youre absolutely correct, it is a threat, its a huge threat. And whats interesting is, its a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasnt a threat. If hed let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldnt have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden. Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while theyre doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs. For two years, the president didnt even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor. We were safer before President Bush came to office. Now they have the bombs and were less safe. So what do we do? Weve got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, whove been involved, in their initiative. Weve got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole. But the presidents been slow to do that, even in Russia. At his pace, its going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. Ive proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years. And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon. Its very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when youre busy developing a new one. Im going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort. And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, a minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "That answer almost made me want to scowl. He keeps talking about, Let the inspectors do their job. Its naive and dangerous to say that. Thats what the Duelfer report showed. He was deceiving the inspectors. Secondly, of course weve been involved with Iran. I fully understand the threat. And thats why were doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions. Weve been doing that. Let me talk about North Korea. It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea. Remember, hes the person whos accusing me of not acting multilaterally. He now wants to take the six-party talks we have  China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States  and undermine them by having bilateral talks. He didnt honor the agreement. He was enriching uranium. That is a bad policy. Of course, were paying attention to these. Its a great question about Iran. Thats why in my speech to the Congress I said: Theres an Axis of Evil, Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and were paying attention to it. And were making progress."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Were going to move on, Mr. President, with a question for you. And it comes from Daniel Farley."}, {"actor": "Farley", "dialogue": "Mr. President, since we continue to police the world, how do you intend to maintain our military presence without reinstituting a draft?"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Yes, thats a great question. Thanks. I hear theres rumors on the Internets (sic) that were going to have a draft. Were not going to have a draft, period. The all- volunteer army works. It works particularly when we pay our troops well. It works when we make sure theyve got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets. An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world. We dont need mass armies anymore. One of the things weve done is weve taken the  were beginning to transform our military. And by that I mean were moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons. We dont need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent. In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with. And so were moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment. So to answer your question is, were withdrawing, not from the world, were withdrawing manpower so they can be stationed here in America, so theres less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to be  well be more likely to be able to keep people in the all-volunteer army. One of the more important things were doing in this administration is transformation. There are some really interesting technologies. For instance, were flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States. That saves manpower, and it saves equipment. It also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained. Now, forget all this talk about a draft. Were not going to have a draft so long as I am the president."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, a minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Daniel, I dont support a draft. But let me tell you where the presidents policies have put us. The president  and this is one of the reasons why I am very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the presidents father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovo, supporting me; because they all  and General Baca, who was the head of the National Guard, supporting me. Why? Because they understand that our military is overextended under the president. Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty. Youve got people doing two and three rotations. Youve got stop-loss policies, so people cant get out when they were supposed to. Youve got a back-door draft right now. And a lot of our military are underpaid. These are families that get hurt. It hurts the middle class. It hurts communities, because these are our first responders. And theyre called up. And theyre over there, not over here. Now, Im going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and Im going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because Im going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did, President Eisenhower did, and others. Were going to build alliances. Were not going to go unilaterally. Were not going to go alone like this president did."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, lets extend for a minute"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Let me just  Ive got to answer this."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Exactly. And with Reservists being held on duty"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Let me answer what he just said, about around the world."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Well, I want to get into the issue of the back-door draft"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "You tell Tony Blair were going alone. Tell Tony Blair were going alone. Tell Silvio Berlusconi were going alone. Tell Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland were going alone. There are 30 countries there. It denigrates an alliance to say were going alone, to discount their sacrifices. You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, youre going alone. And people listen. Theyre sacrificing with us."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator?"}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Mr. President, countries are leaving the coalition, not joining. Eight countries have left it. If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States. Thats not a grand coalition. Ninety percent of the casualties are American. Ninety percent of the costs are coming out of your pockets. I could do a better job. My plan does a better job. And thats why Ill be a better commander in chief."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "The next question, Senator Kerry, is for you, and it comes from Ann Bronsing, who I believe is over in this area."}, {"actor": "Bronsing", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, we have been fortunate that there have been no further terrorist attacks on American soil since 9/11. Why do you think this is?"}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Thank you very much, Ann. Ive asked in my security briefings why that is, and I cant go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you. This president and his administration have told you and all of us its not a question of when, its a question of  excuse me  not a question of if, its a question of when. Weve been told that. The when I cant tell you. Between the World Trade Center bombing in, what was it, 1993 or so, and the next time was five years, seven years. These people wait. Theyll plan. They plot. I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are. I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence. Youve got to have the best intelligence in the world. And in order to have the best intelligence in the world to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what theyre plotting, youve got to have the best cooperation youve ever had in the world. Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, were not getting the best cooperation in the world today. Weve got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now. Im going to change that. And Im going to put in place a better homeland security effort. This president in the last debate said, Well, that would be a big tax gap if we did that. Ladies and gentlemen, its his tax plan. He chose a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans over getting that equipment out into the homeland as fast as possible. We have bridges and tunnels that arent being secured, chemical plants, nuclear plants that arent secured, hospitals that are overcrowded with their emergency rooms. This president chose a tax cut over homeland security. Wrong choice."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President?"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Thats an odd thing to say, since weve tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion. Listen, well do everything we can to protect the homeland. My opponents right, we need good intelligence. Its also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion. The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense. We got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and they got to be right once. And thats the reality. And theres a lot of good people working hard. Were doing the best we possibly can to share information. Thats why the Patriot Act was important. The Patriot Act is vital, by the way. Its a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other. My opponent says he hadnt changed his position on it. No, but hes for weakening it. I dont think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really dont. First of all, I dont think he can succeed in Iraq. And if Iraq were to fail, itd be a haven for terrorists, and there would be money and the world would be much more dangerous. I dont see how you can win in Iraq if you dont believe we should be there in the first place. I dont see how you can lead troops if you say its the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time. I dont see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place. This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "I want to extend for a minute, Senator. And Im curious about something you said. You said, Its not when, but if. You think its inevitable because the sense of security is a very basic thing with everybody in this country worried about their kids."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Well, the president and his experts have told America that its not a question of if; its a question of when. And I accept what the president has said. These terrorists are serious, theyre deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill. I understand that. Thats why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists. But you heard the president just say to you that weve added money. Folks, the test is not if youve added money; the test is that youve done everything possible to make America secure. He chose a tax cut for wealthy Americans over the things that I listed to you."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President?"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Well, well talk about the tax cut for middle class here in a minute. But yes, Im worried. Im worried. Im worried about our country. And all I can tell you is every day I know that theres people working overtime, doing the very best they can. And the reason Im worried is because theres a vicious enemy that has an ideology of hate. And the way to defeat them long-term, by the way, is to spread freedom. Liberty can change habits. And thats whats happening in Afghanistan and Iraq."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, were going to turn to questions now on domestic policy. And were going to start with health issues. And the first question is for President Bush and its from John Horstman."}, {"actor": "Horstman", "dialogue": "Mr. President, why did you block the reimportation of safer and inexpensive drugs from Canada which would have cut 40 to 60 percent off of the cost?"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "I havent yet. Just want to make sure theyre safe. When a drug comes in from Canada, I want to make sure it cures you and doesnt kill you. And thats why the FDA and thats why the surgeon general are looking very carefully to make sure it can be done in a safe way. Ive got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you. And what my worry is is that, you know, it looks like its from Canada, and it might be from a third world. And weve just got to make sure, before somebody thinks theyre buying a product, that it works. And thats why were doing what were doing. Now, it may very well be here in December youll hear me say, I think theres a safe way to do it. There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper. One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker. Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand  brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs. And were doing just that. Another is to pass  to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards, and theyre working. Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs. These cards make sense. And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare. Because I went to Washington to fix problems. Medicare  the issue of Medicare used to be called Mediscare. People didnt want to touch it for fear of getting hurt politically. I wanted to get something done. I think our seniors deserve a modern medical system. And in 2006, our seniors will get prescription drug coverage. Thank you for asking."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator, a minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "John, you heard the president just say that he thought he might try to be for it. Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question: Cant people be able to import drugs from Canada? You know what he said? I think that makes sense. I think thats a good idea  four years ago. Now, the president said, Im not blocking that. Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didnt level with you right now again. He did block it, because we passed it in the United States Senate. We sent it over to the House, that you could import drugs. We took care of the safety issues. Were not talking about third-world drugs. Were talking about drugs made right here in the United States of America that have American brand names on them and American bottles. And were asking to be able to allow you to get them. The president blocked it. The president also took Medicare, which belongs to you. And he could have lowered the cost of Medicare and lowered your taxes and lowered the costs to seniors. You know what he did? He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A. does, which is bulk purchase drugs so that you can lower the price and get them out to you lower. He put $139 billion of windfall profit into the pockets of the drug companies right out of your pockets. Thats the difference between us. The president sides with the power companies, the oil companies, the drug companies. And Im fighting to let you get those drugs from Canada, and Im fighting to let Medicare survive. Im fighting for the middle class. That is the difference."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "If theyre safe, theyre coming. I want to remind you that it wasnt just my administration that made the decision on safety. President Clinton did the same thing, because we have an obligation to protect you. Now, he talks about Medicare. Hes been in the United States Senate 20 years. Show me one accomplishment toward Medicare that he accomplished. Ive been in Washington, D.C., three and a half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system. Thats what leadership is all about."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Actually, Mr. President, in 1997 we fixed Medicare, and I was one of the people involved in it. We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you dont know how to do: We balanced the budget. And we paid down the debt of our nation for two years in a row, and we created 23 million new jobs at the same time. And its the presidents fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history. Hes added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together. Go figure."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "The next question is for Senator Kerry. And this comes from Norma-Jean Laurent."}, {"actor": "Laurent", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, youve stated your concern for the rising cost of health care, yet you chose a vice presidential candidate who has made millions of dollars successfully suing medical professionals. How do you reconcile this with the voters?"}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Very easily. John Edwards is the author of the Patients Bill of Rights. He wanted to give people rights. John Edwards and I support tort reform. We both believe that, as lawyers  Im a lawyer, too. And I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has alluded everybody else because we know how to do it. Its in my health-care proposal. Go to johnkerry.com. You can pull it off of the Internet. And youll find a tort reform plan. Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends try to make a big deal out of it. Is it a problem? Yes, its a problem. Do we need to fix it, particularly for OGBYNs (sic) and for brain surgeons and others? Yes. But its less than 1 percent of the total cost of health care. Your premiums are going up. Youve gone up, in Missouri, about $3,500. Youve gone up 64 percent. Youve seen co-pays go up, deductibles go up. Everythings gone up. Five million people have lost their health insurance under this president. Hes done nothing about it. I have a plan. I have a plan to lower the cost of health care for you. I have a plan to cover all children. I have a plan to let you buy into the same health care senators and congressmen give themselves. I have a plan thats going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And I have a plan that will take the catastrophic cases out of the system, off your backs, pay for it out of a federal fund, which lowers the premiums for everybody in America, makes American business more competitive and makes health care more affordable. Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: Join me in rolling back the presidents unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year. Thats all. Ninety-eight percent of America, Im giving you a tax cut and Im giving you health care."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, a minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Let me see where to start here. First, the National Journal named Senator Kennedy the most liberal senator of all. And thats saying something in that bunch. You might say that took a lot of hard work. The reason I bring that up is because hes proposed $2.2 trillion in new spending, and he says he going to tax the rich to close the tax gap. He cant. Hes going to tax everybody here to fund his programs. Thats just reality. And what are his health programs? First, he says hes for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs. Theres a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if hes so much for it. Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause a 1 percent increase. That shows a lack of understanding. Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year. And finally, he said hes going to have a novel health care plan. You know what it is? The federal government is going to run it. Its the largest increase in federal government health care ever. And it fits with his philosophy. Thats why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal. Thats what liberals do. They create government-sponsored health care. Maybe you think that makes sense. I dont. Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing. It would ruin the quality of health care in America."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, we got several questions along this line, and Im just curious if youd go further on what you talked about with tort reform. Would you be favoring capping awards on pain and suffering? Would you limit attorneys fees?"}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "A follow-up"}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Yes. A follow-up on this for"}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Yes, I think we should look at the punitive and we should have some limitations. But look, whats really important, Charlie, is the president is just trying to scare everybody here with throwing labels around. I mean, compassionate conservative, what does that mean? Cutting 500,000 kids from after-school programs, cutting 365,000 kids from health care, running up the biggest deficits in American history. Mr. President, youre batting 0 for 2. I mean, seriously  labels dont mean anything. What means something is: Do you have a plan? And I want to talk about my plan some more  I hope we can."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Well get to that in just a minute. Thirty seconds, President Bush."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Youre right, what does matter is a plan. He said hes for  youre now for capping punitive damages? Thats odd. You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then. Medical liability issues are a problem, a significant problem. Hes been in the United States Senate for 20 years and he hasnt addressed it. We passed it out of the House of Representatives. Guess where its stuck? Its stuck in the Senate, because the trial lawyers wont act on it. And he put a trial lawyer on the ticket."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "The next question is for President Bush, and it comes from Matthew OBrien."}, {"actor": "Obrien", "dialogue": "Mr. President, you have enjoyed a Republican majority in the House and Senate for most of your presidency. In that time, youve not vetoed a single spending bill. Excluding $120 billion spent in Iran and  Im sorry, Iraq and Afghanistan, there has been $700 billion spent and not paid for by taxes. Please explain how the spending you have approved and not paid for is better for the American people than the spending proposed by your opponent."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Right, thank you for that. We have a deficit. We have a deficit because this country went into a recession. You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically six months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped. And that cost us revenue. That cost us revenue. Secondly, were at war. And Im going to spend what it takes to win the war, more than just $120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. Weve got to pay our troops more. We have. Weve increased money for ammunition and weapons and pay and homeland security. I just told this lady over here we spent  went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland. I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money. And plus, we cut taxes for everybody. Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession. I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression. I come from the school of thought that says when people have more money in their pocket during economic times, it increases demand or investment. Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added. We found out today that over the past 13 months, weve added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months. I proposed a plan, detailed budget, that shows us cutting the deficit in half by five years. And youre right, I havent vetoed any spending bills, because we work together. Non-homeland, non-defense discretionary spending was raising at 15 percent a year when I got into office. And today its less than 1 percent, because were working together to try to bring this deficit under control. Like you, Im concerned about the deficit. But I am not going to shortchange our troops in harms way. And Im not going to run up taxes, which will cost this economy jobs. Thank you for your question."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, a minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Let me begin by saying that my health-care plan is not what the president described. It is not a government takeover. You have choice. Choose your doctor, choose your plan. The government has nothing to do with it. In fact, it doesnt ask you to do anything  if you dont want to take it, you dont have to. If you like your high premiums, you keep them. Thats the way we leave it. Now with respect to the deficit, the president was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen. Thats where he was when he came into office. We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit. This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country. Hes the first president in 72 years to lose jobs. He talked about war. This is the first time the United States of America has ever had a tax cut when were at war. Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead. They knew how to ask the American people for the right things. One percent of America, the highest one percent of income earners in America, got $89 billion of tax cut last year. One percent of America got more than the 80 percent of America that earned from $100,000 down. The president thinks its more important to fight for that top 1 percent than to fight for fiscal responsibility and to fight for you. I want to put money in your pocket. I am  I have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000. The only people affected by my plan are the top income earners of America."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "I both  I heard you both say  I have heard you both say during the campaign, I just heard you say it, that youre going to cut the deficit by a half in four years. But I didnt hear one thing in the last three and a half minutes that would indicate how either one of you do that."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Well, look at the budget. One is make sure Congress doesnt overspend. But let me talk back about where weve been. The stock market was declining six months prior to my arrival. It was the largest stock market correction  one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession. Because we cut taxes on everybody  remember, we ran up the child credit by $1,000, we reduced the marriage penalty, we created a 10 percent bracket, everybody who pays taxes got relief  the recession was one of the shortest in our nations history."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, 30 seconds."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "After 9/11, after the recession had ended, the president asked for another tax cut and promised 5.6 million jobs would be created. He lost 1.6 million, ladies and gentlemen. And most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest people in the country. He came and asked for a tax cut  we wanted a tax cut to kick the economy into gear. Do you know what he presented us with? A $25 billion giveaway to the biggest corporations in America, including a $254 million refund check to Enron. Wrong priorities. You are my priority."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, the next question will be for you, and it comes from James Varner, who I believe is in this section. Mr. Varner? You need a microphone."}, {"actor": "Varner", "dialogue": "Thank you."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Absolutely. Yes. Right into the camera. Yes. I am not going to raise taxes. I have a tax cut. And heres my tax cut. I raise the child-care credit by $1,000 for families to help them be able to take care of their kids. I have a $4,000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents  and kids, if theyre earning for themselves  to be able to pay for college. And I lower the cost of health care in the way that I described to you. Every part of my program Ive shown how Im going to pay for it. And Ive gotten good people, like former Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin, for instance, who showed how to balance budgets and give you a good economy, to help me crunch these numbers and make them work. Ive even scaled back some of my favorite programs already, like the child-care program I wanted to fund and the national service program, because the presidents deficit keeps growing and Ive said as a pledge, Im going to cut the deficit in half in four years. Now, Im going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go. Were going to do it like you do it. The president broke the pay-as-you-go rule. I think John McCain called the energy bill the No Lobbyist Left Behind bill. I mean, youve got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks. Im pledging I will not raise taxes; Im giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200,000 a year. Now, for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, youre going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton, when people made a lot of money. And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, Im sorry, you too."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(LAUGHTER)"}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, 90 seconds."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Hes just not credible when he talks about being fiscally conservative. Hes just not credible. If you look at his record in the Senate, he voted to break the caps  the spending caps  over 200 times. And here he says hes going to be a fiscal conservative, all of a sudden. Its just not credible. You cannot believe it. And of course hes going to raise your taxes. You see, hes proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending. And you say: Well, how are you going to pay for it? He says, well, hes going to raise the taxes on the rich  thats what he said  the top two brackets. That raises, he says $800 billion; we say $600 billion. Weve got battling green eye shades. Somewhere in between those numbers  and so theres a difference, what hes promised and what he can raise. Now, either hes going to break all these wonderful promises hes told you about or hes going to raise taxes.

You looked at me like my clock was up. I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform. As I told you, weve just got a report that said over the past 13 months, weve created 1.9 million new jobs. Were growing. And so the fundamental question of this campaign is: Whos going to keep the economy growing so people can work? Thats the fundamental question."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Im going to come back one more time to how these numbers add up and how you can cut that deficit in half in four years, given what youve both said."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Well, first of all, the presidents figures of $2.2 trillion just arent accurate. Those are the fuzzy math figures put together by some group that works for the campaign. Thats not the number. Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, jointly, for a commission that closes corporate giveaway loopholes. Weve got $40 billion going to Bermuda. Weve got all kinds of giveaways. We ought to be shutting those down. And third, credible: Ladies and gentlemen, in 1985, I was one of the first Democrats to move to balance the budget. I voted for the balanced budget in 93 and 97. We did it. We did it. And I was there."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Thirty seconds. Im sorry, thirty seconds, Mr. President."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Yes, I mean, hes got a record. Its been there for 20 years. You can run, but you cant hide. He voted 98 times to raise taxes. I mean, these arent make-up figures. And so people are going to have to look at the record. Look at the record of the man running for the president. They dont name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasnt shown up to many meetings. They named him because of his votes. And its reality. Its just not credible to say hes going to keep taxes down and balance budgets."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, the next question is for you, and it comes from James Hubb over here."}, {"actor": "Hubb", "dialogue": "Mr. President, how would you rate yourself as an environmentalist? What specifically has your administration done to improve the condition of our nations air and water supply?"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Off-road diesel engines  we have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent. Ive got a plan to increase the wetlands by 3 million. Weve got an aggressive brown field program to refurbish inner-city sore spots to useful pieces of property. I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70 percent. I have  was fought for a very strong title in the farm bill for the conservation reserve program to set aside millions of acres of land to help improve wildlife and the habitat. We proposed and passed a healthy forest bill which was essential to working with  particularly in Western states  to make sure that our forests were protected. What happens in those forests, because of lousy federal policy, is they grow to be  they are not  theyre not harvested. Theyre not taken care of. And as a result, theyre like tinderboxes. And over the last summers Ive flown over there. And so, this is a reasonable policy to protect old stands of trees and at the same time make sure our forests arent vulnerable to the forest fires that have destroyed acres after acres in the West. Weve got a good, common-sense policy. Now, Im going to tell you what I really think is going to happen over time is technology is going to change the way we live for the good for the environment. Thats why I proposed a hydrogen automobile  hydrogen-generated automobile. Were spending $1 billion to come up with the technologies to do that. Thats why Im a big proponent of clean coal technology, to make sure we can use coal but in a clean way. I guess youd say Im a good steward of the land. The quality of the airs cleaner since Ive been the president. Fewer water complaints since Ive been the president. More land being restored since Ive been the president. Thank you for your question."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Boy, to listen to that  the president, I dont think, is living in a world of reality with respect to the environment. Now, if youre a Red Sox fan, thats OK. But if youre a president, its not. Let me just say to you, number one, dont throw the labels around. Labels dont mean anything. I supported welfare reform. I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America. Ive been for faith-based initiatives helping to intervene in the lives of young children for years. I was  broke with my party in 1985, one of the first three Democrats to fight for a balanced budget when it was heresy. Labels dont fit, ladies and gentlemen. Now, when it comes to the issue of the environment, this is one of the worst administrations in modern history. The Clear Skies bill that he just talked about, its one of those Orwellian names you pull out of the sky, slap it onto something, like No Child Left Behind but you leave millions of children behind. Here theyre leaving the skies and the environment behind. If they just left the Clean Air Act all alone the way it is today, no change, the air would be cleaner than it is if you pass the Clear Skies act. Were going backwards. In fact, his environmental enforcement chief air-quality person at the EPA resigned in protest over what theyre doing to what they are calling the new source performance standards for air quality. Theyre going backwards on the definition for wetlands. Theyre going backwards on the water quality. They pulled out of the global warming, declared it dead, didnt even accept the science.

And I just told you the facts, sir. The quality of the air is cleaner since Ive been the president of the United States.

And unfortunately again I regret this administration has not seized them and embraced them. Let me give you an example. There is a tax loophole right now. If youre a company in St. Louis working, trying to make jobs here, there is actually an incentive for you to go away. You get more money, you keep more of your taxes by going abroad. Im going to shut that loophole, and Im going to give the tax benefit to the companies that stay here in America to help make them more competitive. Secondly, were going to create a manufacturing jobs credit and a new jobs credit for people to be able to help hire and be more competitive here in America. Third, whats really hurting American business more than anything else is the cost of health care. Now, you didnt hear any plan from the president, because he doesnt have a plan to lower the cost of health care. Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush. I have a plan to cover those folks. And its a plan that lowers cost for everybody, covers all children. And the way I pay for it  Im not fiscally irresponsible  is I roll back the tax cut this president so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie. I think you ought to get the break. I want to lower your cost to health care. I want to fully fund education, No Child Left Behind, special-needs education. And thats how were going to be more competitive, by making sure our kids are graduating from school and college. China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are. Weve got to create the products of the future. Thats why I have a plan for energy independence within 10 years. And were going to put our laboratories and our colleges and our universities to work. And were going to get the great entrepreneurial spirit of this country, and were going to free ourselves from this dependency on Mideast oil. Thats how you create jobs and become competitive."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Let me start with how to control the cost of health care: medical liability reform, for starters, which hes opposed. Secondly, allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do. Thirdly, spread whats called health savings accounts. Its good for small businesses, good for owners. You own your own account. You can save tax-free. You get a catastrophic plan to help you on it. This is different from saying, OK, let me incent you to go on the government. Hes talking about his plan to keep jobs here. You know he calls it an outsourcing to keep  stop outsourcing. Robert Rubin looked at his plan and said it wont work. The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan. I proposed one to the Congress two years ago, encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal  to use coal and gas. It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel. Its stuck in the Senate. He and his running-mate didnt show up to vote when they could have got it going in the Senate. Less regulations if we want jobs here; legal reform if we want jobs here; and weve got to keep taxes low. Now, he says hes only going to tax the rich. Do you realize, 900,000 small businesses will be taxed under his plan because most small businesses are Subchapter S corps or limited partnerships, and they pay tax at the individual income tax level. And so when youre running up the taxes like that, youre taxing job creators, and thats not how you keep jobs here."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator, I want to extend for a minute, you talk about tax credits to stop outsourcing.

Ive never promised that. Im not going to, because that would be pandering. You cant. But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and thats what Im talking about.

The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan. And you know why he gets that count?

I really dont think your rights are being watered down. As a matter of fact, I wouldnt support it if I thought that. Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny. As a matter of fact, the tools now given to the terrorist fighters are the same tools that weve been using against drug dealers and white-collar criminals. So I really dont think so. I hope you dont think that. I mean, I  because I think whoever is the president must guard your liberties, must not erode your rights in America. The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldnt talk to each other. The intelligence-gathering and the law-enforcement arms of the FBI just couldnt share intelligence under the old law. And that didnt make any sense. Our law enforcement must have every tool necessary to find and disrupt terrorists at home and abroad before they hurt us again. Thats the task of the 21st century. And so, I dont think the Patriot Act abridges your rights at all. And I know its necessary. I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there. And they told me they could not have performed their duty, the duty we all expect of them, if they did not have the ability to communicate with each other under the Patriot Act."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, a minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Former Governor Racicot, as chairman of the Republican Party, said he thought that the Patriot Act has to be changed and fixed. Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, he is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said over his dead body before it gets renewed without being thoroughly rechecked. A whole bunch of folks in America are concerned about the way the Patriot Act has been applied. In fact, the inspector general of the Justice Department found that John Ashcroft had twice applied it in ways that were inappropriate. Peoples rights have been abused. I met a man who spent eight months in prison, wasnt even allowed to call his lawyer, wasnt allowed to get  finally, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois intervened and was able to get him out. This is in our country, folks, the United States of America. Theyve got sneak-and-peek searches that are allowed. Theyve got people allowed to go into churches now and political meetings without any showing of potential criminal activity or otherwise. Now, I voted for the Patriot Act. Ninety-nine United States senators voted for it. And the presidents been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say Im wishy-washy, that Im a flip-flopper. Now thats not a flip-flop. I believe in the Patriot Act. We need the things in it that coordinate the FBI and the CIA. We need to be stronger on terrorism. But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, the next question is for you, and it comes from Elizabeth Long."}, {"actor": "Long", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, thousands of people have already been cured or treated by the use of adult stem cells or umbilical cord stem cells. However, no one has been cured by using embryonic stem cells."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "You know, Elizabeth, I really respect your  the feeling thats in your question. I understand it. I know the morality thats prompting that question, and I respect it enormously. But like Nancy Reagan, and so many other people  you know, I was at a forum with Michael J. Fox the other day in New Hampshire, whos suffering from Parkinsons, and he wants us to do stem cell, embryonic stem cell. And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering. His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had. And he said to me and to the whole hall, he said, You know, dont take away my hope, because my hope is what keeps me going. Chris Reeve is a friend of mine. Chris Reeve exercises every single day to keep those muscles alive for the day when he believes he can walk again, and I want him to walk again. I think we can save lives. Now, I think we can do ethically guided embryonic stem-cell research. We have 100,000 to 200,000 embryos that are frozen in nitrogen today from fertility clinics. These werent taken from abortion or something like that. Theyre from a fertility clinic. And theyre either going to be destroyed or left frozen. And I believe if we have the option, which scientists tell us we do, of curing Parkinsons, curing diabetes, curing, you know, some kind of a, you know, paraplegic or quadriplegic or, you know, a spinal cord injury, anything, thats the nature of the human spirit. I think it is respecting life to reach for that cure. I think it is respecting life to do it in an ethical way. And the president has chosen a policy that makes it impossible for our scientists to do that. I want the future, and I think we have to grab it."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, a minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Embryonic stem-cell research requires the destruction of life to create a stem cell. Im the first president ever to allow funding  federal funding  for embryonic stem-cell research. I did to because I too hope that well discover cures from the stem cells and from the research derived. But I think weve got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science. And so I made the decision we wouldnt spend any more money beyond the 70 lines, 22 of which are now in action, because science is important, but so is ethics, so is balancing life. To destroy life to save life is  its one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face. There is going to be hundreds of experiments off the 22 lines that now exist that are active, and hopefully we find a cure. But as well, we need to continue to pursue adult stem-cell research. I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find cures. And the approach I took is one that I think is a balanced and necessary approach, to balance science and the concerns for life."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator, 30 seconds, less extent."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Well, you talk about walking a waffle line  he says hes allowed it, which means hes going to allow the destruction of life up to a certain amount and then he isnt going to allow it. I dont know how you draw that line. But let me tell you, point blank, the lines of stem cells that hes made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, Not adequate, because theyre contaminated by mouse cells, and because there arent 60 or 70  theyre are only about 11 to 20 now  and there arent enough to be able to do the research because theyre contaminated. Weve got to open up the possibilities of this research. And when I am president, Im going to do it because we have to."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President?"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Let me make sure you understand my decision. Those stem- cells lines already existed. The embryo had already been destroyed prior to my decision. I had to make the decision to destroy more life, so do we continue to destroy life  I made the decision to balance science and ethics."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, the next question is for you, and it comes from Jonathan Michaelson, over here."}, {"actor": "Michaelson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, if there were a vacancy in the Supreme Court and you had the opportunity to fill that position today, who would you choose and why?"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Im not telling. I really dont have  havent picked anybody yet. Plus, I want them all voting for me. I would pick somebody who would not allow their personal opinion to get in the way of the law. I would pick somebody who would strictly interpret the Constitution of the United States. Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldnt pick. I wouldnt pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldnt be said in a school because it had the words under God in it. I think thats an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision-making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution. Another example would be the Dred Scott case, which is where judges, years ago, said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights. Thats a personal opinion. Thats not what the Constitution says. The Constitution of the United States says were all  you know, it doesnt say that. It doesnt speak to the equality of America. And so, I would pick people that would be strict constructionists. Weve got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, D.C. Legislators make law; judges interpret the Constitution. And I suspect one of us will have a pick at the end of next year  the next four years. And thats the kind of judge Im going to put on there. No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution. Thank you."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(LAUGHTER)"}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, a minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Thank you, Charlie. A few years ago when he came to office, the president said  these are his words  What we need are some good conservative judges on the courts. And he said also that his two favorite justices are Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas. So you get a pretty good sense of where hes heading if he were to appoint somebody. Now, heres what I believe. I dont believe we need a good conservative judge, and I dont believe we need a good liberal judge. I dont believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side. I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard. He was a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. And he said the mark of a good judge, good justice, is that when youre reading their decision, their opinion, you cant tell if its written by a man or woman, a liberal or a conservative, a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian. You just know youre reading a good judicial decision. What I want to find, if I am privileged to have the opportunity to do it  and the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race, ladies and gentlemen. These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Going to go to the final two questions now, and the first one will be for Senator Kerry. And this comes from Sarah Degenhart."}, {"actor": "Degenhart", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, suppose you are speaking with a voter who believed abortion is murder and the voter asked for reassurance that his or her tax dollars would not go to support abortion, what would you say to that person?"}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now. First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins. Im a Catholic, raised a Catholic. I was an altar boy. Religion has been a huge part of my life. It helped lead me through a war, leads me today. But I cant take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesnt share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever. I cant do that. But I can counsel people. I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility. I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society. But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation. And I have to make that judgment. Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights. And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you dont deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they cant afford it otherwise. Thats why I think its important. Thats why I think its important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning. Youll help prevent AIDS. Youll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies. Youll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question. And I truly respect it."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Mr. President, minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Im trying to decipher that. My answer is, were not going to spend taxpayers money on abortion. This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America. I signed the partial-birth  the ban on partial-birth abortion. Its a brutal practice. Its one way to help reduce abortions. My opponent voted against the ban. I think there ought to be parental notification laws. Hes against them. I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. In other words, if youre a mom and youre pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one. My opponent was against that. These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America. I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life. I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion. And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done. Culture of life is really important for a country to have if its going to be a hospitable society. Thank you."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator, do you want to follow up? Thirty seconds."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that. You know, its just not that simple. No, Im not. Im against the partial-birth abortion, but youve got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother. Secondly, with respect to parental notification, Im not going to require a 16-or 17-year-old kid whos been raped by her father and whos pregnant to have to notify her father. So you got to have a judicial intervention. And because they didnt have a judicial intervention where she could go somewhere and get help, I voted against it. Its never quite as simple as the president wants you to believe."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "And 30 seconds, Mr. President."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Well, its pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion? Yes or no? And he was given a chance to vote, and he voted no. And thats just the way it is. Thats a vote. It came right up. Its clear for everybody to see. And as I said: You can run but you cant hide the reality."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "And the final question of the evening will be addressed to President Bush and it will come from Linda Grabel.

Linda Grabels over here."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Put a head fake on us."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(LAUGHTER)"}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "I got faked out myself."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Hi, Linda."}, {"actor": "Grabel", "dialogue": "President Bush, during the last four years, you have made thousands of decisions that have affected millions of lives. Please give three instances in which you came to realize you had made a wrong decision, and what you did to correct it.

And in a war, theres a lot of  theres a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldnt have done that. He shouldnt have made that decision. And Ill take responsibility for them. Im human. But on the big questions, about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, Ill stand by those decisions, because I think theyre right. Thats really what youre  when they ask about the mistakes, thats what theyre talking about. Theyre trying to say, Did you make a mistake going into Iraq? And the answer is, Absolutely not. It was the right decision. The Duelfer report confirmed that decision today, because what Saddam Hussein was doing was trying to get rid of sanctions so he could reconstitute a weapons program. And the biggest threat facing America is terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. We knew he hated us. We knew hed been  invaded other countries. We knew he tortured his own people. On the tax cut, its a big decision. I did the right decision. Our recession was one of the shallowest in modern history. Now, you asked what mistakes. I made some mistakes in appointing people, but Im not going to name them. I dont want to hurt their feelings on national TV."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(LAUGHTER)"}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "But history will look back, and Im fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration, because the president makes the decisions, the president has to take the responsibility."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator Kerry, a minute and a half."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "I believe the president made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was: build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job and go through the U.N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort. The president rushed our nation to war without a plan to win the peace. And simple things werent done. Thats why Senator Lugar says: incompetent in the delivery of services. Thats why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, you know: beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous. We didnt guard 850,000 tons of ammo. That ammo is now being used against our kids. Ten thousand out of 12,000 Humvees arent armored. I visited some of those kids with no limbs today, because they didnt have the armor on those vehicles. They didnt have the right body armor. Ive met parents whove on the Internet gotten the armor to send their kids. There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.

Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, maam. And he was a risk that  and this is where we just have a difference of opinion. The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, And the world would be a lot better off."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "And, Senator Kerry, 30 seconds."}, {"actor": "Kerry", "dialogue": "Not necessarily be in power, but heres what Ill say about the $87 billion.

Obviously the president and I both have very strong convictions. I respect him for that. But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer. I will never cede the authority of our country or our security to any other nation. Ill never give a veto over American security to any other entity  not a nation, not a country, not an institution. But I know, as I think you do, that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances. And thats the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it. We are not doing that today. We need to. I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists. And I will not stop in our efforts to hunt down and kill the terrorists. But Ill also have a better plan of how were going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts. In addition to that, I believe we have a crisis here at home, a crisis of the middle class that is increasingly squeezed, health-care costs going up. I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans. I have a plan to provide for our schools so we keep the standards but we help our teachers teach and elevate our schools by funding No Child Left Behind. I have a plan to protect the environment so that we leave this place in better shape to our children than we were handed it by our parents. Thats the test. I believe Americas best days are ahead of us. Im an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future. We can do this. And I ask you for the privilege of leading our nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world. Thank you."}, {"actor": "Gibson", "dialogue": "Senator. And a closing statement from President Bush."}, {"actor": "Bush", "dialogue": "Charlie, thanks. Thank you all very much. Its been enjoyable. The great contest for the presidency is about the future, who can lead, who can get things done. Weve been through a lot together as a country  been through a recession, corporate scandals, war. And yet think about where we are: Added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months. The farm income in America is high. Small businesses are flourishing. Homeownership rate is at an all-time high in America. Were on the move. Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, dont increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy. And abroad, were at war. And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined. I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until were safe. The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe. There is more work to be done. Well stay on the hunt on Al Qaida. Well deny sanctuary to these terrorists. Well make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction. Its the great nexus. The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction. But our long-term security depends on our deep faith in liberty. And well continue to promote freedom around the world. Freedom is on the march. Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president. In Iraq, well be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful.
