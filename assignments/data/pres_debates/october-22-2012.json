{"content": [{"actor": "Speakers", "dialogue": "FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., [*]SCHIEFFER: Good evening from the campus of Lynn University here in Boca Raton, Florida. This is the fourth and last debate of the 2012 campaign, brought to you by the Commission on Presidential Debates. This ones on foreign policy. Im Bob Schieffer of CBS News. The questions are mine, and I have not shared them with the candidates or their aides."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "The audience has taken a vow of silence  no applause, no reaction of any kind, except right now when we welcome President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney. Gentlemen, your campaigns have agreed to certain rules and they are simple. Theyve asked me to divide the evening into segments. Ill pose a question at the beginning of each segment. You will each have two minutes to respond and then we will have a general discussion until we move to the next segment. Tonights debate, as both of you know, comes on the 50th anniversary of the night that President Kennedy told the world that the Soviet Union had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba, perhaps the closest weve ever come to nuclear war. And it is a sobering reminder that every president faces at some point an unexpected threat to our national security from abroad. So lets begin."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(APPLAUSE)"}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "The first segment is the challenge of a changing Middle East and the new face of terrorism. Im going to put this into two segments so youll have two topic questions within this one segment on the subject. The first question, and it concerns Libya. The controversy over what happened there continues. Four Americans are dead, including an American ambassador. Questions remain. What happened? What caused it? Was it spontaneous? Was it an intelligence failure? Was it a policy failure? Was there an attempt to mislead people about what really happened? Governor Romney, you said this was an example of an American policy in the Middle East that is unraveling before our very eyes."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Id like to hear each of you give your thoughts on that. Governor Romney, you won the toss. You go first."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Thank you, Bob. And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening. Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here. And Mr. President, its good to be with you again. We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and its nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose. Well see what happens. This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a  a complete change in the  the structure and the  the environment in the Middle East. With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East. But instead, weve seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events. Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there. We see in  in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against  against our people there, four people dead. Our hearts and  and minds go out to them. Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals. We have in  in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood president. And so what were seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region. Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon. And  and were going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done. I congratulate him on  on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda. But we cant kill our way out of this mess. Were going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the  the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is  its certainly not on the run."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Its certainly not hiding. This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Mr. President?"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe. And thats what weve done over the last four years. We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11. And as a consequence, Al Qaedas core leadership has been decimated. In addition, were now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security. And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats. Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harms way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice. And thats exactly what were going to do. But I think its important to step back and think about what happened in Libya. Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years. Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend. We stand with them."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of. And, you know, Governor Romney, Im glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to  to kill them, to take them out of the picture. But my strategy is broader than that. Thats  thats important, of course. But the key that were going to have to pursue is a  is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own. We dont want another Iraq, we dont want another Afghanistan. Thats not the right course for us. The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the  the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these  these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world. One, more economic development. We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we  we push back and give them more economic development. Number two, better education. Number three, gender equality. Number four, the rule of law. We have to help these nations create civil societies. But whats been happening over the last couple of years is, as weve watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in. And  and theyre throughout many nations in the Middle East."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Its wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy. But next door, of course, we have Egypt. Libyas 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population. We want  we want to make sure that were seeing progress throughout the Middle East. With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to  to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult. And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, weve got real (inaudible)."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Well get to that, but lets give the president a chance."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Governor Romney, Im glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked whats the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, theyre now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold Wars been over for 20 years. But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s. You say that youre not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq. But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now. And the  the challenge we have  I know you havent been in a position to actually execute foreign policy  but every time youve offered an opinion, youve been wrong. You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction. You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day. You indicated that we shouldnt be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it. You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan. Then you said we should. Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "So, what  what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map. And unfortunately, thats the kind of opinions that youve offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Im going to add a couple of minutes here to give you a chance to respond."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Well, of course I dont concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that Ive said. They dont happen to be accurate. But  but I can say this, that were talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism were seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and  and confusion. And  and attacking me is not an agenda. Attacking me is not talking about how were going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Excuse me. Its a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same  in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face. Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again. I have clear eyes on this. Im not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin. And Im certainly not going to say to him, Ill give you more flexibility after the election. After the election, hell get more backbone. Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed I believe that there should be a status of forces agreement."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Oh you didnt? You didnt want a status of"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "What I would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down. And that certainly would not help us in the Middle East."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Im sorry, you actually  there was a  there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on. That was something I concurred with"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Governor"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "that your posture. That was my posture as well. You thought it should have been 5,000 troops"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Governor?"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": " I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what? The answer was we got"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": " no troops through whatsoever."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "This was just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "No, I"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Im sorry thats a"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "You  you"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "thats a  I indicated"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "major speech."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "I indicated that you failed to put in place a status"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Governor?"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Governor  here  heres  heres one thing"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "heres one thing Ive learned as commander in chief."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Let him answer"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Youve got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean. You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq. That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East. Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily. And so what Ive done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts. Number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israels security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region. Number three, we do have to make sure that were protecting religious minorities and women because these countries cant develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing. Number four, we do have to develop their economic  their economic capabilities. But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we cant continue to do nation building in these regions. Part of American leadership is making sure that were doing nation building here at home. That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Let me interject the second topic question in this segment about the Middle East and so on, and that is, you both mentioned  alluded to this, and that is Syria. The war in Syria has now spilled over into Lebanon. We have, what, more than 100 people that were killed there in a bomb. There were demonstrations there, eight people dead. Mr. President, its been more than a year since you saw  you told Assad he had to go. Since then, 30,000 Syrians have died. Weve had 300,000 refugees. And you go first, sir."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "What weve done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go. Weve mobilized sanctions against that government. We have made sure that they are isolated. We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and were particularly interested in making sure that were mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria. But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future. And so everything were doing, were doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this. This  what were seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and thats why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition. But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that were not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Well, lets step back and talk about whats happening in Syria and how important it is. First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster. Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Syria is Irans only ally in the Arab world. Its their route to the sea. Its the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel. And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us. Number two, seeing a  a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us. And finally, we dont want to have military involvement there. We dont want to get drawn into a military conflict. And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a  in a form of  if not government, a form of  of  of council that can take the lead in Syria. And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they dont have arms that get into the  the wrong hands. Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with  with Israel. But the Saudis and the Qatari, and  and the Turks are all very concerned about this. Theyre willing to work with us. We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the  the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties. Recognize  I believe that Assad must go. I believe he will go. But I believe  we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a  as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East. This  this is a critical opportunity for America. And what Im afraid of is weve watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well well let the U.N. deal with it. And Assad  excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said were going to try to have a ceasefire. That didnt work. Then it went to the Russians and said, lets see if you can do something. We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "All right."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "by the leadership role."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "We are playing the leadership role. We organized the Friends of Syria. We are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition. And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term. But going back to Libya  because this is an example of how we make choices. When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize. We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didnt stay there. And to the governors credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized. But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle. Imagine if we had pulled out at that point. You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden. And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job. Thats part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us. But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria. Thats exactly what were doing."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Governor, can I just ask you, would you go beyond what the administration would do, like for example, would you put in no-fly zones over Syria?"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "I dont want to have our military involved in Syria. I dont think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage. I dont anticipate that in the future. As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible. And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove  to remove Assad. But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our  of our troops."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Well"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "And this isnt  this isnt going to be necessary. We  we have, with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups. But look, this has been going on for a year. This is a time  this should have been a time for American leadership. We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties. As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the  the insurgents are highly disparate. They havent come together. They havent formed a unity group, a council of some kind. That needs to happen. America can help that happen. And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Can we get a quick response, Mr. President, because I want to"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Well, Ill  Ill be very quick. What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesnt have different ideas. And thats because were doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and a  an effective transition so that we get Assad out. Thats the kind of leadership weve shown. Thats the kind of leadership well continue to show."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "May I ask you, you know, during the Egyptian turmoil, there came a point when you said it was time for President Mubarak to go."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Right."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Some in your administration thought perhaps we should have waited a while on that. Do you have any regrets about that?"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "No, I dont, because I think that America has to stand with democracy. The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago. But what Ive also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities. And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure theyre doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region. These countries cant develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need. They have to abide by their treaty with Israel. That is a red line for us, because not only is Israels security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels. They have to make sure that theyre cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism. And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately whats going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities. Their aspirations are similar to young peoples here. They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school. They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future. And so one of the things that weve been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way thats noncorrupt, thats transparent. But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region theres some things that were going to have to do here at home as well."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Governor Romney, I want to hear your response to that, but I would just ask you, would you have stuck with Mubarak?"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "No. I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his  his action there. I felt that  I wish wed have had a better vision of the future. I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the presidents term and even further back than that, that wed have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didnt explode in the way that it did. But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support. Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more  is peaceful. We want a peaceful planet. We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know theyre going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war. Thats our purpose. And the mantle of leadership for the  promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America. We didnt ask for it. But its an honor that we have it. But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong. And that begins with a strong economy here at home. Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger. When the  when the president of Iraq  excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, thats a frightening thing. Former chief of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff said that  Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face. This  we have weakened our economy. We need a strong economy. We need to have as well a strong military. Our military is second to none in the world. Were blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence. But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that. We need to have strong allies. Our association and connection with our allies is essential to Americas strength. Were the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "And, finally, we have to stand by our principles. And if were strong in each of those things, American influence will grow. But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is Americas influence will grow. But unfortunately, in  nowhere in the world is Americas influence greater today than it was four years ago."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "All right."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "And thats because weve become weaker in each of those four"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "youre going to get a chance to respond to that, because thats a perfect segue into our next segment, and that is, what is Americas role in the world? And that is the question. What do each of you see as our role in the world, and I believe, Governor Romney, its your chance to go first."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Well I  I absolutely believe that America has a  a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that  that make the world more peaceful. And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections. Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace. They dont vote for war. So we want to promote those principles around the world. We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world. We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible. But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong. America must lead. And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home. You cant have 23 million people struggling to get a job. You cant have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate. You cant have kids coming out of college, half of them cant find a job today, or a job thats commensurate with their college degree. We have to get our economy going. And our military, weve got to strengthen our military long-term. We dont know what the world is going to throw at us down the road. We  we make decisions today in the military that  that will confront challenges we cant imagine. In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance. And a year later, 9/11 happened. So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military. I will not cut our military budget. We have to also stand by our allies. I  I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate. I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us. And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when  when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake. We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Mr. President?"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "America remains the one indispensable nation. And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office. Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan. It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade. And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat. But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and thats what my plan does. Making sure that were bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that were creating jobs here, as weve done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Making sure that weve got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. Doing everything we can to control our own energy. Weve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because weve developed oil and natural gas. But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020. Thats the kind of leadership that we need to show. And weve got to make sure that we reduce our deficit. Unfortunately, Governor Romneys plan doesnt do it. Weve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we dont need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more. That way we can invest in the research and technology thats always kept us at the cutting edge. Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign. Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies. Hes praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody whos  who shows great wisdom and judgment. And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Governor Romney, wrong and reckless policies?"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Ive got a policy for the future and agenda for the future. And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay. And what weve seen over the last four years is something I dont want to see over the next four years. The president said by now wed be a 5.4 percent unemployment. Were 9 million jobs short of that. I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and Ill do it with five simple steps. Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence. Were going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables. Number two, were going to increase our trade. Trade grows about 12 percent year. It doubles about every  every five or so years. We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America. The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully. As a matter of fact, Latin Americas economy is almost as big as the economy of China. Were all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us  time zone, language opportunities. Number three, were going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers unions going to have to go behind. And then were going to have to get to a balanced budget. We cant expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their companys money and invest in America if they think were headed to the road to Greece. And thats where were going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge. And Ill get us on track to a balanced budget. And finally, number five, weve got to champion small business. Small business is where jobs come from. Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration. I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Well, lets talk about what we need to compete. First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses. But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually dont help small businesses. And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top. And they include you and me. Thats not the kind of small business promotion we need. But lets take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and thats our education policy. We didnt have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate. You know, under my leadership, what weve done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states. Weve seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time. And theyre starting to finally make progress. And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that weve fallen behind when it comes to math and science. And those teachers can make a difference. Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isnt going to help the economy grow."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes dont make a difference. But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference. And if weve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, thats whats going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here. Companies are going to locate here depending on whether weve got the most highly skilled workforce. And the kinds of budget proposals that youve put forward, when we dont ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, thats undermining our long-term competitiveness. That is not good for Americas position in the world, and the world notices."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Let me get back to foreign policy."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Can I just get back"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Well  well, I need to speak a moment"}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "OK."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": " if youll let me, Bob, just about education"}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "OK."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": " because Im  Im so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of. We have every two years tests that look at how well our kids are doing. Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math. While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all 50 states in English, and then also in math. And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math. First time one state had been number one in all four measures. How did we do that? Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Ten years earlier"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "And that was  that was  that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "But that was 10 years before you took office."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "And then you cut education spending when you came into office."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "The first  the first  the first  and we kept our schools number one in the nation.

Id be happy to have you take a look. Come on our website. You look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to 10 years. We do it by getting  by reducing spending in a whole series of programs. By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare. There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just cant afford them. And that one doesnt sound good and its not affordable. So Id get rid of that one from day one. To the extent humanly possible, we get that out. We take program after program that we dont absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them. Number two, we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; well take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently. As a governor, I thought please, give me this program. I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it. States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these  these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively. I want to do those two things and get this  get this to a balanced budget with eight  eight to 10 years. But the military  lets get back to the military, though."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "He should have answered the first question."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Look, Governor Romneys called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says hes going to pay for by closing deductions. Now, the math doesnt work, but he continues to claim that hes going to do it. He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for. And thats the budget that weve put forward. But, what you cant do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts. You say that youre going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions, without naming what those loopholes and deductions are. And then somehow youre also going to deal with the deficit that weve already got. The math simply doesnt work. But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, weve got to think about capabilities. We need to be thinking about cyber security. We need to be talking about space. Thats exactly what our budget does, but its driven by strategy. Its not driven by politics. Its not driven by members of Congress, and what they would like to see. Its driven by, what are we going to need to keep the American people safe? Thats exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern. Because weve got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Im pleased that Ive balanced budgets. I was on the world of business for 25 years. If you didnt balance your budget, you went out of business. I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there. I had the chance to be governor of a state. Four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget. We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget. The president hasnt balanced a budget yet. I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "All right."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Im going to be able to balance the budget.

The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. Were now at under 285. Were headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration. Thats unacceptable to me. I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy. Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947. Weve changed for the first time since FDR  since FDR we had the  weve always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once. Now were changing to one conflict. Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people. And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts. That, in my view, is making  is making our future less certain and less secure."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Bob, I just need to comment on this. First of all, the sequester is not something that Ive proposed. It is something that Congress has proposed. It will not happen. The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending. It is maintaining it. But I think Governor Romney maybe hasnt spent enough time looking at how our military works. You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our militarys changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where were counting slips. Its what are our capabilities. And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that youre putting forward because it just doesnt work."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "All right."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "And, you know, we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesnt work."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "A lot to cover. Id like  Id like to move to the next segment: red lines, Israel and Iran. Would either of you  and youll have two minutes  and, President Obama, you have the first go at this one  would either of you be willing to declare that an attack on Israel is an attack on the United States, which, of course, is the same promise that we give to our close allies like Japan. And if you made such a declaration, would not that deter Iran? Its certainly deterred the Soviet Union for a long, long time when we made that  we made  we made that promise to our allies."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "First of all, Israel is a true friend. It is our greatest ally in the region. And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel. Ive made that clear throughout my presidency. And"}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "So youre  youre saying weve already made that declaration."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "I will stand with Israel if they are attacked. And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history. In fact, this week well be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week. But to the issue of Iran, as long as Im president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. I made that clear when I came into office."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy. Their currency has dropped 80 percent. Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago. So their economy is in a shambles. And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israels national security. We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world. Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism. And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, thats unacceptable. And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map. So the work that weve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice. They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said were not going to take any options off the table. The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, hes often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake, because when Ive sent young men and women into harms way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Two minutes."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if Im President of the United States, when Im President of the United States, we will stand with Israel. And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily. Thats number one. Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, theres no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America. It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means. And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference. I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one. And they do work. Youre seeing it right now in the economy. Its absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions. I would have put them in place earlier. But its good that we have them. Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions. I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, cant come into our ports. I imagine the E.U. would agree with us as well. Not only ships couldnt, but Id say companies that are moving their oil cant, people who are trading in their oil cant. I would tighten those sanctions further. Secondly, Id take on diplomatic isolation efforts. Id make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention. His words amount to genocide incitation. I would indict him for it. I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world. The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa. We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a  a  a solution to this, which says  which stops this  this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America. And of course, a military action is the last resort. It is something one would only  only consider if all of the other avenues had been  had been tried to their full extent."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Let me ask both of you, there  as you know, there are reports that Iran and the United States a part of an international group, have agreed in principle to talks about Irans nuclear program. What is the deal, if there are such talks? What is the deal that you would accept, Mr. President?"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper. They are not true. But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place. Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that. There  there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life. And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal well accept is they end their nuclear program. Its very straightforward. And Im glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that were taking. You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that youd do the same things we did, but youd say them louder and somehow that  that would make a difference. And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking. Its meticulous. We started from the day we got into office. And the reason is was so important  and this is a testament to how weve restored American credibility and strength around the world  is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China. Because if its just us that are imposing sanctions  weve had sanctions in place a long time. Its because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure. And weve got to maintain that pressure. There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established. They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program. There are inspections that are very intrusive. But over time, what they can do is regain credibility. In the meantime, though, were not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place. And one last thing  just  just to make this point. The clock is ticking. Were not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere. And Ive been very clear to them. You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program. And that clock is ticking. And were going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they dont have a nuclear weapon."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Governor?"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges weve had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be. I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength. And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the worlds worst actors in his first year, hed sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran. And I think they looked and thought, well, thats an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States. And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America. I think they looked at that and saw weakness. Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent. I think they noticed that as well. And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well. All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, were just going to keep on spinning centrifuges. Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world. Thats unacceptable for us, and its essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable. And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us. They must not develop nuclear capability. And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible. They need to be tightened. Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher. We need to indict Ahmadinejad. We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we wont have to take the military action."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Bob, let me just respond. Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing. This has been probably the biggest whopper thats been told during the course of this campaign. And every fact checker and every reporter whos looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true. And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, weve put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever. And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector. So Ill let the American people decide, judge, whos going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions. And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for. And  and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that weve been able to mobilize the world. When I came into office, the world was divided. Iran was resurgent. Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since  then in many years. And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon. Thats in Americas national interest and that will be the case so long as Im president."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Were four years closer to a nuclear Iran. Were four years closer to a nuclear Iran. And  and  we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they  they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer. Thats number one. Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq. And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations. And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel. And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive. You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations. Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations. We have freed other nations from dictators."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Bob, let me  let me respond. If were going to talk about trips that weve taken  when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops. And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didnt take donors. I didnt attend fundraisers. I went to Yad Beshef (ph), the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable. And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas. And I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their childrens bedrooms. And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids. Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "So thats how Ive used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region. And the  the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved? And they can look at my track record, whether its Iran sanctions, whether its dealing with counterterrorism, whether its supporting democracy, whether its supporting womens rights, whether its supporting religious minorities. And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history. And that kind of credibility is precisely why weve been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "What if  what if the prime minister of Israel called you on the phone and said, Our bombers are on the way. Were going to bomb Iran."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Bob, lets not go into hypotheticals of that nature. Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way.

Lets see what"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "But let me  let me come back  we can come back. Lets come back to what the president was speaking about, which is whats happening in the world and the presidents statement that things are going so well. Look, I look at whats happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb. I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult. I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether theyre rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but its clear theyre there. Theyre very strong. I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power. I see our trade deficit with China, larger than its  growing larger every year, as a matter of fact. I look around the world and I dont feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said theyre not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more. Theyre back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "I look around the world, I dont see our influence growing around the world. I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the  the  the turmoil with Israel."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "All right."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": " the damage in his  in his own party."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether its the Middle East, whether its Afghanistan, whether its Iraq, whether its now Iran, youve been all over the map. I mean, Im  Im pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program. But just a few years ago you said thats something youd never do. In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now youre for it, although it depends. In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there. The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi. When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call. But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldnt move heaven and earth to get one man."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission. And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him. You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9/11 happened. And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying Peyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you. And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation. And she said to me, You know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me. And when we do things like that  when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father. And I make that point because thats the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular. Those decisions generally  generally are not poll-tested. And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did. But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "All right, lets go. And that leads us  this takes us right to the next segment, Governor, Americas longest war, Afghanistan and Pakistan"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Bob"}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Governor, you get to go first."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "You cant  but you cant have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "With respect, sir, you had laid out quite a program"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Well, thats probably true."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Well give you  well catch up."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Well, were going to be finished by 2014, and when Im president, well make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014. The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so. Weve seen progress over the past several years. The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace. There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and were going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014. So our troops will come home at that point. I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at whats happening in Pakistan, and recognize that whats happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan. And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away. And I dont mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the  in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem. But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and theyre rushing to build a lot more. Theyll have more than Great Britain sometime in the  in the relatively near future. They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country. And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us. And so were going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us. And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Mr. President?"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade. We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops. That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq. And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place. Part of what had happened is wed forgotten why we had gone. We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths. And so we decimated Al Qaidas core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We then started to build up Afghan forces. And were now in a position where we can transition out, because theres no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country. Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion. Weve been there a long time, and weve got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need. But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war its time to do some nation building here at home. And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "You know, I was having lunch with some  a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances. When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch. And what weve said is lets change those certifications. The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work. And as a consequence, veterans unemployment is actually now lower than general population. It was higher when I came into office. So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because were making that transition in Afghanistan."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "All right. Let me go to Governor Romney because you talked about Pakistan and what needs to be done there. General Allen, our commander in Afghanistan, says that Americans continue to die at the hands of groups who are supported by Pakistan. We know that Pakistan has arrested the doctor who helped us catch Obama (sic) bin Laden. It still provides safe haven for terrorists, yet we continue to give Pakistan billions of dollars."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "No, its not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network. Its a nation thats not like  like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there. You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the  of three branches there. Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government. This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it  if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and youve got  youve got terrorists there who could grab their  their hands onto those nuclear weapons."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "This is  this is an important part of the world for us. Pakistan is  is technically an ally, and theyre not acting very much like an ally right now. But we have some work to do. And I  I dont blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained. We  we had to go into Pakistan. We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden. That was the right thing to do. And  and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that. But were going to have to work with the  with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that theyre on. And its important for them. Its important for the nuclear weapons. Its important for the success of Afghanistan. Because inside Pakistan, you have a  a large group of Pashtun that are  that are Taliban. Theyre going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go. And thats one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that. But its important for us to recognize that we cant just walk away from Pakistan. But we do need to make sure that as we  as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on  on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Let  let me ask you, Governor because we know President Obamas position on this, what is  what is your position on the use of drones?"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world. And its widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends. But let me also note that as I said earlier, were going to have to do more than just going after leaders and  and killing bad guys, important as that is."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Were also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism. We havent done that yet. We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the  the record, you look at the record. You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb? Yes. Is the Middle East in tumult? Yes. Is  is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels? No. Is  are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement? No, they havent had talks in two years. We have not seen the progress we need to have, and Im convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Well, keep in mind our strategy wasnt just going after bin Laden. We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan. And what weve also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in peoples lives day to day, to make sure that their governments arent corrupt, to make sure that theyre treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that theyve got a free market system that works. So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries. And we have stood on the side of democracy. One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation  me, my administration  stood with them earlier than just about any country. In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy. In Libya we stood on the side of the people. And as a consequence, theres no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed. But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States. And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "But were always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities. The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office. And they dont have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Lets  lets go to the next segment, because its a very important one. It is the rise of China and future challenges for America. I want to just begin this by asking both of you, and Mr. President, you  you go first this time."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks. We have to remain vigilant, as I just said. But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if its following the rules. So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else. I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade. And thats the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade. Thats the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other  the previous administration had done in two terms. And weve won just about every case that weve filed, that has been decided."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest  Pennsylvania  are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case. We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires  or  or cheap Chinese tires. And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America. I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldnt be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist. But I tell you, those workers dont feel that way. They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously. Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, weve also got to make sure, though, that were taking  taking care of business here at home. If we dont have the best education system in the world, if we dont continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, thats how we lose the competition. And, unfortunately, Governor Romneys budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "All right."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Well, first of all, its not government that makes business successful. Its not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people. Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran. Lets talk about China. China has an interest thats very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world. They dont want war. They dont want to see protectionism. They dont want to see the world break out into  into various forms of chaos, because they have to  they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000  20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs. So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open. And so we can be a partner with China. We dont have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form. We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if theyre willing to be responsible. Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America? How strong are we going to be? How strong is our economy? They look at the fact that we owe em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "They look at our  our decision to  to cut back on our military capabilities. A trillion dollars. The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. Its not my term, its the presidents own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. Its not my term, its the presidents own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating. They look at Americas commitments around the world and they see whats happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong? And the answer is, yes, if Im president, America will be very strong. Well also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us. Ive watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency. It holds down the prices of their goods. It means our goods arent as competitive and we lose jobs. Thats got to end. Theyre making some progress; they need to make more. Thats why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where theyre taking jobs. Theyre stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods. They have to understand we want to trade with them. We want a world thats stable. We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Well, Governor, let me just ask you. If you declare them a currency manipulator on day one, some people are  say youre just going to start a trade war with China on day one. Is that  isnt there a risk that that could happen?"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year. So its pretty clear who doesnt want a trade war. And theres one going on right now, which we dont know about it. Its a silent one. And theyre winning. We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and its worse this year than last year, and its worse last year than the year before. And so we have to understand that we cant just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out. We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively. We understand it. But this cant keep on going. You cant keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States. I was with one company that makes valves and  and process industries and they said, look, we were  we were having some valves coming in that  that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and  and they had our serial number on them. And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number. They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor. This cant go on. I want a great relationship with China. China can be our partner, but  but that doesnt mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Well, Governor Romneys right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas. And, you know, thats  youre right. I mean thats how our free market works. But Ive made a different bet on American workers. If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, wed be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China. If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas dont pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes. Now thats estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they wont be here, theyll be in places like China. And if were not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology. Now with respect to what weve done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993. We absolutely have to make more progress and thats why were going to keep on pressing. And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future. And we believe China can be a partner, but were also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there. We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues. And were organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards. Thats the kind of leadership weve shown in the region. Thats the kind of leadership that well continue to show."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "I just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for  for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country. But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere. Nothing could be further from the truth. Im a son of Detroit. I was born in Detroit. My dad was head of a car company. I like American cars. And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry. My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks. It was President Bush that wrote the first checks. I disagree with that. I said they need  these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy. And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that theyd  theyd built up."}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Governor Romney, thats not what you said"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Governor Romney, you did not"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "You can take a look at the op-ed"}, {"actor": "descriptor", "dialogue": "(CROSSTALK)"}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "You did not say that you would provide government help."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "I said that we would provide guarantees, and  and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy.

Cutting our education budget, thats not a smart choice. That will not help us compete with China. Cutting our investments in research and technology, thats not a smart choice. That will not help us compete with China. Bringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive. Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now. Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive. And the one thing that Im absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, weve now begun to make some real progress. What we cant do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place. Thats why we have to move forward and not go back."}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "I couldnt agree more about going forward, but I certainly dont want to go back to the policies of the last four years. The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle income families, now down $4,300 during your term. Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job. When you came to office 32 million people on food stamps. Today, 47 million people on food stamps. When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt. It hasnt worked. You said by now wed be at 5.4 percent unemployment. Were 9 million jobs short of that. Ive met some of those people. Ive met them in Appleton, Wisconsin. I met a young woman in  in Philadelphia whos coming out of  out of college, cant find work. Ive been  Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work. Its just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours, that the last four years have been so hard. And thats why its so critical, that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy. And thats not going to happen by just hiring teachers. Look, I love to  I love teachers, and Im happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that. By the way, I dont like to have the federal government start pushing its weight deeper and deeper into our schools. Let the states and localities do that. I was a governor. The federal government didnt hire our teachers."}, {"actor": "Unidentified Male", "dialogue": "Governor?"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "But I love teachers.

We have come to the end. It is time for closing statements, I believe youre first, Mr. President."}, {"actor": "Obama", "dialogue": "Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University. Youve now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials. And now youve got a choice. Over the last four years weve made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy thats wrong and reckless, economic policies that wont create jobs, wont reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top dont have to play by the same rules that you do. And Ive got a different vision for America. I want to build on our strengths. And Ive put forward a plan to make sure that were bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas. I want to make sure weve got the best education system in the world. And were retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future. Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we dont need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy. As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm. but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize weve got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom. And weve been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices. I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth. Thank you."}, {"actor": "Schieffer", "dialogue": "Governor?"}, {"actor": "Romney", "dialogue": "Thank you. Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you. Im optimistic about the future. Im excited about our prospects as a nation. I want to see peace. I want to see growing peace in this country. Its our objective. We have an opportunity to have real leadership. Americas going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure. I also want to make sure that we get this economy going. And there are two very different paths the country can take. One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean wed have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece. Ill get us on track to a balanced budget. The presidents path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The presidents path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The presidents path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job. Ill get people back to work with 12 million new jobs. Im going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs. Americas going to come back, and for that to happen, were going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle. I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle. Weve got to do that in Washington. Washington is broken. I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that. This nation is the hope of the earth. Weve been blessed by having a nation thats free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation. Theyve held a torch for the world to see  the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity. Now, its our turn to take that torch. Im convinced well do it. We need strong leadership. Id like to be that leader with your support. Ill work with you. Ill lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote. Id like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth.
