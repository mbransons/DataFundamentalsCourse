      "dialogue": "Good evening from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Im Gwen Ifill of The NewsHour and Washington Week on PBS. Welcome to the first and the only 2008 vice presidential debate between the Republican nominee, Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska, and the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden of Delaware. The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the two remaining presidential debates. Tonights discussion will cover a wide range of topics, including domestic and foreign policy matters. It will be divided roughly into five-minute segments. Each candidate will have 90 seconds to respond to a direct question and then an additional two minutes for rebuttal and follow-up. The order has been determined by a coin toss. The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me and have not been shared or cleared with anyone on the campaigns or on the commission. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain very polite, no cheers, applause, no untoward outbursts, except right at this minute now, as we welcome Governor Palin and Senator Biden."

The House of Representatives this week passed a bill, a big bailout bill  or didnt pass it, I should say. The Senate decided to pass it, and the House is wrestling with it still tonight."

      "dialogue": "Let me begin by thanking you, Gwen, for hosting this. And, Governor, its a pleasure to meet you, and its a pleasure to be with you. I think its neither the best or worst of Washington, but its evidence of the fact that the economic policies of the last eight years have been the worst economic policies weve ever had. As a consequence, youve seen whats happened on Wall Street. If you need any more proof positive of how bad the economic theories have been, this excessive deregulation, the failure to oversee what was going on, letting Wall Street run wild, I dont think you needed any more evidence than what you see now. So the Congress has been put  Democrats and Republicans have been put in a very difficult spot. But Barack Obama laid out four basic criteria for any kind of rescue plan here. He, first of all, said there has to be oversight. Were not going to write any check to anybody unless theres oversight for the  of the secretary of Treasury. He secondly said you have to focus on homeowners and folks on Main Street. Thirdly, he said that you have to treat the taxpayers like investors in this case. And, lastly, what you have to do is make sure that CEOs dont benefit from this, because this could end up, in the long run, people making money off of this rescue plan. And so, as a consequence of that, it brings us back to maybe the fundamental disagreement between Governor Palin and me and Senator McCain and Barack Obama, and that is that the  were going to fundamentally change the focus of the economic policy. Were going to focus on the middle class, because its  when the middle class is growing, the economy grows and everybody does well, not just focus on the wealthy and corporate America."

      "dialogue": "Thank you, Gwen. And I thank the commission, also. I appreciate this privilege of being able to be here and speak with Americans. Fear about, how are we going to afford to send our kids to college? A fear, as small-business owners, perhaps, how were going to borrow any money to increase inventory or hire more people. The barometer there, I think, is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve, and we need reform to that end. Now, John McCain thankfully has been one representing reform. Two years ago, remember, it was John McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures. He sounded that warning bell. People in the Senate with him, his colleagues, didnt want to listen to him and wouldnt go towards that reform that was needed then. I think that the alarm has been heard, though, and there will be that greater oversight, again thanks to John McCains bipartisan efforts that he was so instrumental in bringing folks together over this past week, even suspending his own campaign to make sure he was putting excessive politics aside and putting the country first."

Two weeks before that, he said George  weve made great economic progress under George Bushs policies. Nine oclock, the economy was strong. Eleven oclock that same day, two Mondays ago, John McCain said that we have an economic crisis. That doesnt make John McCain a bad guy, but it does point out hes out of touch.

And the American workforce is the greatest in this world, with the ingenuity and the work ethic that is just entrenched in our workforce. Thats a positive. Thats encouragement. And thats what John McCain meant. Now, what Ive done as a governor and as a mayor is (inaudible) Ive had that track record of reform. And Ive joined this team that is a team of mavericks with John McCain, also, with his track record of reform, where were known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done. Now, Barack Obama, of course, hes pretty much only voted along his party lines. In fact, 96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line, not having that proof for the American people to know that his commitment, too, is, you know, put the partisanship, put the special interests aside, and get down to getting business done for the people of America. Were tired of the old politics as usual. And thats why, with all due respect, I do respect your years in the U.S. Senate, but I think Americans are craving something new and different and that new energy and that new commitment thats going to come with reform. I think thats why we need to send the maverick from the Senate and put him in the White House, and Im happy to join him there."

Never will we be exploited and taken advantage of again by those who are managing our money and loaning us these dollars. We need to make sure that we demand from the federal government strict oversight of those entities in charge of our investments and our savings and we need also to not get ourselves in debt. Lets do what our parents told us before we probably even got that first credit card. Dont live outside of our means. We need to make sure that as individuals were taking personal responsibility through all of this. Its not the American peoples fault that the economy is hurting like it is, but we have an opportunity to learn a heck of a lot of good lessons through this and say never again will we be taken advantage of."

      "dialogue": "Well Gwen, two years ago Barack Obama warned about the sub prime mortgage crisis. John McCain said shortly after that in December he was surprised there was a sub prime mortgage problem. John McCain while Barack Obama was warning about what we had to do was literally giving an interview to The Wall Street Journal saying that Im always for cutting regulations. We let Wall Street run wild. John McCain and hes a good man, but John McCain thought the answer is that tried and true Republican response, deregulate, deregulate. So what you had is you had overwhelming deregulation. You had actually the belief that Wall Street could self-regulate itself. And while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations, John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation. As a matter of fact, John recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health care industry deregulate it and let the free market move like he did for the banking industry. So deregulation was the promise. And guess what? Those people who say dont go into debt, they can barely pay to fill up their gas tank. I was recently at my local gas station and asked a guy named Joey Danco (ph). I said Joey, how much did it cost to fill your tank? You know what his answer was? He said I dont know, Joe. I never have enough money to do it. The middle class needs relief, tax relief. They need it now. They need help now. The focus will change with Barack Obama."

      "dialogue": "I would like to respond about the tax increases. We can speak in agreement here that darn right we need tax relief for Americans so that jobs can be created here. Now, Barack Obama and Senator Biden also voted for the largest tax increases in U.S. history. Barack had 94 opportunities to side on the peoples side and reduce taxes and 94 times he voted to increase taxes or not support a tax reduction, 94 times. Now, thats not what we need to create jobs and really bolster and heat up our economy. We do need the private sector to be able to keep more of what we earn and produce. Government is going to have to learn to be more efficient and live with less if thats what it takes to reign in the government growth that weve seen today. But we do need tax relief and Barack Obama even supported increasing taxes as late as last year for those families making only $42,000 a year. Thats a lot of middle income average American families to increase taxes on them. I think that is the way to kill jobs and to continue to harm our economy."

John McCain voted the same way. It did not raise taxes. Number two, using the standard that the governor uses, John McCain voted 477 times to raise taxes. Its a bogus standard it but if you notice, Gwen, the governor did not answer the question about deregulation, did not answer the question of defending John McCain about not going along with the deregulation, letting Wall Street run wild. He did support deregulation almost across the board. Thats why we got into so much trouble."

And I may not answer the questions the way that either the moderator or you want to hear, but Im going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also. As mayor, every year I was in office I did reduce taxes. I eliminated personal property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state fuel tax. We did all of those things knowing that that is how our economy would be heated up. Now, as for John McCains adherence to rules and regulations and pushing for even harder and tougher regulations, that is another thing that he is known for though. Look at the tobacco industry. Look at campaign finance reform."

    {
      "actor": "Ifill",

You proposed raising taxes on people who earn over $250,000 a year. The question for you is, why is that not class warfare and the same question for you, Governor Palin, is you have proposed a tax employer health benefits which some studies say would actually throw five million more people onto the roles of the uninsured. I want to know why that isnt taking things out on the poor, starting with you, Senator Biden."
    },
    {
      "actor": "Biden",
      "dialogue": "Well Gwen, where I come from, its called fairness, just simple fairness. The middle class is struggling. The middle class under John McCains tax proposal, 100 million families, middle class families, households to be precise, they got not a single change, they got not a single break in taxes. No one making less than $250,000 under Barack Obamas plan will see one single penny of their tax raised whether its their capital gains tax, their income tax, investment tax, any tax. And 95 percent of the people in the United States of America making less than $150,000 will get a tax break. Now, that seems to me to be simple fairness. The economic engine of America is middle class. Its the people listening to this broadcast. When you do well, America does well. Even the wealthy do well. This is not punitive. John wants to add $300 million, billion in new tax cuts per year for corporate America and the very wealthy while giving virtually nothing to the middle class. We have a different value set. The middle class is the economic engine. Its fair. They deserve the tax breaks, not the super wealthy who are doing pretty well. They dont need any more tax breaks. And by the way, theyll pay no more than they did under Ronald Reagan."

    {
      "actor": "Palin",
      "dialogue": "I do take issue with some of the principle there with that redistribution of wealth principle that seems to be espoused by you. But when you talk about Baracks plan to tax increase affecting only those making $250,000 a year or more, youre forgetting millions of small businesses that are going to fit into that category. So theyre going to be the ones paying higher taxes thus resulting in fewer jobs being created and less productivity. Now you said recently that higher taxes or asking for higher taxes or paying higher taxes is patriotic. In the middle class of America which is where Todd and I have been all of our lives, thats not patriotic. Patriotic is saying, government, you know, youre not always the solution. In fact, too often youre the problem so, government, lessen the tax burden and on our families and get out of the way and let the private sector and our families grow and thrive and prosper. An increased tax formula that Barack Obama is proposing in addition to nearly a trillion dollars in new spending that hes proposing is the backwards way of trying to grow our economy."

    },
    {
      "actor": "Palin",
      "dialogue": "I am because hes got a good health care plan that is detailed. And I want to give you a couple details on that. Hes proposing a $5,000 tax credit for families so that they can get out there and they can purchase their own health care coverage. Thats a smart thing to do. Thats budget neutral. That doesnt cost the government anything as opposed to Barack Obamas plan to mandate health care coverage and have universal government run program and unless youre pleased with the way the federal government has been running anything lately, I dont think that its going to be real pleasing for Americans to consider health care being taken over by the feds. But a $5,000 health care credit through our income tax thats budget neutral. Thats going to help. And he also wants to erase those artificial lines between states so that through competition, we can cross state lines and if theres a better plan offered somewhere else, we would be able to purchase that. So affordability and accessibility will be the keys there with that $5,000 tax credit also being offered."

    {
      "actor": "Biden",
      "dialogue": "Gwen, I dont know where to start. We dont call a redistribution in my neighborhood Scranton, Claymont, Wilmington, the places I grew up, to give the fair to say that not giving Exxon Mobil another $4 billion tax cut this year as John calls for and giving it to middle class people to be able to pay to get their kids to college, we dont call that redistribution. We call that fairness number one. Number two fact, 95 percent of the small businesses in America, their owners make less than $250,000 a year. They would not get one single solitary penny increase in taxes, those small businesses."
    },
    {
      "actor": "Biden",
      "dialogue": "Now, with regard to the  to the health care plan, you know, its with one hand you giveth, the other you take it. You know how Barack Obama  excuse me, do you know how John McCain pays for his $5,000 tax credit youre going to get, a family will get? He taxes as income every one of you out there, every one of you listening who has a health care plan through your employer. Thats how he raises $3.6 trillion, on your  taxing your health care benefit to give you a $5,000 plan, which his Web site points out will go straight to the insurance company. And then youre going to have to replace a $12,000  thats the average cost of the plan you get through your employer  it costs $12,000. Youre going to have to pay  replace a $12,000 plan, because 20 million of you are going to be dropped. Twenty million of you will be dropped. So youre going to have to place  replace a $12,000 plan with a $5,000 check you just give to the insurance company. I call that the Ultimate Bridge to Nowhere."

We also are going to make sure that we do not go forward with the tax cut proposals of the administration  of John McCain, the existing one for people making over $250,000, which is $130 billion this year alone. Were not going to support the $300 billion tax cut that they have for corporate America and the very wealthy. Were not going to support another $4 billion tax cut for ExxonMobil. And what were not going to also hold up on, Gwen, is we cannot afford to hold up on providing for incentives for new jobs by an energy policy, creating new jobs. We cannot slow up on education, because thats the engine that is going to give us the economic growth and competitiveness that we need. And we are not going to slow up on the whole idea of providing for affordable health care for Americans, none of which, when we get to talk about health care, is as my  as the governor characterized  characterized. The bottom line here is that we are going to, in fact, eliminate those wasteful spending that exist in the budget right now, a number of things I dont have time, because the light is blinking, that I wont be able to mention, but one of which is the $100 billion tax dodge that, in fact, allows people to take their post office box off- shore, avoid taxes.

I want to go back to the energy plan, though, because this is  this is an important one that Barack Obama, he voted for in 05. Senator Biden, you would remember that, in that energy plan that Obama voted for, thats what gave those oil companies those big tax breaks. Your running mate voted for that. You know what I had to do in the state of Alaska? I had to take on those oil companies and tell them, No, you know, any of the greed there that has been kind of instrumental, I guess, in their mode of operation, that wasnt going to happen in my state. And thats why Tillerson at Exxon and Mulva at ConocoPhillips, bless their hearts, theyre doing what they need to do, as corporate CEOs, but theyre not my biggest fans, because what I had to do up there in Alaska was to break up a monopoly up there and say, you know, the people are going to come first and were going to make sure that we have value given to the people of Alaska with those resources. And those huge tax breaks arent coming to the big multinational corporations anymore, not when it adversely affects the people who live in a state and, in this case, in a country who should be benefiting at the same time. So it was Barack Obama who voted for that energy plan that gave those tax breaks to the oil companies that I then had to turn around, as a governor of an energy-producing state, and kind of undo in my own area of expertise, and thats energy."

When there were separate votes on eliminating the tax breaks for the oil companies, Barack Obama voted to eliminate them. John did not. And, look, I agree with the governor. She imposed a windfall profits tax up there in Alaska. Thats what Barack Obama and I want to do. We want to be able to do for all of you Americans, give you back $1,000 bucks, like shes been able to give back money to her folks back there. But John McCain will not support a windfall profits tax. Theyve made $600 billion since 2001, and John McCain wants to give them, all by itself  separate, no additional bill, all by itself  another $4 billion tax cut. If that is not proof of what I say, Im not sure what can be.

But here, again, there have  there have been so many changes in the conditions of our economy in just even these past weeks that there has been more and more revelation made aware now to Americans about the corruption and the greed on Wall Street. We need to look back, even two years ago, and we need to be appreciative of John McCains call for reform with Fannie Mae, with Freddie Mac, with the mortgage-lenders, too, who were starting to really kind of rear that head of abuse. And the colleagues in the Senate werent going to go there with him. So we have John McCain to thank for at least warning people. And we also have John McCain to thank for bringing in a bipartisan effort people to the table so that we can start putting politics aside, even putting a campaign aside, and just do whats right to fix this economic problem that we are in. It is a crisis. Its a toxic mess, really, on Main Street thats affecting Wall Street. And now we have to be ever vigilant and also making sure that credit markets dont seize up.

But the point of this  Barack Obama saw the glass as half- empty. I saw it as half-full. We disagreed on that, and 85 senators voted one way, and 15 voted the other way. But heres the deal. Barack Obama pointed out two years ago that there was a subprime mortgage crisis and wrote to the secretary of Treasury. And he said, Youd better get on the stick here. Youd better look at it. John McCain said as early as last December, quote  Im paraphrasing  Im surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis, number one. Number two, with regard to bankruptcy now, Gwen, what we should be doing now  and Barack Obama and I support it  we should be allowing bankruptcy courts to be able to re-adjust not just the interest rate youre paying on your mortgage to be able to stay in your home, but be able to adjust the principal that you owe, the principal that you owe. That would keep people in their homes, actually help banks by keeping it from going under. But John McCain, as I understand it  Im not sure of this, but I believe John McCain and the governor dont support that. There are ways to help people now. And there  ways that were offering are not being supported by  by the Bush administration nor do I believe by John McCain and Governor Palin."

I think that this is important to come back to, with that energy policy plan again that was voted for in 05. When we talk about energy, we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become energy independent. Its a nonsensical position that we are in when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great land. And East Coast politicians who dont allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce these, to tap into them, and instead were relying on foreign countries to produce for us."

Energy independence is the key to this nations future, to our economic future, and to our national security. So when we talk about energy plans, its not just about who got a tax break and who didnt.

There is something to be said also for mans activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet. We have got to clean up this planet. We have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us with the impacts of climate change, what we can do about that. As governor, I was the first governor to form a climate change sub-cabinet to start dealing with the impacts. Weve got to reduce emissions. John McCain is right there with an all of the above approach to deal with climate change impacts. Weve got to become energy independent for that reason. Also as we rely more and more on other countries that dont care as much about the climate as we do, were allowing them to produce and to emit and even pollute more than America would ever stand for. So even in dealing with climate change, its all the more reason that we have an all of the above approach, tapping into alternative sources of energy and conserving fuel, conserving our petroleum products and our hydrocarbons so that we can clean up this planet and deal with climate change."

If you dont understand what the cause is, its virtually impossible to come up with a solution. We know what the cause is. The cause is manmade. Thats the cause. Thats why the polar icecap is melting. Now, lets look at the facts. We have 3 percent of the worlds oil reserves. We consume 25 percent of the oil in the world. John McCain has voted 20 times in the last decade-and-a-half against funding alternative energy sources, clean energy sources, wind, solar, biofuels. The way in which we can stop the greenhouse gases from emitting. We believe  Barack Obama believes by investing in clean coal and safe nuclear, we can not only create jobs in wind and solar here in the United States, we can export it. China is building one to three new coal-fired plants burning dirty coal per week. Its polluting not only the atmosphere but the West Coast of the United States. We should export the technology by investing in clean coal technology. We should be creating jobs. John McCain has voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks, I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill.

And were building a nearly $40 billion natural gas pipeline which is North Americas largest and most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets. Barack Obama and Senator Biden, youve said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy crisis that were in. You even called drilling  safe, environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf. There  with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that. But also in that all of the above approach that Senator McCain supports, the alternative fuels will be tapped into: the nuclear, the clean coal.

John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops.

Barack Obama and I agree fully and completely on one thing: Youve got to have a time line to draw down the troops and shift responsibility to the Iraqis.

Barack says its time for them to spend their own money and have the 400,000 military we trained for them begin to take their own responsibility and gradually over six months  16 months, withdrawal.

Iran getting a nuclear weapon would be very, very destabilizing. They are more than  they are not close to getting a nuclear weapon thats able to be deployed. So theyre both very dangerous. They both would be game changers. But look, heres what the fundamental problem I have with Johns policy about terror instability. John continues to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in Iraq. I promise you, if an attack comes in the homeland, its going to come as our security services have said, it is going to come from al Qaeda planning in the hills of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thats where they live. Thats where they are. Thats where it will come from. And right now that resides in Pakistan. A stable government needs to be established. We need to support that democracy by helping them not only with their military but with their governance and their economic well-being. There have been 7,000 madrasses built along that border.

You dont have to believe me or John McCain on that. I would believe Petraeus and that leader of al Qaeda. An armed, nuclear armed especially, Iran is so extremely dangerous to consider. They cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons period. Israel is in jeopardy of course when were dealing with Ahmadinejad as a leader of Iran. Iran claiming that Israel is, he termed it, a stinking corpse, a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth. Now a leader like Ahmadinejad who is not sane or stable when he says things like that is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy, nuclear weapons. Ahmadinejad, Kim Jong Il, the Castro brothers, others who are dangerous dictators are ones that Barack Obama has said he would be willing to meet with without preconditions being met first. An issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment.

He said we need more troops. We need government-building. We need to spend more money on the infrastructure in Afghanistan.

And initially John McCain opposed it along with a lot of other people. But the end result was it worked. Look what we did in Bosnia. We took Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks, being told by everyone, I was told by everyone that this would mean that they had been killing each other for a thousand years, it would never work. Theres a relatively stable government there now as in Kosovo. With regard to Iraq, I indicated it would be a mistake to  I gave the president the power. I voted for the power because he said he needed it not to go to war but to keep the United States, the UN in line, to keep sanctions on Iraq and not let them be lifted. I, along with Dick Lugar, before we went to war, said if we were to go to war without our allies, without the kind of support we need, wed be there for a decade and itd cost us tens of billions of dollars. John McCain said, no, it was going to be OK. I dont have the stomach for genocide when it comes to Darfur. We can now impose a no-fly zone. Its within our capacity. We can lead NATO if were willing to take a hard stand. We can, Ive been in those camps in Chad. Ive seen the suffering, thousands and tens of thousands have died and are dying. We should rally the world to act and demonstrate it by our own movement to provide the helicopters to get the 21,000 forces of the African Union in there now to stop this genocide."

Americans are craving that straight talk and just want to know, hey, if you voted for it, tell us why you voted for it and it was a war resolution. And you had supported John McCains military strategies pretty adamantly until this race and you had opposed very adamantly Barack Obamas military strategy, including cutting off funding for the troops that attempt all through the primary. And I watched those debates, so I remember what those were all about. But as for as Darfur, we can agree on that also, the supported of the no-fly zone, making sure that all options are on the table there also. America is in a position to help. What Ive done in my position to help, as the governor of a state thats pretty rich in natural resources, we have a $40 billion investment fund, a savings fund called the Alaska Permanent Fund. When I and others in the legislature found out we had some millions of dollars in Sudan, we called for divestment through legislation of those dollars to make sure we werent doing anything that would be seen as condoning the activities there in Darfur. That legislation hasnt passed yet but it needs to because all of us, as individuals, and as humanitarians and as elected officials should do all we can to end those atrocities in that region of the world."

When a country engages in genocide, when a country engaging in harboring terrorists and will do nothing about it, at that point that country in my view and Baracks view forfeits their right to say you have no right to intervene at all. The truth of the matter is, though, lets go back to John McCains strategy. I never supported John McCains strategy on the war. John McCain said exactly what Dick Cheney said, go back and look at Barack Obamas statements and mine. Go look at joebiden.com, contemporaneously, held hearings in the summer before we went to war, saying if we went to war, we would not be greeted as liberator, we would have a fight between Sunnis and Shias, we would be tied down for a decade and cost us hundreds of billions of dollars. John McCain was saying the exact opposite. John McCain was lock- step with Dick Cheney at that point how this was going to be easy.

A policy that would in fact engage our allies in making sure that we knew we were acting on the same page and not dictating.

I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years, and god bless her. Her reward is in heaven, right? I say, too, with education, America needs to be putting a lot more focus on that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving. Teachers needed to be paid more. I come from a house full of school teachers. My grandma was, my dad who is in the audience today, hes a schoolteacher, had been for many years. My brother, who I think is the best schoolteacher in the year, and heres a shout-out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School, you get extra credit for watching the debate. Education in America has been in some sense in some of our states just accepted to be a little bit lax, and we have got to increase the standards. No Child Left Behind was implemented. Its not doing the job though. We need flexibility in No Child Left Behind. We need to put more of an emphasis on the profession of teaching. We need to make sure that education in either one of our agendas, I think, absolute top of the line. My kids as public school participants right now, its near and dear to my heart.

With regard to the role of vice president, I had a long talk, as Im sure the governor did with her principal, in my case with Barack. And let me tell you what Barack asked me to do. I have a history of getting things done in the United States Senate. John McCain would acknowledge that. My record shows that on controversial issues. I would be the point person for the legislative initiatives in the United States Congress for our administration. I would also, when asked if I wanted a portfolio, my response was, no. But Barack Obama indicated to me he wanted me with him to help him govern. So every major decision hell be making, Ill be sitting in the room to give him my best advice. Hes president, not me, Ill give my best advice. And one of the things he said early on when he was choosing, he said he picked someone who had an independent judgment and wouldnt be afraid to tell him if he disagreed.

And the primary role of the vice president of the United States of America is to support the president of the United States of America, give that president his or her best judgment when sought, and as vice president, to preside over the Senate, only in a time when in fact theres a tie vote. The Constitution is explicit. The only authority the vice president has from the legislative standpoint is the vote, only when there is a tie vote. He has no authority relative to the Congress.

About times and Todd and our marriage in our past where we didnt have health insurance and we know what other Americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out, how are they going to pay out-of-pocket for health care? Weve been there also so that connection was important. But even more important is that worldview that I share with John McCain. That worldview that says that America is a nation of exceptionalism. And we are to be that shining city on a hill, as President Reagan so beautifully said, that we are a beacon of hope and that we are unapologetic here. We are not perfect as a nation. But together, we represent a perfect ideal, and that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights. Those things that we stand for that can be put to good use as a force for good in this world.

Id rather be able to just speak to the American people like we just did. And its so important that the American people know of the choices that they have on November 4th. I want to assure you that John McCain and I, were going to fight for America. Were going to fight for the middle-class, average, everyday American family like mine. Ive been there. I know what the hurts are. I know what the challenges are. And, thank God, I know what the joys are, too, of living in America. We are so blessed. And Ive always been proud to be an American. And so has John McCain. We have to fight for our freedoms, also, economic and our national security freedoms. It was Ronald Reagan who said that freedom is always just one generation away from extinction. We dont pass it to our children in the bloodstream; we have to fight for it and protect it, and then hand it to them so that they shall do the same, or were going to find ourselves spending our sunset years telling our children and our childrens children about a time in America, back in the day, when men and women were free. We will fight for it, and there is only one man in this race who has really ever fought for you, and thats Senator John McCain."

      "dialogue": "Gwen, thank you for doing this, and the commission, and Governor, it really was a pleasure getting to meet you. Look, folks, this is the most important election youve ever voted in your entire life. No one can deny that the last eight years, weve been dug into a very deep hole here at home with regard to our economy, and abroad in terms of our credibility. And theres a need for fundamental change in our economic philosophy, as well as our foreign policy. And Barack Obama and I dont measure progress toward that change based on whether or not we cut more regulations and how well CEOs are doing, or giving another $4 billion in tax breaks to the Exxon Mobils of the world. We measure progress in America based on whether or not someone can pay their mortgage, whether or not they can send their kid to college, whether or not theyre able to, when they send their child, like we have abroad  or Im about to, abroad  and John has as well, I might add  to fight, that they are the best equipped and they have everything they need. And when they come home, theyre guaranteed that they have the best health care and the best education possible. You know, in the neighborhood I grew up in, it was all about dignity and respect. A neighborhood like most of you grew up in. And in that neighborhood, it was filled with women and men, mothers and fathers who taught their children if they believed in themselves, if they were honest, if they worked hard, if they loved their country, they could accomplish anything. We believed it, and we did. Thats why Barack Obama and I are running, to re-establish that certitude in our neighborhoods. Ladies and gentlemen, my dad used to have an expression. Hed say, champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Well, its time for America to get up together. Americas ready, youre ready, Im ready, and Barack Obama is ready to be the next president of the United States of America. May God bless all of you, and most of all, for both of us, selfishly, may God protect our troops."
