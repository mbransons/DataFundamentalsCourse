      "dialogue": "Good evening, and welcome to the first of 3 debates among the major candidates for president of the United States, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The candidates are: independent candidate Ross Perot, Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and President George Bush, the Republican nominee. I am Jim Lehrer of the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour on PBS, and I will be the moderator for this 90-minute event, which is taking place before an audience in the athletic complex on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Three journalists will be asking questions tonight. They are John Mashek of The Boston Globe, Ann Compton of ABC News, and Sander Vanocur, a freelance journalist. We will follow a format agreed to by representatives of the Clinton and Bush campaigns. That agreement contains no restrictions on the content or subject matter of the questions. Each candidate will have up to 2 minutes for a closing statement. The order of those, as well as the questioning, was determined by a drawing. The first question goes to Mr. Perot. He will have 2 minutes to answer, to be followed by rebuttals of one minute each from Governor Clinton and then President Bush. Gentlemen, good evening. The first topic tonight is what separates each of you from the other. Mr. Perot, what do you believe tonight is the single most important separating issue of this campaign?"

      "dialogue": "I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot. I was not put on the ballot by either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money. This is a movement that came from the people. This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people. Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature. The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them. I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them. So this comes from the people."

But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide. Tonight I say to the President: Mr. Bush, for 12 years youve had it your way. Youve had your chance and it didnt work. Its time to change. I want to bring that change to the American people. But we must all decide first we have the courage to change for hope and a better tomorrow."

Ill talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace. Kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war. And change for change sake isnt enough. We saw that message in the late 70s when heard a lot about change, and what happened, that misery index went right through the roof. But my economic program is the kind of change we want. And the way were going to get it done is were going to have a brand new Congress. A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals. Ill sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change. But Id say, if you had to separate out, I think its experience at this level."

Ive worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people. My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine. Thats because we believe in investing in education and in jobs. And we have to change in this country. You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We have got to have the courage to change. Experience is important, yes. Ive gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month. Ive touched more peoples lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else whos run for president this year. I think the American people deserve better than theyre getting. We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in. Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder. In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created. We need a new approach. The same old experience is not relevant. Were living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together. That is what works. And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience. Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change."

He thinks, I think he said, that the country is coming apart at the seams. Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economys worse than it is. But this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heavens sakes. Were the United States of America. In spite of the economic problems, were the most respected economy around the world. Many would trade for it. Weve been caught up in a global slowdown. We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country thats coming apart at the seams. I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are. Yes, there are big problems, and yes, people are hurting. But I believe that this Agenda for American renewal I have is the answer to do it, and I believe we can get it done now, whereas we didnt in the past, because youre going to have a whole brand new bunch of people in the Congress that are going to have to listen to the same American people Im listening to."

I dont have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world. But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done. So, if were at a point in history where we want to stop talking about it and do it, Ive got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems, making the solutions work, and then moving on to the next one. Ive got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem. So, if its time for action, I think I have experience that counts.

I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned  I put it this way; I think its wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil. I just think its wrong. I  well, maybe they say, Well, it was a youthful indiscretion. I was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. And Im sorry, but demonstrating  its not a question of patriotism. Its a question of character and judgment. They get on me  Bills gotten on me about, read my lips. When I make a mistake Ill admit it. But he has made  not admitted a mistake and I just find it impossible to understand how an American can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land  organizing demonstrations against it when young men are held prisoner in Hanoi or kids out of the ghetto were drafted. Some say, well, youre a little old fashioned. Maybe I am, but I just dont think thats right. Now, whether its character or judgment  whatever it is  I have a big difference here on this issue and so well just have to see how it plays out. But I  I couldnt do that. And I dont think most Americans could do that. And they all say, Well, it was a long time ago. Well, lets admit it then. Say, I made a terrible mistake. How could you be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and have some kid say  when you have to make a tough decision, as I did in Panama or Kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say, Well, Im not going to go. The Commander-in-Chief was organizing demonstrations halfway around the world during another era. So there are differences but thats about the main area where I think we have a difference. I dont know about  well talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit."

I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way. Then, make a decision. Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there. But, I think its very important to measure when and where things occurred. Did they occur when you were a young person, in your formative years? Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government? When youre a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars in taxpayers money and youre a mature individual and you make a mistake, then that was on our ticket. If you make it as a young man, time passes. So I would say just, you know, look at all three of us. Decide who you think will do the job. Pick that person in November because believe me, as Ive said before, The partys over and its time for the clean-up crew. And we do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when it happens on their watch and people who are in charge"

Then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60,000. In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper-income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper-income people. I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit, like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early 60s to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low-income housing tax credit; a long-term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions. Weve got to have no more trickle down. We dont need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing. We need to say heres your tax incentive: if you create American jobs, the old-fashioned way. Id like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I dont want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and thats whats happened in the last 4 years. Were down 35,000 jobs in the private sector. We need to invest and grow, and thats what I want to do."

He did. I accept that. What I dont accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your countrys at war. Im sorry. I cannot accept that. In terms of this one on taxes spells out the biggest difference between us. I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend. Governor Clinton says $200,000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion. Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion. And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man. That old adage they usewere going to soak the rich- -were going to soak the richit always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill. And so I just have a different approach. I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people. Weve got a big difference there."

Now, why, almost 50 years after the end of World War II, and with the total collapse of the Soviet Union, should American taxpayers be taxed to support armies in Europe when the Europeans have plenty of money to do it for themselves?"
    },
    {
      "actor": "Bush",
      "dialogue": "Well, Sander, thats a good question, and the answer is: for 40-some years we kept the peace. If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant. We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed. I have cut defense spending. And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War. We never would have got there if we had gone for the nuclear freeze crowd; we never would have got there if we had listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending. I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace. We simply cannot pull back. Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, lets cut money out of the Defense Dept. I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney. They feel that the levels were operating at and the reductions that I have proposed are proper. And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners. We are the sole remaining superpower, and we should be that. And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility. But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace. And I dont want to do that. Ive seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I dont want to see us make reckless cuts. Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending. But lets not cut into the muscle, and lets not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made. Today youve got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europes gone democracys route. But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary. I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels weve come up with are just about right."

Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe. For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years. Its kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $30-billion tab to defend your country. The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past. I agree with the president: when they couldnt, we should have; now that they can, they should. We sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it. They dont want us to control it, very candidly. So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base."

There are certainly dangers there, there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the US. But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagans former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci. Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed. Were going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B-22 airplane. Were going to have to do some things that are quite costly. And I simply dont believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded. I dont think we need 150,000 troops. Let me make one other point. Mr. Bush talked about taxes. He didnt tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy."

Were trying to solve it. Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs. We collect 35 cents, and we dont have it to spend. I know its not popular, and I understand the nature of your question. But the people who will be helped the most by it are the working people who will get the jobs created because of this tax. Why do we have to do it? Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler. And if we dont, we will be spending our childrens money. We have spent $4 trillion worth. An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them. I think its fitting that were on the campus of a university tonight. These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job. Weve got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them. Weve got to collect the taxes to do it. If theres a fairer way, Im all ears (laughter) aah. (Laughter and applause) Butbutsee, let me make it very clear. If people dont have the stomach to fix these problems, I think its a good time to face it, November.

People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our peoplea $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years. The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists whove looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy. Thats why I think we shouldnt do it that quickly. We have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 % over the next 4 years, but first get incentives to invest in this economy, put the American people back to work. Weve got to invest and grow. 9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling."

You see, I have a fundamental difference. I agree with what hes talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security. But hes talking tough medicine, and I think thats good. I disagree with the tax-and-spend philosophy. You see, I dont think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say thats going to make the problem better. And Im afraid thats what I think Im hearing from Governor Clinton. I believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about: control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down. Hes mentioned some ways to do itand I agree with those. Ive been talking about getting a capital gains cut forever, and his friends in Congress have been telling me thats a tax break for the rich. It would stimulate investment. Im for an investment tax allowance; Im for a tax break for first- time homebuyers. And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and Ill sit down with them and say lets get this done.

In todays Post- Dispatch, a retired saleswoman, a 75-year-old woman named Marjorie Roberts, asked if she could ask a question of the candidates. She said she wanted to register her concern about the lack of a plan to convert our defense-oriented industries into other purposes. How would you answer her."

I think its a good decisiontook a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do. And we worked it out, and indeed were moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way. So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people. I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining. When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work. If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, youre going to put a lot more out of work. I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that were proposing. Therein is the best answer to her. And another one is: stimulate investment and savings. I mean, weve got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; were ready for a recovery. With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs Ive talked about and if you help with job retraining and education. I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answera little longer run; its going to take awhile to educate. But it is a good program. So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant. But tell her its not all that gloomy; were the US, we faced tough problems before. Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress. It was just right through the roof. Now, we can do better. And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs. Im much more optimistic about this country than some."

Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan. Weve given away whole industries. So as we phase these industries over, theres a whole of intellectual talent in these industries. A lot of these people in industries can be converted to the industries of tomorrow, and thats where the high-paying jobs are. We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over. Now, see, we practice 19th century capitalism. The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism. I cant handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later.

There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes. Its like having a blueprint for a house you never built. You dont have anywhere to sleep. Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them. Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that. The second, youve got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industrieshave another one on that. Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they dont wind up in Europe and Asia. Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism. See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business. Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship. Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety. Health care, schoolsone on the debt and deficit. And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present. Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans. By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress. Then get off to a flying start in 93 to execute these plans. Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage whove been in meetings when I would sit there and say, Is this the one were going to talk about or do something about? Well, obviously, my orientation is lets go do it. Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things. Small businessyouve got to have capital, youve got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches. And we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place."

Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans. Until we control health care costs, were not going to control the deficit. It is the number one culprit. But first we must have an aggressive jobs program. I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bushs labor secretary said job growth has been enormous.

And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle-down economicsanother across-the- board tax cut and most of it going to the wealthy, with no real guarantee of investment. But I think the important thingthe important thing is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, were going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time. That is my commitment. I think the American people are ready for action. I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them. Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done. Give me a chance to do that.

There was a momentary fear that he might win and that the markets went phwee, down like that. So I dont think we can judge on, the stock market has been strong. Its been very strong since Ive been president. And they recognize we got great difficulties, but theyre also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight. In terms of vetoing tax bills, youre darn right. I am going to protect the American taxpayer against the spend and tax Congress. And Im going to keep on vetoing them, because I dont think were taxed too little. I think the governments spending too much. So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants.

So seventy percent of our debt is five years or less. Its very interest sensitive. We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries. That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money. Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt. Whichever place you put it.

And you cant convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency. See, Willow Run could be converted from cars to airplanes in World War II because it was here. Weve got to make things here. You cant ship them overseas anymore. I hope we can talk more about that. Second thing, on priorities. Weve got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics. When we think of Russia, remember were thinking of many countries, now. Weve got to help them. Thats pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war. Third, weve got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads. Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now. Its a very unstable situation. Youve got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons. As you well know. And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road. We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia. And weve focused on the tactical. Weve made real progress there. Weve got some agreement on the nuclear, but we dont have those things put away yet. The sooner the better. So, in terms of priorities, weve got to be financially strong. Number two, weve got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority. And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil.

We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States. We need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Second, we have to face that in this world, economic security is a whole lot of national security. Our dollars at an all time low against some foreign currencies. Were weak in the world. We must rebuild Americas strength at home.

I mean, thats been done. And thank God, it has, because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war. We made dramatic progress. And so, weve got a good military. the question, to sort of get a new military, get the best in the world, we got it, and theyre keeping the peace, and theyre respected around the world. And were more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves. We didnt listen to the nuclear freeze crowd. We said, Peace through strength, and it worked and the cold war is over. And America understands that. But were so, turned so inward we dont understand the global picture. And we are helping democracy, Ross.

That was their response to that sort of action. Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened. China has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor. Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it. And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush. The second biggest surplus next to Japan. So I would be firm. I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future. Open your society.

America has a lot of families that are in trouble today. Theres been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign. I know a lot about that. I was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values, and grandparents. Ive seen the family values of my people in Arkansas. Ive seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country thats had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever. I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values Americas families, whether theyre people on welfare youre trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if theyve got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy. And I think they deserve a family and medical leave act. Seventy-two other nations have been able to do it. Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he says we cant do something seventy-two other countries do, even though there was a small business exemption. So with all the talk about family values, I know about family values  I wouldnt be here without them.

And I think, my gosh, wouldnt it be wonderful if every child had that love and support. But they dont. We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home. And I think you can use the White House as a bully pulpit to stress the importance of these little children, particularly in their young and formative years, to mold these little precious pieces of clay so that they, too, can live rich full lives when theyre grown."

I do believe that theres some fairly good news out there. The use of cocaine, for example, by teenagers is dramatically down. But weve got to keep fighting on this war against drugs. Were doing a little better in interdiction. Many of the countries below that used to say, well, this is the US problem  if youd get the demand down, then we wouldnt have the problem  are working cooperatively with the DEA and the military. Were using the military more now in terms of interdiction. Our funding for recovery is up, recovering the addicts. Where were not making the progress, Sander, is in  were making it in teenagers, and thank God, because I thought what Ross said was most appropriate about these families and these children. But where were not making it is with the confirmed addicts. And Ill tell you one place thats working well, and that is the private sector  Jim Burke and this task force that he has, you may know about it. Ill tell the American people, but this man said Ill get you a million dollars a day in pro bono advertising, something thats very hard for the government to do. And he went out and he did it. And people are beginning to educate through this program, teaching these kids you shouldnt use drugs. So were still in the fight. But I must tell you, I think legalization of narcotics, or something of that nature, in the face of the medical evidence, would be totally counterproductive.

Just look at those little children, and if anybody can even think about legalizing drugs, theyve lost me. Now, lets look at priorities. You know, we went on the Libyan raid  do you remember that one?  because we were worried to death that Gaddafi might be building up chemical weapons. Weve got chemical warfare being conducted against our children on the streets in this country all day every day, and we dont have the will to stamp it out. Now, again, if I get up there, if you send me, were going to have some blunt talks about this, and were really going to get down in the trenches and say, is this one you want to talk about or fix, because talk wont do it, folks.

He is alive today because of the criminal justice system. Thats a mistake. What should we do? First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street. Thirty years ago, there were three policemen for every crime. Now there are three crimes for every policeman. We need a hundred thousand more police on the street. I have a plan for that. Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand. Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before theyre severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals. There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems.

My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS  ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim. I think that were showing the proper compassion and concern. So I cant tell you where its coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that weve got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem. Were funding them  I wish there was more money  but were funding them far more than any time in the past, and were going to keep on doing that. I dont know. I was a little disappointed in Magic because he came to me and I said, Now if you see something were not doing, get ahold of me. Call me, let me know. He went to one meeting, and then we heard that he was stepping down. So hes replaced by Mary Fisher who electrified the Republican Convention by talking about the compassion and the concern that we feel. It was a beautiful moment and I think shell do a first-class job on that commission. So I think the appeal is yes, we care. And the other thing is part of AIDS  its one of the few diseases where behavior matters. And I once called on somebody, Well, change your behavior. Is the behavior youre using prone to cause AIDS? Change the behavior. Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, Bush ought to change his behavior. You cant talk about it rationally. The extremes are hurting the AIDS cause. To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, Im sorry, I think it sets back the cause. We cannot move to the extreme. Weve got to care. Weve got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level. Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS.

If youre going to die, you dont have to go through this ten-year cycle that FDA goes through on new drugs. Believe me, people with AIDS are more than willing to take that risk. And we could be moving out to the human population a whole lot faster than we are on some of these new drugs. So I would think we can expedite the problem there. Let me go back a minute to racial divisiveness. The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there. 2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.

I have worked in my state to reduce teen pregnancy and illness among children. I know its tough.

The average senior citizen is spending a higher percentage of income on health care today than they were in 1965, before Medicare came in. The presidents got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years. But if you dont have the guts to control costs by changing the insurance system and taking on the bureaucracies and the regulation of health care in the private and public sector, you cant fix this problem. Costs will continue to spiral. And just remember this, folks. A lot of folks on Medicare are out there every day making the choice between food and medicine; not poor enough for Medicare-Medicaid, not wealthy enough to buy their medicine. Ive met them, people like Mary Annie and Edward Davis in Nashua, New Hampshire. All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine. So lets be careful.

I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I dont think we need to touch Social Security. What we do need to do, though, is control the growth of these mandatory programs. And Ross properly says, okay, theres some pain in that. But Governor Clinton refuses to touch that, simply refuses. So what weve got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line. And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether its Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is.

Mr. Bush is trying to run against Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter and everybody in the world but me in this race. I have proposed a managed competition plan for health care. I will say again: you cannot control health care costs simply by cutting Medicare. Look whats happened. The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid  weve done it in Arkansas under budget pressures. But what happens? More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases. If you dont control the health care costs of the entire system, you cannot get control of it. Look at our program. We set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers, not by the government. We provide for managed competition, not government models, in every states. And we control private and public health care costs. Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats  more Republicans than Democrats  said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade. Ive got a plan to control health care costs. But you cant just do it by cutting Medicare; you have to take on the insurance companies, the bureaucracies. And you have to have cost controls, yes. But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care. The Oregon plan is a good start if the federal government is going to continue to abandon its responsibilities. I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too. Im tired of being told we cant. I say we can. We can do better, and we must."

But the Americans with Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the most foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we do have something more than a technical problem. Governor Clinton clicked off the things  hes going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies. He failed to take on somebody else  the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against  these frivolous trial lawyers lawsuits that are running the costs of medical care up 25 to 50 billion. And he refuses to put anything, controls, on these crazy lawsuits. If you want to help somebody, dont run the costs up by making doctors have to have 5 or 6 tests where one would do for fear of being sued, or have somebody along the highway not stop to pick up a guy and help him because hes afraid a trial lawyer will come along and sue him.

Mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom, and look at the dramatic changes around the world. The Cold War is over. The Soviet Union is no more and were working with a democratic country. Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free. Take a look at the Middle East. We had to stand up against a tyrant. The US came together as we havent in many, many years. And we kicked this man out of Kuwait. And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East. Nobody would have dreamed it possible. And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war. Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust. All this is good. On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people  not change for the sake of change, tax and spend. We dont need to do that any more. What we need to do is empower people. We need to invest and save. We need to do better in education. We need to do better in job retraining. We need to expand our exports, and theyre going very, very well, indeed. And we need to strengthen the American family. I hope as president that Ive earned your trust. Ive admitted it when I make a mistake, but then I go on and help, try to solve the problems. I hope Ive earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character. And I ask for your support for 4 more years to finish this job. Thank you very, very much."
