    "The central goal of a critical view of data analytics is to cultivate data acumen or data discernment, the ability to make creative and sound judgements and decisions with data. Data acumen is a perspective based on the logic of inquiry, a way of seeing and understanding practices and processes in a multitude of contexts and professions. There is much talk these days of “data-driven decision-making” in organizations across a variety of institutional settings. Data acumen is a capacity to make good data-driven decisions.\n",

    "The 'public sphere' is the place of discussion and debate in a culture and society. What matters, what people are talking about... And the accessibility to this information... Who is the message and media for?\n",

    "The sphere can be a place we might encounter one another and what does that space include, not include. What do we want as a group of individuals and where do we gather to discuss it. \n",

    "How does mass media function as the public sphere – debate of politics through the press and now social media spaces. Or podcasts... \n",

    "Data that is working toward a positive goal. A public good that uses data to help support responses to that problem. Data feminism critiques this and is redefined in \"data democracy.\" We all get to decide what makes good data practices and this includes data ethics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building an algorithm on past practices is guaranteed to be prejudicial. Reputation algorithms for example to determine credit worthiness. Historical data and proxy variables are used to replace individual decisions. Better algorithms that are not based on proxies do exist. We can build a better algorithm! Machine learning training sets are often the source of the problem and overemphasize past practices. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we incorporate feedback? This is a good ways to make changes to the algorithms that respond to feedback loops where errors are discovered and the algorithms are modified. Sports data scientists do this well. \n",
